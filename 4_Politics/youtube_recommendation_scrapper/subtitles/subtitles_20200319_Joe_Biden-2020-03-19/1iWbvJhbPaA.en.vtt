00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.430
MICHAEL KIRK - Let’s start with something
a lot of people have told us.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.780
We’ll also go even further back in just
a moment, but just to go through the gears

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.800
one time, let’s talk a little bit about
Ukraine.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.640
A lot of people say this was a road test for
Putin, and lots of other reasons why he did

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.900
what he did in Crimea and Ukraine across the
hybrid war scheme.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
What did you see was happening there, from
your perspective?

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.660
JOHN BRENNAN - I think it really reflected
Mr. Putin’s interest in trying to correct

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:50.920
a historical wrong in his mind, as far as
Russia giving up part of what Putin considered

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.350
the Motherland that he wanted to reclaim,
the place where the Russian Orthodox Church

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.680
was born, and he’d never felt as though
Ukraine and Crimea should have left the Russian—even

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.380
earlier, the Soviet orbit.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.709
Therefore, I think Mr. Putin wanted to stop
also what he thought was an eastern march

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:19.159
on the part of the Western powers, NATO, EU.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.950
Therefore, I think he felt as though he needed
to act, because he tends to see things in

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.920
zero-sum fashion.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.039
I also believe that he felt that he could
do this with relative impunity, in terms of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.509
not having a military response from the West
or the United States.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.479
Therefore, the move was quick.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.310
But also, I think it reflected a broader strategic
interest on the part of Mr. Putin to secure

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.610
his near abroad, as it’s said, and do it
in a way that I think he felt confident was

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.599
not going to beget a Western military reaction.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:07.289
MICHAEL KIRK - When you look back on it from
our vantage point now, watching and thinking

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.420
about what happened in the summer of 2016
in the fall, there are also all kinds of just

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.570
tactical things he does, they do, that resonate:
a lot of fake news, a lot of information war,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.560
a lot of lying about things that happened.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.860
From your perch at the CIA, what were you
watching, and what were you learning?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.790
Or what felt new?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:41.040
JOHN BRENNAN - Mr. Putin is a creature of
his past and of his intelligence experience,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.630
and I do believe that he sees, and at that
time saw, the Russian intelligence services

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.200
as being a tremendous instrument of influence,
so that he could do things insidiously within

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.970
countries such as Ukraine, Georgia, even inside
of Europe, that he could try to exploit situations

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.400
that was going to advantage Russia.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.690
When we were getting closer to the 2016 presidential
election, I think some of the things that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.930
we were seeing early on were just symptoms
and indicators of Russia’s interest in trying

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.280
to manipulate foreign events to Russia’s
advantage.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.800
Any type of political process or election
I think Mr. Putin sees as ripe for Russian

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.180
intelligence-service engagement and also as
a fair amount of, I think, competition among

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.180
Russian intelligence services.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.590
They try to please the boss, and they do things,
both in terms of collecting information as

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.440
well as their active measures, whether it
be propaganda or even getting people to get

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.459
on the Russian payroll.

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:08.209
I think certainly CIA and intelligence professionals
had a good understanding about Mr. Putin’s

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.150
overarching strategic objectives, what he
was trying to accomplish, and therefore we

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:24.030
had our antenna up, looking for signs that
Mr. Putin was pursuing these objectives, whether

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.129
it be in the near abroad, whether it be in
Western Europe, or whether it be here in the

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.129
United States.

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:34.639
MICHAEL KIRK - So in things like sending in
[into Ukraine] uniformed soldiers with no

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.990
insignias on the uniforms, what did you make
of that?

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:47.909
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, in some respects, he
does things surreptitiously with his intelligence

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:55.259
services, but also, I think he likes to try
to intimidate his foes.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:01.669
So it was no secret to people that individuals
with military uniforms with no insignia, who

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.840
happened to show up in the eastern part of
Ukraine, fighting against the government forces,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.490
there was no doubt in anyone’s mind where
they came from and that they were sent there

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.740
by Mr. Putin.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.719
I think it was Mr. Putin’s way to, again,
try to bully others and to show that Russia

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:25.759
is there and is going to use its influence,
as well as its capabilities and its power,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.770
to achieve its objectives.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.999
MICHAEL KIRK - There were many arguments inside
the United States government about lethal

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.800
arming of the Ukrainian forces.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
…

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.800
What did you believe?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.689
Maybe you can't say what you’d advise the
president, but the idea that we should push

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:47.400
back at him, we should in some way let him
know he’s not going to get away with this,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.370
more robustly than we did.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.590
JOHN BRENNAN - Mr. Putin is, I think, a very
cunning individual, and he really takes the

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.029
measure of his adversaries and opponents.

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:07.150
When he moved into Ukraine, I do believe he
felt as though, if he did it with great emphasis

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.680
and force, that it was not going to engender
a military response on the part of the West.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.069
I do think he felt that, certainly toward
the last four years of the Obama administration,

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:27.539
that there was a predictability as far as
Washington’s reaction, and I think he recognized

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:34.860
that President Obama was reluctant to engage
in military conflicts, and therefore, would

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.710
use other instruments of U.S. power—sanctions,
for example.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.169
But I do think Mr. Putin’s decisions to
move into Ukraine, his decision to move into

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:54.349
Syria with military forces, was based on the
premise that there was not going to be a symmetric

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.650
Western military response.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:06.960
I felt as though, in some instances, we should
have made our reactions less predictable to

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960
Mr. Putin.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.099
I felt as though there were things that we
could have done that wouldn’t have got us

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:12.309
into a proxy war.

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:18.610
I remember being on the schoolyards of New
Jersey, when I grew up, and bullies try to

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.250
intimidate, and they keep moving forward unless
they get their nose bloodied a little bit.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.689
I felt as though Mr. Putin really needed to
get his nose bloodied.

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:34.529
I think it would have caused him to back off,
because like most bullies, he knows that he

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:35.849
can't stand up to others.

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:38.619
It’s a lot of bluster.

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:44.919
His willingness to use that type of intimidating
tactics, I think, could have been slowed,

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:51.099
if not reversed, if he encountered pushback.

00:07:51.099 --> 00:08:02.830
MICHAEL KIRK - Does he feel, in any way, as
the ergo attached to that, a kind of boldness

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:11.270
to begin to probe our election process, to
step forward in even a more robust way in

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:18.819
2015, in the initial sort of probes that Mr.
Clapper talked about back in ’15, and the

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:23.599
summer of 2016, which you know and lived through
vividly?

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:31.969
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, there is truth to the
narrative that Mr. Putin has—and Russians,

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:38.500
the Soviets before them, tried to engage in
interference in elections for many, many years,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.470
in the European theater in particular, but
also here in the United States.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:48.570
However, over time, there are new means and
new techniques and new technologies that make

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:57.781
engagement in the election process more available,
I guess, to manipulation by Russian intelligence

00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:59.500
services.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.380
With the emergence of the digital domain and
the cybersphere and the ability to hack into

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:14.280
email servers, I think there are just new
attack vectors and avenues for the Russian

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.280
intelligence services to take advantage of.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:22.080
I do think that they had the direction to
collect as much as they could, as they usually

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.800
do, about political processes.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.280
But also, there was a decision made on the
part of the Russians and Mr. Putin in particular

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:37.710
to authorize the leveraging of that intelligence
that was collected, information that was collected.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.540
MICHAEL KIRK - … You said they’d been
in our election process all the way back into

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.880
the Soviet Union times.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:49.770
But things, because of technology and other
things, have improved and enhanced their process.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:56.310
JOHN BRENNAN - The U.S. Intelligence Community
and the CIA were quite mindful of our responsibilities

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:05.071
to monitor and to assess Russian activities
that were trying to undermine U.S. national

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:09.090
security, especially in a presidential election
year.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:15.410
So we, CIA, worked very closely with FBI and
NSA and director of national intelligence

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:23.600
to make sure that we had our radar tuned and
that we were going to be very vigilant for

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.850
any type of Russian interference.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:33.240
We have a lot of experience and expertise
at CIA and at the other agencies in terms

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.240
of Russian tactics and techniques.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.850
We have some of the world’s greatest experts.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.940
And so we were, I think, well prepared to
pick up signs.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:54.630
As 2015 and 2016 rolled on, we did have clear
indications that the Russians were going to

00:10:54.630 --> 00:11:01.670
try to maybe reprise, in a much more intense
and pervasive manner, some of their earlier

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.980
efforts to interfere in elections.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:08.680
MICHAEL KIRK - When Mr. Clapper is talking
in Aspen in 2015, he is clearly concerned.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:17.920
He’s raising alarm bells, because he anticipated
something even worse than ever before, or

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.470
the sort of generalized call to arms in 2015.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:28.040
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, we saw a pattern over
the last several years, certainly in the second

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.850
half of the Obama administration, when relations
between Washington and Moscow were declining

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.100
as a result of a number of factors.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.990
The effort to reset the relationship between
Russia and the United States had faltered.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.930
We had the Russian SVR [Russia's External
Intelligence Service] illegals that were rounded

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:50.040
up here in the United States, and it was a
clear indication that the Russians were continuing

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:56.420
on their usual course of trying to undermine
U.S. national security.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.840
Then we saw what Russia did in Ukraine, and
there was an aggressiveness, I think, across

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.140
the board.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:10.640
We saw things happening in Europe in elections
there, in the 2012-2013-2014 time period.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.680
So there was, in some respects, a building
crescendo, I guess, as we were entering the

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.590
presidential election campaign season, of
Russian aggressiveness.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:28.770
Therefore, we were very concerned that we
might be seeing Russian efforts to undermine

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:34.550
the integrity and credibility of the U.S.
presidential election of 2016.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:44.720
MICHAEL KIRK - People in the government high
up in the Obama administration say that they

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:52.660
expected espionage, but that was a sort of
standard-operating-procedure game that’s

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.130
played by us and by them and by everybody
in the world around elections, but that the

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:02.540
fear was the weaponization of that information,
the way that it had been used in Ukraine and

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:08.660
even in Estonia; that they had a new toy to
play with, and that that was releasing that

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.692
information, and that they’d seen a little
bit of it around the [then-Assistant Secretary

00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:16.680
of State for European and Eurasian Affairs]
Toria Nuland wiretapped phone call, when they

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.110
released it and made political points out
of something like that.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.070
Do I have that about right?

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.580
JOHN BRENNAN - The Russians and the Soviets
before them were very proficient, let me put

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.420
it that way, in the use of active measures
on the propaganda front.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:39.670
For many, many years they would try to put
into the Western media circles stories that

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:46.150
advanced Russian interests and tried to harm
U.S. and Western interests.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.350
The real distinction over the last several
years, again, is this digital environment,

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:58.160
where now you have so many new opportunities
to apply your intelligence wares.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:05.140
First of all, social media has given intelligence
services, especially the Russians, a lot of

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:11.590
opportunity to put things out into that social
media environment, information that purports

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:16.540
to be real, but is part of their active measures
influenced propaganda effort.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:22.560
At the same time, Russian espionage activities,
in terms of collecting intelligence that would

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.990
be used in the past to inform Russian active
measures, now in and of itself can become

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:34.180
a weapon, be weaponized, so that you can take
emails and information that you collect from

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:40.360
that digital environment, from servers and
networks and email servers, and put it out

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:46.080
in an effort to try to embarrass your targets.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:52.070
What the Russian services did, and what they
are very capable of doing now, is reaching

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:58.990
into that cybersphere, collecting a lot of
information, as we saw from the Democratic

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:04.740
National Committee, DCCC [Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee], and then taking judicious

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:11.930
and selective use of information in emails
to be able to put out as a way to again advance

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:18.590
their interests by embarrassing individuals
that they see as their targets.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.740
MICHAEL KIRK - Before we go much further,
let’s go backward, just one more time, for

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.980
a little back story.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:35.150
Let’s go to 2011-2012, the protests in Moscow.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:42.490
The way the story goes, social media invigorated
people who would otherwise not have come out,

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.220
would not have come out in nearly the numbers
that they came out at those times, with a

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:52.970
sort of angry response to Putin, saying, “Medvedev
is gone; I'm going to take it [the presidency]

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.660
again,” and lots of other reasons ; people
using cell phones to verify it and run it

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.600
on the Web and people hitting the streets,
confirming, I suppose, because it happens

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:10.710
at the same time that Arab Spring is happening,
Putin’s paranoia, or his view that the hand

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.260
of America is all over all of this.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.620
And he doesn’t apparently—according to
people we talked to over there, he’s not

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.730
at the time very conversant with what is the
Web and how is the West using the Web, and

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.680
[he] is shocked and amazed at everything,
from Hillary Clinton’s statements being

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.560
broadcast all over the Internet to everything
else that’s happening to him.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.780
He has to ascribe it to something.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.480
He ascribes it to us and our use of social
media.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.529
Help me understand your perspective on that.

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:47.880
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, I think Mr. Putin has
an affliction like, unfortunately, many world

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.800
leaders have, which is an innate sense of
insecurity as well as paranoia.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:01.710
I think Mr. Putin looked at developments around
the world, as well as inside of Russia, as

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:09.080
being carried out, in many respects, by Western
intelligence services.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.970
Over the years, I was quite frankly shocked
when I would see so many things ascribed to

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.260
CIA that CIA had no engagement in whatsoever.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:24.209
And I think Mr. Putin would look at developments,
particularly inside of Moscow, if there was

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:32.740
opposition activity, or if there were protests,
or any type of actions that were counter to

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:39.660
what he wanted, he saw CIA’s hand behind
it and saw the U.S.’s hand behind it.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:46.200
Therefore, I think he had this innate sense
of almost persecution.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.390
Also, I think he felt as though not only he
was being persecuted, but the Russian people

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.140
were, and he felt as though he had to stand
up for them.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:04.160
But I must tell you that a lot of things that
Mr. Putin thought were a direct result of

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.310
CIA efforts absolutely were not.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.780
MICHAEL KIRK - It’s an interesting thing.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:15.210
Here is a guy who’s a KGB officer, and we’re
now back in 1987-88, who’s a counterintelligence

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.210
guy, right?

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.370
He’s supposed to be paranoid.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.930
He’s supposed to anticipate bad things coming
in his direction.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:27.360
Talk to me a little bit about Putin, from
what you know, from Putin—profile Putin

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.730
the KGB officer in Dresden and at the end
of the Soviet Union.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:38.190
JOHN BRENNAN - I think Mr. Putin was always
a hardworking, diligent intelligence officer.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:44.710
But he joined Russian intelligence, I think
during their waning days, in the latter years

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:51.790
of the Cold War, when they really felt aggrieved
and the much lesser power than the United

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:58.650
States, so I think that just reinforced some
of his feelings of insecurity, and I think

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:05.420
that carried over to him when he then entered
public office in Russia.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:10.560
I really feel as though he looked upon the
United States as being this enormous power

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:20.100
that, in his mind, I think unfairly used its
power to subjugate Soviet Union Russian people.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:27.920
I do think Mr. Putin had a real sense of this
second-class status, that was a bit of a chip

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.990
on his shoulder, that he always had to prove
himself.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:37.710
You know, partly that was also the way he
was brought up in the period of time, and

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:43.910
again felt as though he was being targeted
by others.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.380
I think he always felt an urge to fight back.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:56.059
Therefore, when he rose up the ladder of the
Russian political system, he was doing it

00:19:56.059 --> 00:19:57.380
as a sense of competition.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:03.890
He was doing it in a sense that he was trying
to, I think, gain favor at the expense of

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:04.890
others.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:11.640
Again, I think it just reflects the prism
that he looked at the world with, but also

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.240
he looked at his country with.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.059
Again, I think in many respects, he’s a
loner.

00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:24.090
He looks out for himself, but recognizes that
he is dependent on other support in order

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.250
to continue to pursue his goals and objectives.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:38.179
MICHAEL KIRK - He must be an amazing actor
in some ways, to go from Dresden to St. Petersburg,

00:20:38.179 --> 00:20:42.300
sign up with a democrat, [Anatoly Sobchak,
mayor of St. Petersburg], rise up in the ranks,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.530
and then find himself, six years later, the
head of the newly created FSB [Federal Security

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.450
Service of the Russian Federation] and soon
prime minister and then president.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:56.240
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, I think he has this very
strong survival instinct, so when the Soviet

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.990
Union was collapsing, I think he was looking
for, how is he going to survive this traumatic

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.210
experience?

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:10.690
Also, then when you had Mr. Yeltsin emerge
as the president, I think Mr. Putin’s effort

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:16.350
was to try to ensure that he was going to
be able to flourish professionally during

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.550
that time.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:24.480
I think he had some chameleon qualities that
he could adapt to the realities around him.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.210
But I think he was always driven by a sense
that he wanted to be at the top of the heap.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:37.110
In that respect, I think, again, he is a cunning
individual from the standpoint of being able

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:44.530
to navigate some of the political shoals inside
of Russia, but also in some respects he’s

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:50.050
a very astute observer of the international
environment, and that’s why I think he takes

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:55.420
the measure of his opponents and adversaries
and counterparts around the world, and he

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:01.260
tries to find their weaknesses or their soft
spots, and takes full advantage of it.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.650
I think he has been able to get the better
of a number of individuals.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:11.060
MICHAEL KIRK - When he was appointed president,
you're at the agency.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.710
What was the consensus about him?

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.809
Was there a consensus about what was going
to happen?

00:22:14.809 --> 00:22:17.110
Was he going to be a soft authoritarian?

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:22.290
Was he going to be a continuation of the democratic
principles that Yeltsin was trying to bring?

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.670
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, it certainly was a break
from the Yeltsin years, and especially in

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:31.030
the latter Yeltsin years, when people were
really concerned that this individual, President

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:36.980
Yeltsin, was in a state of decline in terms
of physical health as well as mental health.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:42.850
Putin arrived with the reputation of being
a serious person, with intelligence background,

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.070
somebody that the CIA certainly was looking
at very, very closely.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:52.520
But he, in some respects, from our perspective—and
I wasn’t following Russia in depth at the

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:59.230
time—[was] a bit of an enigma, because I
don’t think we knew enough about him and

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:04.230
what his ultimate aspirations and worldview
were.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.410
That emerged over time.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:16.220
But I think people saw him as somebody who
was going to become immersed in his position.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:23.210
But still, Russia was climbing out of the
Soviet era still, and there was a fair amount

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:29.450
of jockeying among a number of Russian political
luminaries.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:35.510
We didn’t know whether or not Mr. Putin
was going to be a passing phase or if he was

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:41.070
going to be an enduring individual from the
standpoint of Russia’s political future.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:47.290
MICHAEL KIRK - He gives an amazing speech
in 2007 in Munich, where he essentially declares

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:55.820
war on the world in some—a hell of a far
piece from where he was when he first took

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.930
over in 1999.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:03.010
JOHN BRENNAN - What we saw was an increasing
assertiveness on the part of Mr. Putin, and

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:08.040
I think it was smart of him to start out rather
slowly.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:16.140
I think he cut his political teeth when he
was the vice mayor of St. Petersburg.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.510
He was, again, a pretty good student, a good
intelligence officer from the standpoint of

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.380
collecting intelligence, taking a book on
people, and finding out where the seams might

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.760
be, where the opportunities might be.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.870
Therefore, by the time he had several years
under his belt and then came back into the

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:43.720
presidency, I think he had much greater self-confidence
and a much greater sense of what he not just

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.190
wanted to do, but what he needed to do, in
his mind, in order to solidify his political

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.630
base in Russia.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:59.270
When he became president for a second time,
I think it was at that point that he decided

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.390
he was going to be president for life, and
he was not going to give up power.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:11.100
He was going to amass power not just on the
political scene in Moscow, but also on the

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:18.290
world stage, because I do think he understands
that time is not on Russia’s side.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.771
When you look at the demographics, you look
at the lack of diversity in the economy, you

00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:28.700
look at the brain drain, the loss of entrepreneurial
and technical talent, I think he sees that

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:38.559
he needs to seize the moment and try to be
as assertive as possible, because over time,

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:46.740
Russia’s influence, I think, he sees would
wane, because if you look at the Russian prospectus—and

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:53.370
I think he did look at it—he saw that he
needed to do things maybe sooner rather than

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:59.260
later, protect his flanks that he thought
were under assault by encroachment from the

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:08.010
West, but also demonstrate to others and potential
client states that Russia was a force that

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:16.980
was going to reassert itself on the world
stage, because I think he does view the superpower

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.150
competition between the United States and
Russia in zero-sum fashion.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:27.140
Therefore, when he sees that the United States
is weakened or diminished in any way, to include

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:32.720
on the domestic political front in Washington,
it only redounds to Russia’s interests,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:39.750
and that’s where I think Mr. Putin really
tries to, again, bloody the United States’

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:45.140
nose, because he feels as though, if that
happens, it just accrues to his benefit.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:51.060
MICHAEL KIRK - One of the things we watched
develop in this film is his creation of cyber-

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:58.840
and other weapons, so that he can fight above
his weight in a kind of asymmetrical way.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:04.030
We see the first instance of this is Estonia,
when they shut the place down.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.950
What did you make of what they were doing
in Estonia?

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:11.800
What was the meaning of that to you?

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:20.780
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, intelligence services,
including the Russians, recognized that modern-day

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:31.900
warfare and modern-day political influence
has a lot more avenues of pursuit than it

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:39.380
did in the last century, again, because there
are ways to manipulate the cyber realm and

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:45.630
to either send signals or to actually disable
or cripple others.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:52.340
In places like Estonia and places like Georgia,
as well as in Ukraine, I think Mr. Putin and

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:59.140
his services recognized that they can do things
without having to assert, at least in a physical

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.830
way, Russia’s military capabilities.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:12.250
You can do things that are more insidious,
maybe a bit more subtle, but yet as impactful,

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:17.669
because you can do things in the cyber realm
that [are] going to bring down infrastructure,

00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:20.299
bring down capabilities of other countries.

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:27.220
Again, as part of the bullying tactics and
intimidation, it’s a way to send a full

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:32.780
broadside against either adversaries or potential
adversaries, or ones who might be getting

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.010
out of line a bit.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:40.380
When Mr. Putin looks at the Baltic states,
he recognizes a number of things.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.860
One is that he feels a certain obligation
to some of the Russian-speaking peoples that

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.860
are there.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:54.970
He also is very concerned that these states
that were once under the yoke of the Soviets

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:59.050
should not venture too far to the West.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:06.090
I do think Mr. Putin is willing to pull some
levers, and it’s obvious and known to everybody

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.280
that Russia is pulling the levers.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.970
But he’s able to, again, send the message
that he wants.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:20.400
But he also, I think, has a good sense of
brinksmanship as far as what he can do without

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.330
a response against him that he would prefer
to avoid.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:31.030
MICHAEL KIRK - Just purely from a mechanical
perspective, your observation on—is he,

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:38.780
in a place like Estonia, in a place like Ukraine,
is he pushing the “go” button, or is he

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.740
like the head of a movie studio, where he’s
got a lot of independent producers who do

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.740
things?

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.750
You mentioned earlier that they want to appeal
to him by doing great things that he acknowledges

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.400
and really appreciates.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:30:00.690
So in places like Ukraine, in the hacking
that they used, even in Georgia and Ukraine,

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:07.400
but also Estonia, is it individuals and kind
of—he calls them patriotic hackers.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:14.500
Or is it the GRU [military intelligence] general
[who] says, “Go,” or the FSB general [who]

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.500
says, “Go”?

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:22.090
JOHN BRENNAN - I think Mr. Putin has given
his intelligence services a fair amount of

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:27.110
authority to move forward and implement some
of his policy objectives.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:35.920
That said, I am also confident that any Russian
action that has potential strategic consequence,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:42.770
such as taking down cybersystems, digital
systems, infrastructure in other countries,

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:49.730
whether it be in Estonia, Georgia, Ukraine
areas, that’s something that he would have

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.870
given his personal authorization for.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:31:01.400
I don’t think Russian intelligence chiefs
want to go beyond their ski tips, as far as

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:08.120
what it is that they are doing that could
escalate and spiral.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:15.930
So I do think things such as that, or to engage
in an election that could have some real significant

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:22.570
repercussions, I am confident, very confident,
that they would have run those things by Mr.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.789
Putin.

00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:28.020
The actual details of how it would be implemented
is something that I think Mr. Putin would

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:37.040
leave to his intelligence chiefs, but the
“go” signal, the green light would have

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040
come from Mr. Putin.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.160
MICHAEL KIRK - So when Cozy Bear jumps inside
the State Department in ’15 and the White

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.090
House and other places, you're alerted?

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.750
You're alerted to this?

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:54.890
And you assume it’s Putin saying, “Let’s
go over there and see what we can clean out

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.890
of the closet”?

00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:02.039
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, there's a real distinction
between what intelligence services collect

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:06.990
and then what they actually do with that collection.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:12.320
I don’t think the intelligence services
need to get Mr. Putin’s authorization to

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.090
collect against their principal targets, whether
it be against the intelligence community of

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.410
the United States or State Department or even
the White House.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:26.980
That intelligence collection is just part
of the M.O. of intelligence services.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:32.090
But to take information that is collected
maybe against those targets and then to release

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:40.700
it, I guess it depends on the specificity
as well as on the potential backlash.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.910
So I think some of these things are sui generis
from the standpoint of depending on what it

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:50.650
is that they're doing, they will go up and
seek Mr. Putin’s approval.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:55.419
But the mere collection of intelligence is
something that I think the GRU and SVR and

00:32:55.419 --> 00:32:58.160
FSB do on a regular basis.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.520
Taking some of that information and seeding
it into maybe some other propaganda, I think

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.920
that also is part of the Russian M.O.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:16.590
But to do something that is going to be potentially
explosive as well as disruptive, I do think

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:22.570
that those intelligence chiefs in Russia,
the ones that have been able to survive over

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:29.140
the course of many years, they know, I think,
the limits of their prerogatives and their

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.140
authorizations.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:36.590
That’s where they go to Mr. Putin and say,
“We plan to do this or this,” to make

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.820
sure you get his head nod.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:43.660
MICHAEL KIRK - So in 2016, …When you first
get an inclination of the thing that is going

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:53.559
to occupy all of our minds last summer, the
first I can find in the press of you really

00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:57.830
talking about it is late June or early July.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:03.830
But you must have known much earlier that
Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear and other things

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.950
were happening with the DNC.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.790
Were you aware of things earlier?

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:13.560
Tell me when you were aware of what was happening,
and that it was kind of different in some

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.560
kind.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:22.900
JOHN BRENNAN - CIA always has its counterintelligence
radar up for Soviet efforts to harm our national

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:31.149
security, and there are things that we see
that give us indications about the Russians

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:36.000
going down a particular path or trying to
exploit a certain opportunity.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.050
It’s our responsibility and obligation to
make sure that we keep our senior officials

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:46.000
in the White House informed, that we keep
our FBI brethren informed.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.510
So, through the course of 2015 and 2016, CIA
was fulfilling its responsibilities to monitor,

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.830
to collect and to inform.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:03.040
I am loath to give any particular timeframe
or dates or reasons because that’s part

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.520
of the intelligence business.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:13.290
We look at the situation, we identify certain
bits and pieces of data, and we correlate

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.290
them.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:17.340
It’s like people who, I think, observe the
weather.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:23.320
You see certain barometric conditions that
are starting to form, and you say, “You

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.200
know, this seems as though it’s ripe for
a tornado to develop.”

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.599
What you try to do is to track it and to see
whether or not those early indicators are

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:37.200
true indicators of a rising storm.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:45.119
MICHAEL KIRK - We start to hear about it in
some ways in late June/early July of 2016.

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:49.030
What made it suddenly come on our radar screens?

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:56.310
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, during the summer of
2016, there was a fair amount of press attention

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:04.280
to various efforts on the part of hackers
to get into the systems.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:11.650
Obviously, the media spotlight was quite heavy
on the presidential election and the campaign

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:18.340
season and the contenders for the presidency.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:24.240
There was a lot that was in the air, and there
was a lot of interest on the part of folks

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.190
downtown to see what the Russians might be
up to.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.500
Again, we were looking very carefully.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.000
We had our sensors out.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.830
We had our ears attuned and our eyes directed
on the places that we thought the Russians

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.000
might be working on.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.950
Things started to emerge, and as good intelligence
officers, we were looking for indicators that

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:53.890
might come through many different collections
systems, whether they be CIA, NSA, FBI.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:37:01.400
But also, we were putting many, many years
of expertise, overlaying that over those indicators;

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:08.410
also touching base with our foreign counterparts,
some of those European services that had up-close

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:12.230
and direct experience with some of the Russian
activities.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:17.140
So this all was part of the effort to discern
exactly what Russia was doing.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.460
MICHAEL KIRK - There must have been a moment
where you said, “This is different in kind

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:27.210
in some way, and I know,” and your alarm
bells as an experienced person were ringing

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.420
pretty loudly that a tornado was on the horizon.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.420
When was that?

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.800
JOHN BRENNAN - It was in the summer of 2016.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:40.400
I don’t want to be more specific than that
because I do want to be, again, mindful of

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.830
the need to continue to be able to track and
monitor some of the things that Russia is

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:45.830
doing.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:52.250
But in the summer it was quite clear to me
that we were seeing a campaign on the part

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:57.480
of the Russians, that this was not just sort
of the usual stuff that we’d seen before;

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:08.330
that it was a much more aggressive, much more
intense, and much more worrisome effort, because

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:16.170
the exploitation of the cyber environment
gave us real concern that the Russians could

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:22.400
be up to things that we hadn’t seen before,
and we didn’t know what they were going

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.110
to try to do.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:29.690
We had seen, over the course of years, what
they had done in Europe, to include financial

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:39.240
payments and, again, intimidation efforts,
even blackmail of political parties and political

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.240
officials.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.350
In some respects, they stoop to whatever tactic
they can.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:51.700
But this storm was brewing in the summer,
which is why I decided that I was going to

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.940
raise this issue with one of my principal
counterparts, [FSB Director] Mr. Alexander

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.869
Bortnikov, on the 4th of August.

00:38:56.869 --> 00:39:06.100
MICHAEL KIRK - Before we get to Mr. Bortnikov’s—the
phone call, you're worried enough, from what

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.420
I gather, that you want to hold this really
closely.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:14.349
This is not something that’s in the PDB
[President’s Daily Brief] in the morning,

00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:15.349
with the president.

00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:20.790
This is not something that you're spreading
around for the month of July at least.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:26.250
JOHN BRENNAN - In my intelligence career,
I've been involved in many, many sensitive

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:30.230
intelligence programs and activities.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.500
Getting bin Laden was one of the most sensitive.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.680
It was held to a very few people.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:42.790
But I must say that counterintelligence cases
are the ones that the CIA and the FBI hold

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.859
most tightly for a variety of reasons.

00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:52.369
One is that sometimes it involves U.S. persons
who have been recruited by the Russians, and

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:57.450
you want to make sure that you protect that
information for the privacy of individuals

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.869
who may be suspected but not actually guilty.

00:39:59.869 --> 00:40:03.290
In addition, though, it’s an ongoing case.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:07.960
And what you're trying to do is uncover what
the Russians are involved in.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.730
In order to do that, you have to make sure
that you keep that information very tightly

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:17.430
held, because any exposure, any leak could
be devastating, in terms of shutting down

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:23.109
a counterintelligence investigation, because
your leads will go dry.

00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:30.350
Therefore, when we saw that the Russians were
actively and aggressively trying to interfere

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:36.320
in our election, during the election period,
we needed to make sure that we did everything

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.260
possible to aggressively pursue that, to uncover
and discover what they were doing, but at

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.869
the same time protect that information.

00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:50.450
So we briefed a very small number of people
at the highest levels of government in the

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:56.130
executive branch, as well as in the Congress,
to make sure that they were aware that CIA,

00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:04.980
along with our intelligence partners, were
actively and aggressively seeking to uncover,

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:09.380
and then as directed and as needed, to thwart
these Russian efforts.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:13.360
MICHAEL KIRK - In those early days, who knows?

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:19.320
Before you send the sealed letter over to
the White House in early August, as it’s

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.750
been reported, how small is the circle that
you draw?

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:31.210
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, first of all, I met with
my people at CIA who were uncovering this

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:37.570
information, and I wanted to really understand
what it is that we knew, what our gaps were,

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.410
our confidence level.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:45.150
We had some very intense and long meetings
at CIA headquarters about this.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:51.530
Once it was apparent to me that we were encountering
something that was unlike what we had seen

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:58.650
before, I reached out to the White House and
wanted to have a meeting with the president.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:05.780
So I had a phone conversation with one of
my close colleagues down at the White House,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.960
and I said, “I need to see the president.”

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:16.859
I was able to get in and see the president
very quickly and walked him through it and

00:42:16.859 --> 00:42:23.590
told him and the national security adviser
and one or two other people from the White

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:29.109
House, what we were encountering, what we
had to deal with, and how we were going to

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:30.990
handle it.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:37.240
I talked through some of the mechanisms that
we would keep them informed in consultation

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.670
with the president and the others at the White
House.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:46.490
We agreed that I needed to reach out immediately
to the Gang of Eight—that’s the leadership

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:51.950
in the Senate and the House of Representatives—and
to make sure that they were aware of this,

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:59.340
because we thought that it was most important
for our senior legislators to know what the

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.030
Russians were up to, but also how were we
going to handle it.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:07.310
MICHAEL KIRK - When you go in and see the
president, can you put a date on it for us,

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:08.310
or do you want to keep that?

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:10.460
JOHN BRENNAN - It was in the summer, early
summer.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.460
It was certainly before I spoke—

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.460
MICHAEL KIRK - Really?

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.830
JOHN BRENNAN - It was certainly before I spoke
to Mr. Bortnikov.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:16.830
MICHAEL KIRK - Yeah, so before that, of course.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:17.830
JOHN BRENNAN - Absolutely.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.350
MICHAEL KIRK - So sometime in July.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:25.740
How do you say it to the president, Mr. Brennan?

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.630
And how does he react?

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:34.270
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, I've had some experience
over the years in briefing presidents and

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:39.470
making sure that they understood exactly what
it is that we know, how we know it.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:46.690
I wanted to not over-brief it and to make
sure the president understood the foundations

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:53.890
of our understanding, and also make sure the
president understood how we would be able

00:43:53.890 --> 00:44:00.390
to collect further on this, what the limitations
were as well as the sensitivity of it.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:05.020
That’s one of the things that I wanted to
make sure that I underscored, the sensitivity

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.300
of this type of information.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.610
MICHAEL KIRK - What do you mean, sensitivity?

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:14.230
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, again, in any counterintelligence
investigation, there are an array of collection

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:19.800
capabilities that you try to leverage, and
you try to protect those sources of methods.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:25.441
So I want to make sure that I was able to
share the substance of the information, but

00:44:25.441 --> 00:44:31.940
also wanted to make sure they understood how
it is that we acquire the information and

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.740
why is it that we have the confidence in it.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.930
MICHAEL KIRK - So you can be specific with
the president.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:40.830
You can say whatever it is, “We have somebody
in there, we have technology; we have”—

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.540
JOHN BRENNAN - I was specific with the president.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.890
I was specific with the Gang of Eight in terms
of how we knew it.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:51.480
And I wanted to make sure that I highlighted
the sensitivity.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:58.760
The president, national security adviser,
the Gang of Eight and some of the other senior

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:05.240
members of the National Security Council were
fully aware of the information we had.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:11.570
Now, not every bit in detail I shared because
there was no need to, but they needed to have

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:15.380
a good understanding and grasp of the foundations
of this information.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.380
MICHAEL KIRK - The president’s reaction
in that initial conversation?

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:26.890
JOHN BRENNAN - The president, in the summer
of 2016, was already well aware and I think

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:34.970
appreciative of the intelligence community’s
capabilities, and also was well aware of Russian

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.089
activities around the globe, too, including
elections.

00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:39.280
So I think what he—

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.260
MICHAEL KIRK - You mean from the PDB, the
briefing.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.260
JOHN BRENNAN - Yeah.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.849
Over the years, we've been briefing him on
what the Russians were doing in a lot of other

00:45:44.849 --> 00:45:48.110
elections and the Russian cyber capabilities
or whatever.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:55.550
So it was not shocking or surprising, but
it was something that was, I think, worrying

00:45:55.550 --> 00:46:02.280
to all of us, particularly since we didn’t
know the extent of what it is that the Russians

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:10.170
were engaged in, and we didn’t know how
far they would go to really threaten the integrity

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.170
of the election.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.640
MICHAEL KIRK - They hadn’t yet done the
Wiki dump?

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.650
JOHN BRENNAN - No, there were still things
that the Russians were—ultimately did.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.980
MICHAEL KIRK - That they hadn’t done yet
when you have this conversation.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.980
JOHN BRENNAN - Mm-hmm.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:28.300
MICHAEL KIRK - But people have described him
as grave at that, kind of countenance of gravity

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.730
was really—yes?

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:36.119
JOHN BRENNAN - The president was very concerned
about what the Russians were doing.

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:44.530
The president was very focused on what it
is we needed to do in order to uncover and

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:45.880
to stop them from doing it.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:52.150
But the president also, I think, was rightly
concerned about doing something in the middle

00:46:52.150 --> 00:47:00.890
of a presidential election season, to thwart
the Russians but at the same time not assist

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:07.869
the Russians by doing something that was going
to raise even more questions about the credibility

00:47:07.869 --> 00:47:09.821
and integrity of the election.

00:47:09.821 --> 00:47:12.310
The president was fixated on this.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:16.370
He told us to do everything we could, from
a collection standpoint, to make sure that

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.020
we kept him informed, which we did.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:29.240
But also, he was, I think, at that point then
really thinking about what course of action

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:40.070
he should take in terms of public statements,
actions, as well as private actions.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:45.090
He was thinking about it as the president
of the United States and wanting to make sure

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:54.460
that the 2016 presidential election could
be carried out in the most fair, free and

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.300
uninterrupted manner as possible.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:04.210
MICHAEL KIRK - You had said earlier, John,
that you knew Putin, and you know how it works.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:09.780
You know how the vertical power works there
to get something done.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.630
When you finally are convinced by your guys,
and it doesn’t sound like it took a long

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:19.970
time for them to convince you that this was
happening, are you saying: “This is a Putin

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:20.970
operation.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.790
This is a direct-line Putin operation”?

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:25.829
Is Putin your guy from almost from the beginning?

00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:27.470
And do you tell the president that?

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:31.580
JOHN BRENNAN - From the very beginning, I
made it clear to the president that it was—certainly

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:39.190
CIA’s considered view that this was an activity
and a campaign that was authorized by Mr.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.190
Putin.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.810
MICHAEL KIRK - Did he want to pull [then-Director
of National Intelligence James] Clapper and

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.720
[then-FBI Director James] Comey in on this?

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.079
Are they already part of this by then?

00:48:47.079 --> 00:48:51.530
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, after I met with my people
at the agency, I made a number of phone calls

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:56.290
and spoke to the White House to get on the
president’s calendar.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:00.270
I also, right away, spoke to Jim Clapper.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:04.510
Jim was not available to come down to the
White House with me at the time when I met

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:10.329
with the president, but I wanted to make sure
that Jim was fully apprised of what it was

00:49:10.329 --> 00:49:18.530
that we had come to understand, and what I
was going to brief the president about.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:25.780
Right after I briefed the president, as I
recall, I spoke with Jim Comey and let him

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:31.940
know exactly what it is that we needed to
do together and had a conversation shortly

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:37.930
thereafter with Mike Rogers from NSA, because
the president recognized that for any type

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:44.010
of counterintelligence effort that needs to
be undertaken by the U.S. government, the

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:52.590
CIA, the FBI and NSA are the three principal
agencies that really need to take this and

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:55.460
do everything possible to understand it better.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:01.760
MICHAEL KIRK - Did you guys know that Guccifer
and [Julian] Assange from WikiLeaks were waiting

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:11.200
in the wings right before the DNC dump, or
did that come as a surprise?

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:18.619
JOHN BRENNAN - We were looking at what the
Russians were doing.

00:50:18.619 --> 00:50:24.090
We were working through what options the Russians
were considering in terms of taking advantage

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:29.990
of some of their espionage exploits and their
cyberhacking activities.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:34.920
We were looking at the various mechanisms
and distribution systems that they could take

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.230
advantage of.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:43.970
Again, our experts CIA, and FBI and NSA’s
experts, identified the more likely culprits

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:45.200
in this.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:53.020
Again, we have a lot of expertise that we
were able to take advantage of, so when things

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:58.900
started to show up and come out, we were able
to put together some bits and pieces of information

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:03.370
and intelligence, as well as look at it against
the backdrop of things that had happened previously.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:13.339
MICHAEL KIRK - The meaning of Wiki’s release
right before the Democratic National Convention,

00:51:13.339 --> 00:51:17.369
to you: What was the importance of that to
you?

00:51:17.369 --> 00:51:24.020
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, we were following with
great interest the timing of some of these

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:29.730
activities in terms of when something would
be released, and did it happen on the eve

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:35.120
of a certain development or event such as
the Democratic National Convention?

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:42.740
By looking at the timing and the action, one
could then have a good sense of motivation,

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:49.109
and it also would help to validate some of
the things that we had come already to understand

00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:51.260
or to believe.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.260
So we were tracking that.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.510
I think that’s a very important part of
the intelligence business.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:59.410
You look at actions, you look at developments,
you look at statements, and you look at things

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:06.470
along a timeline, and then do some correlations,
because it frequently will give you a sense

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.849
of motivation and objectives.

00:52:08.849 --> 00:52:16.690
MICHAEL KIRK - So by now, the press is going
basically crazy about this story, and everybody

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:24.500
is pushing, I would assume the Clinton campaign
is also saying, “Oh, my God,” right, because

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.970
they know.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:34.150
Was it at this early stage, did you know the
Russians favored Trump and were after Mrs.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.150
Clinton?

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:39.310
JOHN BRENNAN - The Intelligence Community
assessment that ultimately was published and

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:45.570
released to the public in early January, it
had, you know, three principal conclusions:

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:51.560
one, to undermine the integrity of the election
and interfere in that electoral process; two,

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:59.690
to denigrate Hillary Clinton, either if she
won or to stop her or to muddy her when she

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:05.359
emerged as president; and then for Mr. Trump
to be advantaged by these Russian efforts.

00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:14.680
And looking back, it was CIA’s judgment—I
think the judgment of the other agencies as

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:22.630
well, early on, that the Russian strategy
was designed to promote the prospects for

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.260
Mr. Trump.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:34.540
In the summer of 2016, it was our assessment
that the Russians were trying to enhance Mr.

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:38.089
Trump’s prospects for electoral victory.

00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:44.339
Even though it was our assessment that the
Russians didn’t see him as the likely winner,

00:53:44.339 --> 00:53:49.550
but they had a multipronged campaign strategy.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:56.829
So yes, early on, in 2016, it was our view
that the Russians were trying to improve Mr.

00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:59.210
Putin’s [sic] prospects, which they thought
were unlikely.

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.400
MICHAEL KIRK - You mean Mr. Trump’s prospects.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.619
JOHN BRENNAN - Mr. Trump’s prospects.

00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:09.060
In 2016 they were trying to enhance Mr. Trump’s
prospects to emerge victorious in the election,

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.690
even though they thought it was a bit of a
long shot.

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:16.310
MICHAEL KIRK - And Mr. Trump’s response
must have been fascinating to you: “Hey!

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:21.590
Go find Hillary’s—hey, Russia, if you're
breaking in, go find it,” he treats it frivolously

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:22.590
almost, yeah?

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:29.980
JOHN BRENNAN - Mr. Trump’s comments about
Mr. Putin and Russia and Russian intelligence

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.750
have been baffling to me for quite some time.

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:41.099
During the election campaign, when he encouraged
the Russians to release emails, to his favorable

00:54:41.099 --> 00:54:52.040
comments about Mr. Putin, these are things
that I still am very, very puzzled about.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:55:03.380
MICHAEL KIRK - The [Washington] Post writes
a story about a letter you send over in early

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:10.200
August to the White House for the eyes of
four people, the president and three other

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.290
people.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.750
Did such a letter actually go to the White
House?

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:18.940
And what was it about, if you’ve already
had a conversation with the president and

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:19.940
others?

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:28.820
JOHN BRENNAN - On the morning of the day that
I briefed the president, I sent over a very

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:35.565
short note, cryptic note, that was for the
president, the national security adviser,

00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:45.140
and a couple of other folks down there, that
gave the topic, the subject of the briefing

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:49.100
that I was going to provide to the president.

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.119
I wanted to make sure that they understood
the gravity of what it was that I needed to

00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:58.040
brief, and therefore getting on the president’s
schedule.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.720
And I said I needed some time to basically
walk him through this.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:07.150
I wanted to make sure that they knew it, so
I gave them a very, very brief heads-up in

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.440
a very short note that I sent over there in
the morning.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.829
MICHAEL KIRK - Do you remember what you said?

00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:18.140
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, I talked about: this
deals with Russia and interference in the

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.140
election.

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:27.630
I think I had a few other lines in there,
but I wanted to reserve the substance of the

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:33.240
brief, given the sensitivity of it, for my
oral briefing that I gave to the president.

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:39.369
MICHAEL KIRK - And is it true the report that
it was to be in he hands of only four people,

00:56:39.369 --> 00:56:40.450
and it was to be returned?

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:45.280
JOHN BRENNAN - There were four people that
were in the briefing for the president.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.240
It was the president, national security adviser,
deputy national security adviser, and the

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:55.320
president’s chief of staff and myself.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.320
That was it.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.020
MICHAEL KIRK - It feels like an unbelievably
historic moment.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:02.700
JOHN BRENNAN - It was one that certainly I’ll
remember.

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:05.910
I understood the gravity of the issue.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:12.670
I understood the importance of what it was
that I was going to tell the president, not

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:16.770
because it was a one-time briefing; it was
because we had our work cut out for us in

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.310
the coming months.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:23.060
It was going to be a very, very challenging
intelligence effort.

00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:30.640
It was going to be a very challenging policy
effort as well, from the standpoint of what

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.230
to do.

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.740
And this was uncharted territory in many respects.

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:39.230
I certainly had never been involved in something
like this.

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:44.520
We had to be thinking constantly about what
we needed to do on the collection side; what

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:53.079
do we need to do in terms of informing policymakers,
coming up with options, informing Congress,

00:57:53.079 --> 00:57:56.099
what to say publicly?

00:57:56.099 --> 00:58:01.290
These were all things that we had to make
decisions about.

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:04.670
And I didn’t have a playbook for this.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:14.099
I had to deal with it based on my experience
and based on my counterintelligence experience.

00:58:14.099 --> 00:58:17.980
We were navigating shoals that I had never
encountered before.

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:23.470
And I must say, looking back on it, I think
we did a pretty good job of, again, working

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:30.589
with our partners, FBI and NSA and DNI, keeping
the White House informed and national security

00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:32.380
officials informed, as well as the Congress.

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:37.349
I very much hope that, as the Senate and the
House Intelligence Committees continue to

00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:45.329
do their work, that they will come up with
some legislation that will mandate certain

00:58:45.329 --> 00:58:49.850
things to happen prior to a presidential congressional
election.

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:54.270
For example, maybe coming out with a public
statement on the part of the director of national

00:58:54.270 --> 00:59:00.400
intelligence and director of FBI, 120 days
before such election, to let the American

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:07.040
people know what's the state of the electoral
system, what type of hacking efforts have

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.980
we seen.

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:14.349
And then maybe reserving for the congressional
leadership and the White House officials a

00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:19.060
classified briefing about the types of things
that we’re seeing so that there would be

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:26.910
a bit of a legislatedly mandated playbook,
so that the future intelligence and law enforcement

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:34.119
officials can really be able to deal with
this—such a situation in the future in the

00:59:34.119 --> 00:59:35.119
best way possible.

00:59:35.119 --> 00:59:38.940
MICHAEL KIRK - For those of us who are trying
to read tea leaves and connect dots from way

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:46.390
outside up in the atmosphere somewhere, it
looks early on in July and August, like the

00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:51.770
FBI hasn’t really signed on yet to the magnitude
that you're talking about.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:55.470
Even Clapper seems a little behind the curve.

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:59.420
We’re going to talk to him next week, so
we’ll hear his side of that.

00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:06.250
But I don’t see, from right away, a kind
of unanimity like you had.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.280
Was that your sense, too?

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:12.130
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, before I briefed the
president, and I had extended discussions

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:19.420
with individuals inside of CIA, inside of
CIA we have FBI agents who are working cheek-to-jowl

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.440
as part of the counterintelligence effort.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.920
These are people who really look at every
bit of information, every bit of data.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:35.160
I think that they had confidence, first, before
anybody, because they were swimming in the

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.160
data.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.770
Then, when I started to dip into it as well,
I became more confident.

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:46.430
That data, which was multifaceted, had to,
again, be protected.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.609
Then we started to bring others into it.

01:00:48.609 --> 01:00:55.640
And that’s why I decided, early on, that
having experienced the run-up to 9/11, where

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.570
data from one organization was not shared
with the others, and so intelligence dots

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:06.609
were not connected, I decided that we were
going to establish a fusion cell inside of

01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:10.820
CIA that was going to have NSA and FBI there,
and I wanted people to be able to share as

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.220
much as they could among each other.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:19.390
That fusion cell, that kept me very much informed
and was used to inform others.

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:25.980
Gradually, as more people became familiar
with the intelligence that we had, the understandings

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:31.750
that we had, the expertise that we had, the
experience of other Russian activities and

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:37.110
elections, I think that picture started to
emerge for many people.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:42.700
Over time there was greater confidence on
the part of those who might not have been

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.690
swimming in the data early on.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:49.339
But I saw that as growing over time.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:57.790
Certainly Jim Clapper and Jim Comey I think
were aligned, exactly aligned with me, as

01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:01.550
far as where we were in our estimates about
the Russian activities.

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:06.450
MICHAEL KIRK - So talk to me about Gen. Bortnikov,
the phone call.

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:10.940
This is a regularly scheduled phone call that
you would normally have anyway, but you decided,

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:13.410
with the president’s permission, to add
this to the agenda.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:22.180
JOHN BRENNAN - Over the course of my tenure
at CIA, I became, I guess, much closer or

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:26.700
had much more engagement with the head of
the FSB, Alexander Bortnikov, with basically

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:33.270
the head of their FBI, than I did with Mikhail
Fradkov, the head of the SVR, the CIA equivalent.

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:40.309
I did a lot with Bortnikov on counterterrorism
information, engaged with him quite a bit,

01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:41.990
met with him a number of times.

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:48.690
He, in fact, came to visit me at CIA headquarters,
and I had ongoing conversations with him about

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:52.849
what was going on in Afghanistan as well as
Syria.

01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:59.790
And so on Aug. 4, it was a scheduled call
that I had with Mr. Bortnikov, at his request,

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:03.710
to talk about the situation in Syria.

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:08.190
I said to myself first, and then to the White
House: “There's no way I can have a conversation

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:13.550
with Mr. Bortnikov at this time, given our
confidence level about what the Russians were

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:17.650
doing against our election, and not say a
word about it to him.

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:21.520
I just think that that would not have been
appropriate.”

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.840
So I spoke to the White House, and I said:
“I'm speaking to Mr. Bortnikov.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.260
We’re going to talk about Syria, but there
are two other things I want to talk to him

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.260
about.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:35.360
One is I want to make sure that I hit him
upside the head once again about some of the

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:44.530
harassing and even violent actions that the
FSB was responsible for in Russia, in Moscow

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:46.090
in particular, against U.S. diplomats.”

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:50.720
Time and time again, [then-Secretary of State]
John Kerry and I spoke about the need to push

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.880
the Russians on this issue of the regular
harassment that U.S. diplomats and families

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.760
faced in Moscow, so that was usually a part
of my ongoing talking points.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:06.160
But I also told the White House I wanted to
tell him about the Russian interference in

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.829
our election, and I said—because there were
a lot of things that were public at that time,

01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:14.780
I said, “I've been watching very carefully
all of these reports about Russian interference

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:15.849
in the election.”

01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:21.990
I told him that if they were doing this, this
would be a grave mistake; that it was going

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:29.760
to roil the relations between the United States
and Russia for many years to come; that all

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.359
Americans would be outraged over it, even
if the Russians were trying to advance the

01:04:34.359 --> 01:04:40.210
prospects of candidates that some Americans
were in favor of, because the American people

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:47.540
take very seriously the importance of the
integrity and the freedom of our election

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.720
system.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.420
Mr. Bortnikov denied it.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:58.890
I then came back to it and said, “This is
something that you need to take very seriously,”

01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.450
and he said he would relay it to Mr. Putin.

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:08.119
And I know that Mr. Bortnikov, who works very
closely with Mr. Putin, would relay that to

01:05:08.119 --> 01:05:12.720
him immediately, because in past conversations,
I asked Mr. Bortnikov to pass messages to

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:17.560
Mr. Putin, and I got a response within an
hour, so he would have immediate access to

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.309
him.

01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:21.869
Mr. Bortnikov promised to do that.

01:05:21.869 --> 01:05:26.240
I didn’t hear back from him with Mr. Putin’s
reaction and response.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.349
But Mr. Bortnikov said they’d be willing
to work with either candidate who emerged

01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:32.349
victorious in the election.

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:34.589
MICHAEL KIRK - But is it a surprise that you
didn’t hear back?

01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:35.910
That tells you something, doesn’t it?

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:36.910
JOHN BRENNAN - Yeah.

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:42.380
And when I spoke to him, I presumed he was
going to deny any interference.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:51.890
I presumed he was going to tell Mr. Putin,
but this was the first time that I think a

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.570
senior U.S. official confronted the Russians.

01:05:54.570 --> 01:06:01.030
And when the director of CIA says very clearly
to the director of the FSB, “Cut it out,”

01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:08.820
I think that that certainly has resonance
then in the Kremlin.

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:14.940
Then there were subsequent engagements between
the United States and Russia; President Obama

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.839
confronted Mr. Putin; and then there were
the public statements.

01:06:18.839 --> 01:06:26.750
I ask myself now, as a result of those direct
engagements with them, did it give the Russians

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.780
pause?

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.960
Did they decide not to do some of the things
that they could have done?

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.329
They continued to map the architecture of
the electoral infrastructure, looking at state

01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:36.859
systems.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.960
But we put them on notice.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.589
And did they then decide, “Hmm, let’s
not go all the way”?

01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:51.290
Yes, there were subsequent releases that we
saw from WikiLeaks, but some of the things

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:54.780
that they could have done they didn’t do.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:03.730
And there's a part of me that says, yeah,
those brushback pitches sent a clear signal

01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:10.579
to them, and I think they recognized that
this was a very important issue to the Obama

01:07:10.579 --> 01:07:13.380
administration.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:18.069
Maybe they didn’t have the same predictability
in terms of what our reaction would be.

01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:25.839
MICHAEL KIRK - Or appetite for whatever was
going to happen if they kept on staying at

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:27.760
the banquet.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:37.690
It’s late August through September, where
it feels like inside the White House, and

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:44.970
obviously you're involved in this, there's
a lot of talk about, so what should we do?

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:46.480
How should we respond?

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.410
… What was the range of —I don’t expect
you to be really, really specific, but what

01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:54.420
were the range of options available for the
president, and what did he finally decide

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:55.420
to do?

01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:01.109
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, the options looked at
a variety of paths.

01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:05.340
One is, what do you do, and what do you say
directly to the Russians?

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.500
That’s one.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:11.300
The second one is, what do you do and say
publicly, in terms of acknowledging to the

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.280
American people what is going on?

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:19.640
Third, what are some of the things that you
could do to try to rattle the Russians’

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:26.190
cage, maybe take some tangible steps, whether
it be symmetric or asymmetric?

01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:33.969
But then, I think overriding all of this was
the president—President Obama’s concern

01:08:33.969 --> 01:08:37.489
about not doing anything that was going to
become a self-fulfilling prophecy for the

01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:42.040
Russians, which was to call into question
the integrity of the election, particularly

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:49.290
since Mr. Trump quite blatantly said that
he was unsure if he was going to accept the

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:51.259
results of the election.

01:08:51.259 --> 01:08:55.960
He was asked by journalist newscasters, and
I think he said something like, “We’ll

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.960
see.”

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:03.319
So the president, as president of the United
States, but also as the head of the Democratic

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:10.839
Party, he insisted that we not do anything
that is going to, either in reality or in

01:09:10.839 --> 01:09:18.810
perception, be a thumb on the scale of the
November election.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:23.630
So we were very mindful of the responsibilities
to do everything possible to prevent the Russians

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:30.679
from being successful in what they were trying
to do, but at the same time not to do anything

01:09:30.679 --> 01:09:37.299
that is even going to call further into question
the integrity of the election, because I could

01:09:37.299 --> 01:09:42.270
view some scenarios where there would be this
escalating concern, and then people would

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:46.250
start to really wonder whether or not their
vote was going to count, and why would they

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.109
vote, whatever?

01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:52.299
It was a very, very delicate line to walk.

01:09:52.299 --> 01:10:01.230
CIA and the intelligence community, law enforcement,
FBI, I think we recognized that we needed

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:07.921
to be particularly careful in terms of not
doing anything that could cause there to be

01:10:07.921 --> 01:10:14.500
a greater disruption of the election.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:21.550
These were weighty decisions and long deliberations
and discussions, and we tossed things around.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:25.250
The statement that Jim Clapper and [then-Secretary
of Homeland Security] Jeh Johnson put out

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:31.090
went through an arduous review process, including
the White House Situation Room, just trying

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:34.730
to get the tone right, make sure the message
was right.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:41.130
Again, not having had a template that came
before us, we had to try to do the best we

01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:43.440
could.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:49.500
I think the president wanted to hear the full
range of options, which was the correct thing

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.670
to do, and we looked at what those options
were.

01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:58.880
We looked at the potential efficacy of them
as well as the potential disruptive impact,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:04.540
and I think the decisions that were made are
now history.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:19.110
MICHAEL KIRK - …During this month, the FBI,
at least the way the press reports it, has

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:27.260
uncovered in some way that the Russians are
also interested in the mechanics of the election.

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:33.420
That feels like something that's of a different
magnitude than propaganda or Infowars or whatever

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.880
it is, that this is really serious.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.650
Does it affect the debate inside the White
House in September and late August?

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:46.489
And in your own mind, does it change the magnitude
of how important this is, or did you already

01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:47.969
know that it was happening?

01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:56.750
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, the Russians will map
the architecture and the environment of their

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:57.750
targets.

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:01.610
It’s called operational preparation of the
environment, OPE.

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:07.611
They do it for military purposes so that they
understand exactly what they can do, so when

01:12:07.611 --> 01:12:16.230
we saw them starting to look at state electoral
systems, I think the sense was that this gives

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:25.860
them the opportunity to digest what those
systems look like and then to formulate options

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:29.940
or opportunities that they might be able to
take advantage of if they wanted to actually

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.120
do something against those voting electoral
systems.

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:40.420
That’s where it’s very important for the
Department of Homeland Security and the FBI

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:44.290
to understand what they were doing.

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:50.910
I had a number of conversations, including
one-on-ones with Jeh Johnson as he was doing

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:57.950
what he could to work with state officials
and to lend assistance to those who were trying

01:12:57.950 --> 01:13:01.340
to protect their electoral processes.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:05.910
MICHAEL KIRK - The way the story goes, he
calls lots of states.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:09.500
Many of them rebuff him, not interested.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.380
Keep the federal government out of our election
problem, whatever they say.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.719
Is that a surprise to you?

01:13:14.719 --> 01:13:16.340
JOHN BRENNAN - No.

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:21.070
I think we understood that there was going
to be some resistance on the part of states.

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:22.489
Again, I didn’t deal with any of the states.

01:13:22.489 --> 01:13:24.440
That’s not CIA’s mandate.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:33.110
I sought, in two ways, one gets back to the
Hamilton-Jefferson division about states’

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:35.000
rights and national rights.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.340
Secondly, some of those states were concerned
not just about the federal government’s

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:47.850
interference in what they see as an inalienable
right of states, but also partisan politics

01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:52.860
I think started to swirl about, and wondering
whether or not an administration that is a

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:59.150
Democratic administration trying to come into
states’ voting systems, electoral systems,

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:00.960
whether there could be something up with that.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:06.070
MICHAEL KIRK - Was Johnson free to tell them
the magnitude of what the worry was?

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:11.880
JOHN BRENNAN - Jeh Johnson tried to be as
clear as possible about the nature of the

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.199
threat and the risks that were out there.

01:14:15.199 --> 01:14:21.190
But also, there was just so much in the public
domain at that point that anybody who thought

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:25.920
that the Russians were not actively involved
in trying to interfere in the election was

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.110
not reading the paper, watching television,
or using their common sense.

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:35.330
MICHAEL KIRK - Well, the way the story goes,
you had had a similar experience up with Congress

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:44.590
in your initial trek up there to talk to Gang
of Eight and others, that you were met with

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:47.360
some partisan response and even serious doubt.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.360
…

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.330
JOHN BRENNAN - In those briefings of Congress,
some of the individuals expressed concern

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:59.380
that this was motivated by partisan interests
on the part of the administration.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:08.290
I took offense to that and told them that
this is an intelligence assessment; this is

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:13.070
an intelligence matter, and I wanted to make
sure that they were informed, because the

01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:19.110
Gang of Eight responsibilities required them
to take this seriously.

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:28.440
I told them that this in no way reflected
any type of partisan effort, so they understood

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.340
that I was serious about it, certainly.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.630
MICHAEL KIRK - Even after you shared the intelligence?

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:37.179
JOHN BRENNAN - I shared the intelligence with
the—yes.

01:15:37.179 --> 01:15:41.699
MICHAEL KIRK - So even after that, they still
think of it as a partisan issue?

01:15:41.699 --> 01:15:49.679
JOHN BRENNAN - Even though I had served in
intelligence for several decades, I think

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:54.910
some people still saw me as the CIA director
appointed by a Democratic president, even

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:59.380
though I had served six presidents, three
Democrat, three Republican.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:04.440
I reminded some of that fact that I take this
very seriously.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:09.630
I take my responsibilities seriously, and
I am very concerned about what the Russians

01:16:09.630 --> 01:16:11.030
are doing with the election.

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:17.040
MICHAEL KIRK - You talked about the Oct. 7
release of Mr. Clapper’s—the DNI’s report,

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.150
the three or four paragraphs.

01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:24.440
There was once a paragraph about Putin specifically
that gets dropped by the time it’s publicly

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.440
issued.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.440
Do you know why?

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:32.060
JOHN BRENNAN - We wanted to make sure that
the statement that came out was going to reflect

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:38.170
as accurately as possible what it is that
we knew and what we assessed, but at the same

01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:43.810
time to make sure that we were able to protect
sources and methods.

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:47.880
There were decisions made in terms of what
should be included and what should not be

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:54.450
included, that reflected those dual concerns:
[be] accurate, but at the same time protect

01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:55.450
sources and methods.

01:16:55.450 --> 01:17:01.080
MICHAEL KIRK - So you were worried about a
source in some way, or a method in some way,

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.719
being revealed if you tagged Putin with it.

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:12.920
JOHN BRENNAN - I think the editing of that
statement reflected a shared interest in being

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:18.820
as forthcoming as possible while at the same
time not jeopardizing our ability to continue

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:21.330
to have insight into what the Russians might
be doing.

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.130
MICHAEL KIRK - What a day that was.

01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:27.890
You know, that statement comes out at 3:30
in the afternoon, and within a half hour,

01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:32.510
the Access Hollywood crude remarks from the
president appear.

01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:40.560
And a half hour after that, there's a WikiLeaks
dump of the John Podesta emails.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.080
What was happening that day for you, when
it went out, and then you watched all of that

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.489
follow on?

01:17:46.489 --> 01:17:52.300
JOHN BRENNAN - The run-up to the election,
it seemed like every day there was breaking

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.520
news.

01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:00.670
And yes, I was mindful of the other things
that were happening on that day, but as intelligence

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:06.350
professionals, as the head of the CIA, needed
to make sure that you keep a trained eye on

01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:09.050
what it is that you need to do.

01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:12.630
Russian interference in the election was not
the only issue I was dealing with.

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:17.330
I was dealing with a lot of other things on
the terrorism front and the Middle East front,

01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:18.330
North Korea.

01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:22.949
It’s just in some respects a typical day,
where there are a lot of things on the intelligence-national

01:18:22.949 --> 01:18:24.010
security front that are burning.

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:28.780
But, at the same time, there are a lot of
other things that are maybe on the sidelines

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:33.940
that distract the attention and focus of some
people from some of those national security

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:34.940
matters.

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:40.969
But I must say that I really felt that the
National Security Council of the Obama administration,

01:18:40.969 --> 01:18:46.140
at the highest levels, remained fixated on
this issue of Russian interference in the

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.420
election, irrespective of the other news that
might be coming out.

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.420
MICHAEL KIRK - … The other event that happens
in September, of course, the president goes

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:57.010
to the G-20 and pulls President Putin aside.

01:18:57.010 --> 01:19:04.040
Obviously you were part of the briefing of
the president, of all the dimensions of all

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.690
the things he’d have to talk to Putin about
if the occasion presented itself.

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.940
What happened there?

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:17.530
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, I think a picture tells
a thousand words.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:24.800
When you look at the image of Mr. Putin and
President Obama on the sidelines of that summit,

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:33.070
I think President Obama’s face really conveys
a sense of deep concern and sending a message

01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:35.660
to Mr. Putin.

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:42.160
We had talked about the importance of making
sure that President Obama seized that opportunity

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.460
so that Mr. Putin had no misunderstanding
whatsoever.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:51.441
We were confident that Mr. Bortnikov relayed
the information that I did to Mr. Putin, but

01:19:51.441 --> 01:19:56.860
similarly, just the way I didn’t want to
pass up an opportunity with occasion with

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:01.440
Bortnikov, I think the president wanted to
make sure that Mr. Putin understood the gravity

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:09.460
of this, the seriousness with which President
Obama viewed it, and the need to cease and

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.460
desist.

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:13.250
MICHAEL KIRK - … On Oct. 7, when the statement
is finally released, there's been a lot of

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.860
talk and back-and-forth about the American
people need to know.

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:18.080
They need to know something, some details.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.180
They need to know that you guys are all in
agreement about it.

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:29.610
And at that moment, there it is, finally the
release, the justification, and it gets subsumed

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:38.190
and carried into the vortex of the Donald
Trump—let’s not even characterize—crude

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:41.230
behavior tape.

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:46.040
Big loss from your point of view that it was
sort of taken over by that event?

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:53.390
JOHN BRENNAN - You know, you can never predict
what's going to happen when you release something

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:54.390
like that.

01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:58.670
The news of the day continues to unfold.

01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:05.030
We wanted to make sure we got it out as quickly
as we could after the deliberation took place.

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:13.010
And whether or not people took it seriously,
by then all the press, the media were covering

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:17.230
the interference in the election, there was
a debate back and forth about whether or not

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:20.420
it was needed or necessary to go out with
a statement like that.

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.560
Or should it be harder-hitting or less, or
whatever?

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.570
MICHAEL KIRK - There was a lot of back-and-forth
about the statement and about how strong the

01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:29.570
statement should be.

01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:32.540
JOHN BRENNAN - Once we decided on the language
of the statement, we wanted to make sure we

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:37.239
were able to get it out quickly, so it was
released.

01:21:37.239 --> 01:21:41.040
We knew that it was going to get pickup in
the media, obviously.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:45.780
People were anticipating, I think, that the
administration was going to be saying something

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.050
publicly.

01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:53.390
But then, when it was—it seemed to be overtaken,
in some respects, by the video and the audio

01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:59.240
of Mr. Trump’s comments, it—I don’t
know.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:04.510
I don’t want to say it was disappointing,
but it is a fact of life.

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:07.320
That’s what happens in—certainly in Washington.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:11.940
You can never predict what other newsworthy
stories are going to be coming out at a time

01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.900
when you release a statement.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:20.880
But I think by then we were all convinced
that the American people were aware of this

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.030
Russian interference.

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:30.050
But we thought it was very, very important
to get on the record that this was certainly

01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:34.679
the considered judgment—in fact, unanimous
judgment about those activities.

01:22:34.679 --> 01:22:39.440
MICHAEL KIRK - It also felt to me, feels to
me as I look back on it, like the White House

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:47.420
had pretty much decided, by Oct. 7: “Look,
we’ll deal with this after the election.

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:53.210
Whatever we do, however forcefully we respond,
that response will follow Hillary Clinton’s

01:22:53.210 --> 01:22:58.480
election,” because almost everybody believed
that Hillary Clinton was going to win.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:02.870
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, in the run-up to the
election, I think the president always felt

01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:07.690
as though, if he needed to take more aggressive
action against Russia, he could.

01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:14.130
And he saw that there was going to be opportunities
before to do something if necessary, but as

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:17.540
well afterward.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:26.300
It was, I think, determined that we didn’t
want to get into an escalatory cyber battle

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:31.250
with the Russians, because there were options
that were considered, as far as the things

01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:33.650
that we could do in the cyber realm.

01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:40.360
But there is a question about, then, what
would the Russians have done to counter that,

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:49.300
and if they were going to counter it, how
that could have further interfered in the

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.670
election or undermined the credibility.

01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:54.860
MICHAEL KIRK - Is that in the realm of what
we were worried about, about the states and

01:23:54.860 --> 01:24:03.010
about getting actually inside the process,
the technical, the vote-gathering process?

01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:04.050
JOHN BRENNAN - Yeah.

01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:10.190
By October, the middle of October, we were
aware of what Russia was trying to do vis-à-vis

01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:13.199
the state systems.

01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:18.180
We knew that there were capabilities that
the Russians could have exercised, that would

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:21.262
have raised even greater questions about the
credibility and integrity of the election.

01:24:21.262 --> 01:24:27.100
What we didn’t want to do was to take some
type of action that would have negligible

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:36.429
or marginal impact on the Russians, but yet
trigger some type of Russian counteraction,

01:24:36.429 --> 01:24:43.390
which would have I think been quite disruptive
of the electoral system, and I think raised

01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:47.510
questions about the validity of the outcome.

01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:53.400
At this time, as everybody was watching the
polls, I think everybody was pretty convinced

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.340
that Hillary Clinton was going to win the
election.

01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:01.100
I think the Russians were convinced of that,
[as were] I think most political observers,

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:06.550
as well as officials in Washington.

01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:12.650
Looking back on it now, when I think if people
in Washington and the White House felt that

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:14.710
there was a closer race, would they have done
things differently?

01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:16.770
I don’t know.

01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:22.460
That’s something that I think President
Obama would have to answer.

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:31.650
I do think that the president tried to do
it in a manner that was going to be as unbiased

01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:34.820
and least disruptive as possible.

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:40.170
When I saw the options that were available,
even if he thought that Mr. Trump was going

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:48.230
to emerge the winner, I don’t think the
president would have opted for any of the

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:54.900
scenarios that would have involved a U.S.
cyber response against Russia prior to the

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.900
election.

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:56.900
I just don’t think he would have done it.

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.570
MICHAEL KIRK - Were all of you who held things
fairly closely and were getting lots of different

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:07.010
kinds of intelligence, were you also aware
of the appearance of collusion by the Trump

01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:17.940
family, by [Jared] Kushner, by young Don Jr.,
the Russian banker, the Russian lawyer, the

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:25.400
other things that seemed to be going on, Roger
Stone talking to Guccifer, and saying, you

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.110
know, “Watch out, Podesta is next”?

01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:30.850
All of that, were you in on all of that as
well?

01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:40.659
JOHN BRENNAN - There were things that happened,
meetings that took place between individuals

01:26:40.659 --> 01:26:54.090
on the Russian side and on the U.S. side that
raised my concerns about collaboration related

01:26:54.090 --> 01:26:55.630
to the election.

01:26:55.630 --> 01:27:03.010
I didn’t know what was motivating some people,
but I certainly was concerned.

01:27:03.010 --> 01:27:07.900
And anything that we had that involved U.S.
persons, anything that the CIA collected or

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.840
had information about involving U.S. persons,
we immediately shared it with the FBI, because

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.340
it’s their responsibility to pull those
investigative threads.

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:22.480
So I was aware, contemporaneously, of some
things that were going on, which again caused

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.280
me to furrow my brow and say, “What's this
all about?”

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:30.510
But I didn’t follow it up.

01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:33.110
I was confident that the FBI would be able
to do its job.

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:37.469
MICHAEL KIRK - Were there things that we don’t—did
you know things, and do you know things that

01:27:37.469 --> 01:27:38.800
we didn’t know?

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.360
JOHN BRENNAN - CIA director always knows things
that others don’t know.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.360
MICHAEL KIRK - So there were more of these
events than we know now?

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:56.570
JOHN BRENNAN - Anything that we uncovered,
that was relevant to the election and Russian

01:27:56.570 --> 01:28:03.270
interference, and anything especially that
involved U.S. persons or individuals associated

01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:09.020
with the Trump campaign, that information
was made available to the FBI.

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:12.179
And it was FBI’s job then to follow up on
it.

01:28:12.179 --> 01:28:18.340
A lot of those investigative leads, if you
will, I don’t know what happened as a result,

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:22.120
because that’s the FBI’s responsibility
and not CIA’s responsibility.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:28.650
MICHAEL KIRK - OK, so when we get to the day
of the election, what are you worrying about

01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:33.080
as the head of the Central Intelligence Agency
and the guy who’s read in on basically everything

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.080
that’s happening?

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.199
What are you watching for?

01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:36.199
What are you worried about?

01:28:36.199 --> 01:28:40.250
I'm not talking about in winners and losers,
but the process.

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:48.560
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, in the days before the
election, there was constant interaction between

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.950
the experts at CIA, FBI and NSA, making sure
that we shared with each other the latest

01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:59.890
insight into what might be happening and what
the Russians might be doing.

01:28:59.890 --> 01:29:06.980
We were monitoring and using our collection
capabilities to understand what the Russians

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:10.730
might have up their sleeve at the 11th hour.

01:29:10.730 --> 01:29:19.719
I was kept informed by my people, and we were
very focused on making sure that any indicator

01:29:19.719 --> 01:29:26.610
of some type of disruptive activity on Election
Day was going to be uncovered, and therefore—and

01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:28.970
consequently shared.

01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:34.520
Again, in the life of a CIA director, you
have a dozen things that you're focusing on,

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:40.460
because the world doesn’t allow you just
to focus on one, so I was confident that my

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:45.510
people would tell me if we saw anything that
the Russians might be doing on Election Day.

01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:51.199
MICHAEL KIRK - Was there any one single thing,
the hacking of the states, something like

01:29:51.199 --> 01:29:57.070
that, that really concerned you as we got
up to the zero hour?

01:29:57.070 --> 01:30:05.020
JOHN BRENNAN - There were concerns about could
the Russians do something with the voter registration

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:10.610
rolls, make names disappear, replace some
things, and prevent some people from voting?

01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:14.690
Didn’t have to be the vote tallies itself.

01:30:14.690 --> 01:30:20.540
I was, as I was watching some of the returns
come in, I know that some of those returns

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:26.610
are sent from the precincts to the state centers,
and they're sent over the Internet.

01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:32.510
Is there going to be some type of action that
the Russians might take to prevent those tallies

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:35.650
from being delivered?

01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:41.320
I didn’t know if the Russians were going
to do anything at all.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:51.300
I thought if they did that, it clearly would
be a sign that Putin had authorized an exceptionally,

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:57.380
an unprecedented, aggressive assault against
this country that to me would have been tantamount

01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:06.199
to war, actually doing something against the
voters or the votes on Election Day.

01:31:06.199 --> 01:31:13.160
So I was wondering whether or not we’d see
that.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.320
MICHAEL KIRK - We’ve talked to lots of people
in Russia about what it was like in Moscow

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.860
that day, what Putin’s response was.

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:26.150
What was your response, Mr. Brennan, to the
election results?

01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:36.980
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, speaking as an individual
U.S. citizen, U.S. voter, I was surprised

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.230
at the election results.

01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:46.360
But then, you know, it's a momentary bit of
surprise, and then we kick in, as we always

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:50.409
do, to make sure that we fulfill our responsibilities.

01:31:50.409 --> 01:31:58.000
I was then-President-elect Obama’s lead
for the intelligence transition from the Bush

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:05.210
administration to the Obama administration,
and I was so, so impressed by just what a

01:32:05.210 --> 01:32:10.250
great job the Bush administration did in terms
of welcoming us and making sure we were as

01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:16.870
well prepared as possible when the Obama administration
took over reins of government in January of

01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:17.870
2009.

01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:23.719
President Obama had previously told us that
he wanted our transition effort to be as good,

01:32:23.719 --> 01:32:27.040
if not better, as the Bush team.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:34.530
So we had already worked up some things to
provide to the new incoming team, and the

01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:39.580
day after election met with the folks and
said, “OK, let’s be ready to give the

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:44.739
individuals who are going to be anointed as
the part of the new administration the briefings

01:32:44.739 --> 01:32:47.620
that they needed, so at the meetings.”

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:54.170
We had some of our best people pull together
materials, books, briefings for that.

01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:58.110
And we waited, and we waited, and we waited.

01:32:58.110 --> 01:33:05.510
No one really came knocking at our door, which
concerned me, because I knew that this was

01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:10.870
going to be an enormous, enormous climb for
the Trump team, because I really felt that

01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:15.580
they were probably more surprised than anybody
that they were elected.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.440
They were ill prepared for it.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.620
They were not ready.

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:29.920
There was very, very sparse and limited interaction
between the incoming team and the outgoing

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.360
team, particularly on the intelligence front.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:37.440
All the materials, all the briefings, all
the readiness that we had trying to emulate

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:46.450
what the Bush administration did to such a
great extent, it really was not utilized by

01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:53.840
the new team, which was disappointing, because
I understand just how complex the role is

01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:00.041
for the incoming team, and how complex and
complicated and dangerous the world is, so

01:34:00.041 --> 01:34:05.540
I was very concerned that they were going
to take over on the 20th of January without

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.700
the preparation that was needed.

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:10.469
And I think that’s exactly what happened.

01:34:10.469 --> 01:34:20.239
MICHAEL KIRK - Did you, in the immediate aftermath
of Trump’s victory, worry that something

01:34:20.239 --> 01:34:26.850
untoward had happened to give him the victory?

01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:37.560
JOHN BRENNAN - I was very concerned that Mr.
Trump was, again, ill prepared for the job;

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:48.630
that he didn’t have a good grasp of international
affairs, the domestic policy scene, the legislative

01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:52.820
process, U.S. law, intelligence capabilities.

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:59.330
I had already engaged in some back-and-forth
publicly with Mr. Trump because of his disparaging

01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:01.710
remarks about the intelligence community.

01:35:01.710 --> 01:35:07.239
… I was very much hoping and believing that
Mr. Trump was going to learn on the job and

01:35:07.239 --> 01:35:08.810
grow into the position.

01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:16.659
But then, a couple days after he was inaugurated,
he showed up at CIA headquarters, and in front

01:35:16.659 --> 01:35:28.210
of our hallowed Memorial Wall, started to
talk politics, which I thought was very inappropriate

01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:29.980
and disgraceful in many ways.

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:39.090
So yes, I was very concerned that we were
going to be in for a different type of administration,

01:35:39.090 --> 01:35:43.199
a different type of presidency.

01:35:43.199 --> 01:35:48.990
Maybe I was spoiled by the eight years of
President Obama, who I thought had the utmost

01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:56.610
integrity, utmost decency, as far as how he
treated other people, and also a tremendous

01:35:56.610 --> 01:36:04.249
intellect and understanding of the world and
our Constitution and our laws.

01:36:04.249 --> 01:36:09.550
… But I will say that, you know, I have
talked with many people in the Obama administration.

01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:13.260
We want the administration, the Trump administration,
to succeed.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.760
We want this president to be successful.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.719
We want this country to be strong.

01:36:19.719 --> 01:36:23.570
But I must say that our institutions of governance
are being tested.

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:30.880
And Mr. Trump still doesn’t, in my view,
understand the solemn, the sacred obligations

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.040
of being president of the United States.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:41.679
It’s not all about him; it’s about this
country, and he needs to, I think, adjust

01:36:41.679 --> 01:36:47.960
his mindset if he’s going to do what he
needs to do for the American people.

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:54.650
MICHAEL KIRK - Let me go back one more thought
about the Election Day, post-Election Day.

01:36:54.650 --> 01:37:04.010
Did you believe, as a law enforcement, as
a national security expert, do you believe

01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:14.030
there was any possibility that the Trump team
colluded with the Russians on the election

01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:15.030
results?

01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:20.550
JOHN BRENNAN - I don’t know whether or not
there was any collaboration, collusion or

01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:28.670
conspiracy that took place between U.S. persons
and Russians related to the election, and

01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:35.150
I think it would be unfair for me to speculate
about individuals doing that.

01:37:35.150 --> 01:37:44.050
But I will say there were things that were
taking place that I believe required the FBI

01:37:44.050 --> 01:37:53.100
to investigate, to ensure that there was no
such collusion, collaboration or conspiracy

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.880
between U.S. persons, including those associated
with the campaign, and Russia.

01:37:58.880 --> 01:37:59.949
The American people deserve to know.

01:37:59.949 --> 01:38:02.060
MICHAEL KIRK - Do you think they're investigating
those things?

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:09.280
JOHN BRENNAN - I have great confidence in
the FBI’s ability to carry out these investigations,

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:17.540
and they are particularly adept and adroit
at pulling threads, especially on the financial

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:18.540
front.

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:23.370
I've been involved in many counterterrorism
investigations and counterintelligence investigations

01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:31.969
over the years, and pulling on those financial
threads frequently reveals very interesting

01:38:31.969 --> 01:38:38.340
relationships and acts of a criminal nature.

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:45.199
That’s what the FBI’s job is, and that’s
what they're very adroit at doing.

01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:46.949
So I have great confidence in their abilities.

01:38:46.949 --> 01:38:52.330
MICHAEL KIRK - During that period, from the
end of the thing until—from the Election

01:38:52.330 --> 01:38:59.340
Day to Thanksgiving, the way people in the
White House tell us, they were sort of reeling.

01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:06.290
But there was a sort of sense from the president,
“Let’s get all the ducks in a row about

01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:11.330
what to do about the hacking, about what to
do about Russia, about what the signals are.”

01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:14.750
We’ve heard John Kerry’s position.

01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:16.449
We’ve heard others’ positions.

01:39:16.449 --> 01:39:17.540
“Let’s get really strong.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.980
Let’s go after these guys.

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.690
Let’s punish them.

01:39:20.690 --> 01:39:22.870
Let’s release his bank accounts.”

01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:25.920
Let’s do whatever the thoughts were at the
time.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:33.410
It eventually comes down to, on the 29th of
December, the sanctions, the expelling of

01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:39.090
35 people, and the seizing or whatever of
the two houses as announced by the president

01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:43.280
from Hawaii.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:44.280
Were they strong enough?

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:49.180
Were those sanctions strong enough, given
the magnitude of the incursion and the crime?

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:55.219
JOHN BRENNAN - You know, those 10 weeks between
Election Day and Inauguration Day go very

01:39:55.219 --> 01:39:56.219
quickly.

01:39:56.219 --> 01:39:59.340
There's just a lot to do.

01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:02.610
The president and others wanted to make sure
that we were able to take some actions against

01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:04.489
the Russians.

01:40:04.489 --> 01:40:07.600
This was long in coming, because we wanted
to take actions against the Russians for a

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:14.659
lot of their harassment of U.S. officials,
so this was sort of a culmination of concerns

01:40:14.659 --> 01:40:17.400
along those lines.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.989
We knew that we were going to be out of office
on the 20th of January, and we knew that the

01:40:23.989 --> 01:40:29.830
next administration, the Trump administration
could undo some of the things that we did.

01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:36.239
The White House I think was keeping the Trump
team informed about the steps that we were

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:41.949
considering, ongoing engagements with their
team.

01:40:41.949 --> 01:40:43.830
Were they strong enough?

01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:47.719
I don’t know.

01:40:47.719 --> 01:40:54.219
For things that would have been much more
strategic in impact and broader in scope,

01:40:54.219 --> 01:41:00.400
I think would have taken longer to implement
and would have required the incoming team

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.970
to continue that effort, and we were very
uncertain whether or not the incoming team

01:41:05.970 --> 01:41:07.840
would do that.

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.650
There was focus on what it is that we could
do in the short term that was going to send

01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:15.739
a clear signal, going to hurt.

01:41:15.739 --> 01:41:20.550
I can remember vividly the discussions that
we had in the Situation Room about how many

01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:24.450
Russian intelligence officers should be PNG’d
[persona non grata’d] and whether it should

01:41:24.450 --> 01:41:28.400
be just a small number or a larger number
or whatever.

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:36.300
There was a pretty strong consensus that we
wanted to do as much as we could, because

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:39.030
it was the right thing to do.

01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:41.380
And we didn’t know what the Trump administration
was going to do.

01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:46.330
Again, we were still puzzled by a lot of the
comments that Mr. Trump and others were making

01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:47.330
about Russia.

01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:50.739
They didn’t seem to be taking this concern
seriously.

01:41:50.739 --> 01:41:58.410
They didn’t seem to want to understand a
lot of the details of what it is that we knew,

01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:04.000
and they were a bit dismissive of the conclusions.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.110
We knew that we had to take action, so we
said, “Well, this is what is appropriate

01:42:10.110 --> 01:42:11.739
now.”

01:42:11.739 --> 01:42:18.010
One of the things that I think we took some
comfort in was we had a lot of engagement

01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:19.680
with the Congress during this period of time.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:25.239
I had a number of calls from senior members
of Congress who wanted to ensure that we did

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:29.160
everything possible, first of all, to preserve
the information on the intelligence that we

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:38.430
had about the interference, because they wanted
to take up this mantle in the new year.

01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:45.909
I said to a number of them that the institutions
of governance are really going to require

01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:51.320
the Congress and the congressional committees
to do what is right here.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:54.290
I said: “I don’t know what the Trump administration
is going to do when they come in.”

01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:59.670
I said: “I have my concerns about some of
the attitudes toward Russia and Mr. Putin.

01:42:59.670 --> 01:43:04.760
But I have confidence, even with all my battles
with Congress over the years, this is what

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:10.280
Congress, as a co-equal branch of government,
really has an obligation to do: Do what is

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:16.080
right for the American people, irrespective
of political party affiliation, irrespective

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:22.780
of the views of an individual who happens
to be inhabiting the Oval Office.”

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:30.470
So in my conversations with members of Congress
from both sides of the aisle, I had growing

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:35.700
confidence that this was not going to end
with the end of the Obama administration,

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.700
that this was going to continue.

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:43.080
And I knew that Jim Comey was not going to
be out of office on Jan. 20.

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:52.920
I have tremendous respect for Jim Comey, and
I knew that the FBI was going to do its work

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.190
so that this would not be covered up.

01:43:57.190 --> 01:44:04.720
I think we see now, many months afterward,
this continues to percolate.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:11.190
The American people deserve answers, and Congress,
the FBI, Department of Justice will get us

01:44:11.190 --> 01:44:18.520
those answers, whether or not Mr. Trump wants
to hear those answers or deal with them or

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.520
not.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.100
MICHAEL KIRK - The president makes the announcement
from Hawaii on the 29th.

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:28.280
Were you sort of holding your breath about
which one of the people who worked for you,

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:34.340
or how many people you worked for, were about
to be expelled from Russia, or worse?

01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:44.550
JOHN BRENNAN - I voted—well, I was very
supportive of throwing out as many Russians,

01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:52.260
even more if we could, as possible, because
I came to know what the Russians are up to,

01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:59.120
and I wanted as many Russian intelligence
officers out of this country as possible.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:06.280
There were people in CIA who were concerned
about that and advocated for fewer, because

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:11.520
they were concerned that there was going to
be retaliatory steps taken against our diplomats

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:14.330
in Moscow.

01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:24.090
I was of the view that the Russians were not
going to retaliate in kind.

01:45:24.090 --> 01:45:31.540
It was based on my assessment that they were
looking forward to the Trump administration

01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:39.659
taking over in Washington and that they didn’t
want to take these actions that would be disruptive

01:45:39.659 --> 01:45:45.580
in their minds, because they, I think, had
great hopes for a rapprochement of sorts between

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:48.870
Moscow and Washington come Jan 20.

01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:56.219
MICHAEL KIRK - Little did you know that from
the Dominican Republic beach, Mike Flynn is

01:45:56.219 --> 01:46:02.500
making a call to Ambassador [Sergey] Kislyak,
assuring him of that actual fact, that he

01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:07.390
didn’t have to worry about the sanctions
and that Mr. Putin should hold his fire.

01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:16.330
JOHN BRENNAN - Again, I was not encouraged
by what I was seeing and hearing from the

01:46:16.330 --> 01:46:21.810
Trump team about their views toward Russia.

01:46:21.810 --> 01:46:29.489
I was not of a mind that they were going to
follow through with additional pressure on

01:46:29.489 --> 01:46:32.750
Russia once they came into office, and I think
that was borne out by the facts.

01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:37.940
MICHAEL KIRK - … We have to talk about the
Trump Tower meeting, where you guys go and

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:46.150
talk to the president-elect, show him the
evidence, talk to him, talk turkey to him

01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:47.500
about what it really was.

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:49.030
Can you take me there?

01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:53.400
Talk about at least what you were trying to
convey, and how that went.

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.760
JOHN BRENNAN - We had a meeting with Mr. Trump
at Trump Tower.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.890
It was several hours long.

01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:02.630
We talked to him about what it is that we
knew and assessed.

01:47:02.630 --> 01:47:09.530
We talked about what the Russian objectives
were, what the capabilities are.

01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:11.960
It was a back-and-forth.

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.730
But I'm not going to get into details of that
meeting.

01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:17.900
MICHAEL KIRK - Can you tell me how he was?

01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:19.659
What was he like when you went in?

01:47:19.659 --> 01:47:21.489
Was he different when it was over?

01:47:21.489 --> 01:47:26.220
JOHN BRENNAN - Mr. Trump was gracious.

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.520
He welcomed us.

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:32.630
He thanked us for our service.

01:47:32.630 --> 01:47:34.340
He listened.

01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:39.179
I would say that his graciousness and his
demeanor did not change from the beginning

01:47:39.179 --> 01:47:42.179
to the end of the conversation.

01:47:42.179 --> 01:47:50.460
So he was—I think he was at home in the
Trump Tower, and just, you know—he listened,

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.510
because I think he felt as though he should.

01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:56.239
MICHAEL KIRK - But you don’t feel you changed
his mind?

01:47:56.239 --> 01:48:02.010
JOHN BRENNAN - From his public comments that
he made before the meeting at Trump Tower

01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:08.580
to the comments he made subsequent to that
briefing, I don’t think he changed his mind,

01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:15.500
or at least he didn’t change his public
attitude and his statements.

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:22.270
What he says publicly, which tends to be rather
skeptical of the intelligence, and what he

01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:25.370
believes in his heart of hearts may be two
very different things.

01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:30.230
I think sometimes he talks because he feels
as though he has to say certain things in

01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:36.300
order to appeal to maybe his base or to others,
but I don’t know what he truly believes,

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.520
or if he is truly dismissive of the intelligence.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:49.699
But he is obviously a rather deft politician,
who continues to do and say and tweet things

01:48:49.699 --> 01:48:58.250
because he believes that that’s a way to
convey messages that he wants conveyed to

01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:59.250
the American people.

01:48:59.250 --> 01:49:00.930
MICHAEL KIRK - Did you give him the full monty?

01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:05.130
Was it all that everything was at the hard
stuff?

01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:12.330
JOHN BRENNAN - We provided to him the briefing
that, as president-elect, he deserved to get.

01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:15.139
MICHAEL KIRK - Yeah?

01:49:15.139 --> 01:49:16.139
What does that mean?

01:49:16.139 --> 01:49:21.270
JOHN BRENNAN - It means there were a number
of other people in that room, so it wasn’t

01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:23.119
just the president-elect.

01:49:23.119 --> 01:49:31.340
There was members of his team, so therefore,
I had to take that into account.

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:33.160
MICHAEL KIRK - I see.

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:44.610
JOHN BRENNAN - And I made sure that he understood
the strength of our confidence in our assessments.

01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:51.790
But again, I was mindful of the environment
and the people there.

01:49:51.790 --> 01:50:02.760
But he should have come away with a very clear
understanding of just where James Clapper,

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.699
Jim Comey, Mike Rogers and John Brennan came
out on these issues.

01:50:06.699 --> 01:50:15.369
There was no equivocation in our language,
and we were very direct and very, very clear

01:50:15.369 --> 01:50:18.159
in terms of what it is that we knew and assessed.

01:50:18.159 --> 01:50:23.719
MICHAEL KIRK - Of course Comey privately gives
him the Steele dossier information or talks

01:50:23.719 --> 01:50:27.780
about it or shows it to him.

01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:30.179
You obviously have seen the Steele dossier.

01:50:30.179 --> 01:50:32.830
What do you make of it?

01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:39.260
JOHN BRENNAN - The Intelligence Community
assessment did not take into account anything

01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:43.610
that was included in that dossier.

01:50:43.610 --> 01:50:47.800
That dossier had been circulating for quite
some time.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:54.030
It was certainly not a secret among Washington
journalists and reporters, but it was still

01:50:54.030 --> 01:51:00.650
unclear to us, and I think to Jim Comey, about
how much the president-elect was aware of

01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:01.650
this.

01:51:01.650 --> 01:51:10.739
Again, I defer to Jim Comey to explain and
describe exactly what he did in terms of any

01:51:10.739 --> 01:51:12.639
discussions he might have had with the president-elect.

01:51:12.639 --> 01:51:18.220
MICHAEL KIRK - … So we started with Vladimir
Putin in Ukraine.

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.830
We went backward to Vladimir Putin as a KGB
officer in Dresden.

01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:28.739
We watched him grow up and become a man who,
out of a sense of grievance and probably revenge,

01:51:28.739 --> 01:51:36.070
exercises the full power of his office, apparently
to muck around in the American election.

01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:37.190
Why did he do it?

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:39.600
In your mind, why did he do that?

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:47.460
JOHN BRENNAN - I think he interfered in the
election because he could, and because he

01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:55.550
was determined to hurt Hillary Clinton, who
he believed was going to become president.

01:51:55.550 --> 01:52:05.679
I believe he wanted her to be inaugurated
at a time when she was going to be bloodied

01:52:05.679 --> 01:52:11.030
a bit by these exposures.

01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:17.760
I do think that he probably had other things
planned, as far as if she were elected, both

01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:20.630
before the inauguration and afterward.

01:52:20.630 --> 01:52:26.040
One of his principal objectives has been to
drive a wedge between the United States and

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:34.240
Europe as a way to get sanctions relief, because
those sanctions are hurting the Russian economy,

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:39.050
and it’s one of Mr. Putin’s highest priorities.

01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:46.719
I do believe that he was going to try to use
Russian intelligence services to further sow

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:55.420
suspicion between European capitals and Washington
under a Hillary Clinton presidency, and I

01:52:55.420 --> 01:53:00.830
am pretty confident that the Russians probably
had a few things up their sleeves that would

01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:05.860
be used to try to discredit the Clinton presidency.

01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:10.460
Again, he sees things in zero-sum fashion.

01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:15.869
If the U.S. president or the U.S. is diminished
in the eyes of the world in any way, or it’s

01:53:15.869 --> 01:53:18.360
hurt, it just benefits Russia.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:24.820
That’s why, when I think about how Mr. Putin
feels now about developments in the United

01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:31.139
States, when he sees that Mr. Trump has been
hobbled in many respects by this investigation,

01:53:31.139 --> 01:53:39.270
and it has hurt Mr. Trump’s ability to legislate,
to focus on a lot of national security and

01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:49.190
domestic policy matters and that there is
growing tension in Washington over this issue,

01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:54.920
to me, I think Mr. Putin sees this as a tremendous
success, because if the United States is not

01:53:54.920 --> 01:54:06.090
able to exercise the full weight of its capabilities
internationally, Russia benefits.

01:54:06.090 --> 01:54:13.950
And also, given Mr. Trump’s view about the
U.S. role in the world, and from his inaugural

01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:20.100
address to other comments about the U.S. is
first, first, first, I think it has raised

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:26.900
questions in the minds of a number of our
allies and partners as well as in the minds

01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:32.219
of our adversaries about U.S. taking a step
back from that world stage, which is, I think,

01:54:32.219 --> 01:54:37.840
unnerving to a lot of our partners around
the world, which again, Mr. Putin sees as

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:42.010
beneficial to Moscow.

01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:49.690
I don’t know whether or not Russian interference
on our election had influence on a single

01:54:49.690 --> 01:54:50.690
vote.

01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:51.690
I have no idea.

01:54:51.690 --> 01:54:53.310
That was not our responsibility to do, and
I don’t know.

01:54:53.310 --> 01:55:00.010
But when I look at the aftermath, I think
Mr. Putin is fairly—is very content in terms

01:55:00.010 --> 01:55:06.030
of the deleterious impact it’s had on the
U.S. politically and internationally.

01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:15.600
Now, the U.S.-Russian relationship has not
gotten on a better track after the election.

01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.900
So from that perspective, I think Mr. Putin
has been frustrated.

01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:29.130
But I think overall he sees it as a net plus
in terms of what he did in an election and

01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:38.699
how it has consumed U.S. politics and the
U.S. public in many respects.

01:55:38.699 --> 01:55:44.880
Given that this is a story that’s still
playing out, I think Mr. Putin is very comfortable

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:47.290
with his decision to authorize this interference.

01:55:47.290 --> 01:55:51.690
JIM GILMORE - … Following up on the Flynn
story, you tell the beginning of the story.

01:55:51.690 --> 01:55:56.320
Are there lessons learned from how that came
down, the fact that he was eventually fired,

01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:59.884
but not until it came out in The Washington
Post the way the White House, the Obama White

01:55:59.884 --> 01:56:02.970
House viewed that story.

01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:07.570
Anything that you came away from on the Flynn
story that helps sum it up and sort of lessons

01:56:07.570 --> 01:56:08.980
learned?

01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:16.700
JOHN BRENNAN - I think one of the real lessons
learned is that, for any incoming administration,

01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:23.810
the initial team you put together, even before
you take office, you really need to make sure

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:32.000
that these are individuals of tremendous integrity
and individuals that the president-elect is

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.100
comfortable with sharing the most sensitive
national security information.

01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:41.100
Even though some people may have served previously
in government, or even in the military, there

01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:45.540
needs to be a very, very thorough vetting
process.

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:49.840
The Obama team had a very thorough vetting
process.

01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:56.440
Everybody had to meet the standards so that
you would have access to top-secret information,

01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:05.390
but also that you didn’t have any conflicts
of interest or ethical issues that would be

01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:06.390
disqualifying.

01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:13.719
That’s why I think that the Trump team was
a bit of a pickup game, quite frankly.

01:57:13.719 --> 01:57:16.110
It’s—again, understandably, because they
were surprised.

01:57:16.110 --> 01:57:17.679
They didn’t think they were going to win.

01:57:17.679 --> 01:57:20.750
Then, when all of a sudden they were faced
with the daunting task of putting together

01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:27.090
a team, things happened very quickly and rapidly,
and I think there was a looseness there that

01:57:27.090 --> 01:57:29.320
hurt us.

01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:36.679
There were people who came in and went very
quickly, that there should have been greater

01:57:36.679 --> 01:57:43.700
scrutiny and greater effort to ensure that
the people that were going to be brought in

01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:48.360
to the tent early on were going to be able
to stay there, and that they met the requirements

01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.570
of such high office.

01:57:49.570 --> 01:57:55.880
DAVID HOFFMAN - When you think back about
the aggressive efforts that were made in 2016,

01:57:55.880 --> 01:58:00.860
is the adversary here the opposing intelligence
services, in other words, the SVR and GRU?

01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:06.710
Or was there any evidence or did you have
a theory that also essentially there are non-state

01:58:06.710 --> 01:58:09.980
actors, maybe under the direction of the state?

01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:14.600
You’ve been very clear that you felt Mr.
Putin would have approved this, but how clear

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:19.880
do you feel is the chain of the actual actors
who carried it out?

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:22.350
Does it go to the other services, or is it
a little more ambiguous?

01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:27.460
JOHN BRENNAN - Well, I think right now, in
the cyber realm, a lot of intelligence services

01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:31.750
are building up indigenous capabilities, and
they’re quite formidable, especially when

01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:34.460
you're talking about the Russians and the
Chinese.

01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:40.719
But increasingly, these intelligence services
contract out a lot of the work, for a variety

01:58:40.719 --> 01:58:41.719
of reasons.

01:58:41.719 --> 01:58:49.100
One is that there's just tremendous capabilities
of these pop-up companies and firms and groups

01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:53.909
that can deploy malware and ransomware and
whatever else.

01:58:53.909 --> 01:58:58.159
There's tremendous expertise and capability
in the private sector, including in the Russian

01:58:58.159 --> 01:59:01.810
private sector, that the Russian intelligence
services take advantage of.

01:59:01.810 --> 01:59:09.010
But secondly, intelligence services, nation-states,
want to try to cover their tracks, and from

01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:15.179
a forensic standpoint, they want to have some
distance between the actual forensics of some

01:59:15.179 --> 01:59:18.100
type of attack and the nation-state.

01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:26.010
Therefore, contracting out some of these activities
allows them to take advantage of the expertise

01:59:26.010 --> 01:59:33.909
that resides out there, but also to make it
more difficult for attribution to be made

01:59:33.909 --> 01:59:38.830
and to see a nation-state behind these actions.

01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:42.179
JIM GILMORE - Let me ask one more thing.

01:59:42.179 --> 01:59:44.280
MICHAEL KIRK - (I’m not sure.)

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:45.330
The Comey firing.

01:59:45.330 --> 01:59:48.980
What was your reaction to the Comey firing?

01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:55.179
JOHN BRENNAN - When I heard that Jim Comey
was summarily dismissed, first of all, I thought

01:59:55.179 --> 01:59:59.890
it was done in an exceptionally disrespectful
way.

01:59:59.890 --> 02:00:05.590
Jim Comey has given much of his life to keep
this country safe and strong, did an outstanding

02:00:05.590 --> 02:00:14.600
job as the director of the FBI, and to be
treated that way I think really sent shockwaves

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:16.730
to a number of people, and especially at the
FBI.

02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:25.410
I think it showed the disdain that Mr. Trump
has for professionals and the FBI.

02:00:25.410 --> 02:00:33.409
I was also very disturbed, because it was
clear that Mr. Trump was dismayed and upset

02:00:33.409 --> 02:00:38.490
over Mr. Comey’s relentless pursuit of the
truth.

02:00:38.490 --> 02:00:43.810
And I wonder why Mr. Trump is concerned about
the uncovering of the truth if there's nothing

02:00:43.810 --> 02:00:44.840
to hide there.

02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:47.350
The FBI does a great job.

02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:48.860
It’s diligent.

02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:50.380
It’s patient.

02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:53.290
But it finds the truth.

02:00:53.290 --> 02:01:00.830
So I was concerned about what does this really
reflect on the part of Mr. Trump?

02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:04.560
Why is he trying to prevent the truth from
coming out?

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:07.800
Why is he trying to prevent the FBI from doing
its duty?

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:17.770
But I am confident that the FBI will continue
to do its work with even greater focused momentum

02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:18.849
as a result of this firing.
