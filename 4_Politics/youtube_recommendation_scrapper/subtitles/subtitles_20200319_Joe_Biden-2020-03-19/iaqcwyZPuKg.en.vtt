00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Don’t make me look too neat,
you’ll ruin my image.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.040
I spend my entire day messing up
my hair and you’re making it straight.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.680
You’ve gotta give him that Bernie edge.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.640
That’s right.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.920
You look beautiful.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.440
Thank you.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.080
Thank you, Senator.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Bernie, you look great too.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.720
Thank you.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.240
Let me get your
thoughts on something.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.600
You’re a Jewish Democratic Socialist

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.800
whose campaign manager

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.920
is a Pakistani Muslim
dude named Faiz [Shakir].

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Think of that image.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.520
When that image
goes to the White House,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.240
people are going to lose their minds.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.480
I don’t know that people
are going to lose their minds.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.600
I mean we don’t hire people because
they’re Pakistani or because they come–

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.080
We have some wonderful
woman who’s from Saudi Arabia,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.400
a number Jewish
people on our campaign.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.840
We have a lot of
African Americans, we have Latinos.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.840
We hire people because
they can do the job–

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.920
because they are smart, they are
hardworking and they can do their job. 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.280
And I don’t give a damn where they came
from or what their religion is.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.080
Now, maybe that sounds
radical, but that is what I–

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.440
No, that is very radical because I get it.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.640
You’re Jewish, but you’re pretty Muslim-ish.
A lot of the stuff that you've talked about–

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.400
I’ve been called many things
in my life, never “Muslim-ish.”

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.360
Muslim-ish.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.480
“Muslim-ish.”

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.520
This is living room stuff.
And Faiz, when you leave–

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.560
Faiz will break it down
for you. You know what it is.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.560
The stuff that you talk about is stuff that I’ve
been hearing in my living room for a long time.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.080
You want to demilitarize the United States.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.600
You don’t want a hawkish, aggressive
U.S. military around the world–

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.280
Well, demilitarize is a strong word.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.160
We need a strong military, but I want to make
sure that we resolve international conflicts–

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.800
Sure but–

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.800
Through other than military means—

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.080
But you don’t want a drone
strike every brown country–

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.640
Yes, correct.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.800
–into the Stone Ages.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.200
Yes.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.520
And you speak at Muslim conferences?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920
Yes. Why would I not speak
at Muslim conferences?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.920
Too many Muslims.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.880
I don’t speak at Muslim conferences!

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.760
I speak at as many conferences–
I speak at Jewish conferences,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.360
I speak at Muslim conferences,
I speak at Latino conferences,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.880
speak at African American conferences.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.520
You know what?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.840
We are a big country with a whole lot of
folks from different backgrounds. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.040
I’m running for president
and I think if I’m invited,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.960
I should speak to as many
of those groups as I can.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.960
But you’re trying to have a political career
in America. This is a PR nightmare.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.280
I don’t think so.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.440
So you have more faith in Islam than I do.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.680
I’m being serious! Like–

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.720
It’s not a question of faith in Islam,
it’s faith in the American people.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.320
- Okay.
- And I think–

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.440
And do you think the American people
are ready for this much Big Brown Energy? 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.280
I think the American people are disgusted with
Donald Trump’s effort to divide us up

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.080
based on our religion,
based on the color of our skin,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.800
 based on our sexual orientation,
based on where we were born.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.240
And what our campaign is about
is bringing people together.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.440
Jewish and Muslim and Christian and every
other religion, black and white and Latino.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.200
Asian American, Native American–

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.760
bringing people together around
an agenda that works for all of us.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.360
And by the way, around an
agenda that includes a vigorous,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.880
vigorous effort to combat the
global crisis of climate change.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.120
It doesn’t matter what color your
skin is, where you were born.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.640
You know what? We’re not going to have much of a
planet left unless we transform our energy system

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.120
away from fossil fuel.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.600
You have spoken out against a relatively hawkish and
aggressive U.S. military presence around the world.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.440
Under what conditions would you
consider using military force overseas?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.160
Well, look, we have the
strongest defense in the world.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.080
We have the strongest military in the world.
It may be necessary to use it. I am not a pacifist.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.840
I wish we lived in a world where we
didn’t have to use weapons and the military.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.360
But what I will tell you as somebody who
voted not only against the war in Iraq,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.640
and helped lead the opposition to that war,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.280
somebody who voted
against the first Gulf War,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.880
somebody who, when he was a kid,
marched against the war in Vietnam.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.400
War is the last resort. And I know it is very easy
for politicians to get– to stand up and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.120
give great speeches, and you know–

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.120
and then we send our working class kids over to
some country, in Iraq or Afghanistan to get killed.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.120
But we’ve got to do everything
we possibly can to prevent war. 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.680
And, you know, the goal should be diplomacy.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.840
The goal should be working with
people and doing everything we can

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.840
to prevent the bloodshed
that wars bring about.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.680
Would you like to lean more
on Congress in order to...

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.760
Yes. One of the problems that we’ve had in recent
years is that Congress has basically

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.320
abdicated its responsibility.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.720
You know that the Constitution
mandates that it is Congress,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.880
not the president, who goes
to war. But for many years–

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.400
Yes.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.520
under Democratic and Republican administrations,
Congress has abdicated that responsibility.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.440
And I’m very proud by the way, to
have led the effort in the Senate to–

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.000
to, for the first time, have the War Powers Act
actually passed in terms of the war in Yemen. 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.000
And we voted in the Senate and House
voted as well for the first time–45 years–

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.040
to tell the president of the United States that
he did not have the authority to get involved

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.720
in supporting Saudi Arabia
in a very, very terrible war.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.560
Unfortunately, Trump vetoed that legislation, but it
was the first successful use of the War Powers Act.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.720
Great. Thank you.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.560
I think we just got to just shift
into a simple yes or no question.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.120
Alright.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.120
Israel.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.840
Yeah.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.880
Yeah. Israel has every right in the world
to exist in peace and security.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.160
But the United States has got
to develop a foreign policy,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.920
which understands that we
need to treat the Palestinian people

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.640
with the respect and
dignity that they deserve.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.240
Our job is to bring Israelis and Palestinians together
and it is very difficult to create a path toward peace.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.560
- You’ve spoken out against the Israeli settlements.
- Yes.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.560
Would you withhold U.S. military aid if
Israel did not change its tune in regards to–

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.160
Let me be very clear as
somebody who is Jewish,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.920
who when I was young,
spent a number of months in Israel,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.240
on a kibbutz as a matter of fact.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.280
And that is–we give over $3 billion a year to Israel.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.400
And in recent years,
under the Netanyahu especially,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.520
we have seen this government
become an extremely right wing government,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.680
I believe, a racist government.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.440
And I think the taxpayers
of this country have a right

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.320
to say to the Israeli government,
“Look, we support you,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.480
we want to help you, but you know what? You
have to treat your neighbors with respect and dignity.”

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.440
And we have a strong carrot, and that is the
kinds of billions of dollars we’re giving to Israel.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.760
This is in regards to the aid.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.560
So let’s say hypothetically,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.560
Bibi’s [Netenyahu] nightmare comes true.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.480
You become president and
Iran wages war on Israel. 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.960
Do you send aid, even if they don’t change
their tune in regards to the settlements?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.720
We do everything we can to prevent that.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.800
I have a great deal of–Look, you’ve got a region of the
world, which has been in turmoil for a very long time. 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.400
All I can tell you is that the United States has got
to have a foreign policy which is even handed.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.120
What does that mean?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.880
It means that we work to do everything we can to
bring the Israelis and the Palestinians together. 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.040
It means that I am personally sick and tired
of the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.520
Now we have many, many years ago, for I
suspect oil reasons, sided with Saudi Arabia.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.080
They are wonderful people,
but you know what? 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.720
In all due respect, their government
is a government of demagogues, of murderers, 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.960
people who are horrific and
trying to repress democracy,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.160
treat women as third
class citizens. They’re not great–

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.200
You’re saying this. I’m not saying this. I got in
enough trouble in regards to this issue.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.240
Yeah I’m saying it.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.600
Senator Sanders, you were talking about canceling
$1.6 trillion of student loan debt, which is great–

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.400
but...

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.760
what about the people who just paid off their
student loans? What are you going to offer them?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.320
Well, we’re going to
offer them Medicare for All.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.360
We're going to offer them the
opportunity to send their kids to college—

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.880
public colleges and
universities– tuition free.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.720
We’re going to offer them good
paying jobs, et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.760
But right now, you’ve got a generation
of young people– they got a college education, 

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.360
and you should not be
punishing this generation,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.360
which is struggling so much right now,
with outrageous levels of student debt.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.000
I’m talking to people every day who
graduated college– $50,000, $100,000...

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.800
graduate school add a few zeros there.
I mean $3–$400,000 in debt–

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.520
Oh absolutely. Yeah.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.120
All right? These people can’t get
married and have kids. They can’t buy a home. 

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.080
They can’t buy a car. 

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.600
They’re paying... Oh, I talked to
a woman in New Hampshire.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.280
She’s not only still paying
off her own student debt,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.760
she’s paying off her
daughter’s student debt.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.080
Alright. That’s fairly insane.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.880
So if we could give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the
1% large corporations– which is what Trump did–

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.320
if we could bail out the
crooks on Wall Street

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.440
to the tune of trillions of dollars with
zero interest loans, you know what?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.360
We can cancel all
student debt in this country.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.840
And that would be a
tremendous boom for the economy.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.320
Instead of paying off, you know,
$200 a month student debt,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.320
people go out, be able to buy a car,
be able to buy their own home. 

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.920
Alright, you know 50 years ago, many public
colleges and universities were virtually tuition free.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.440
Did you know that?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.480
- University of California–
- Tuition free?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.000
Virtually tuition free. That’s right.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.400
So people were able to go to college
without coming out deeply in debt. 

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.360
It’s a reasonably new phenomenon
that you have to come out of

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.080
college with $50,000 in debt and
I think we should address that right away.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.520
Sure.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.040
Your debt plan would also give
a lot of money to rich families.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.840
- That’s kind of off brand for you. Why not set a cap–
- No, it does not.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.320
- But why not just set a cap on who gets that?
- Because I’ll tell you why. 

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.560
Because I believe in universal programming,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.640
and that means right now,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.800
- you’ve got public schools in New York City right?
- Yeah.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.480
In America?

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.400
Rich kids go to the public schools, but we say
public schools are available to everybody.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.000
You got social security, you know the
richest people in this country

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.040
get their social security check.
Doesn’t mean much to them, but they do. 

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.440
Everybody’s in. Everybody
contributes. Everybody gets.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.480
What we do in our
programming is tell those

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.720
very, very rich people that they are going
to have to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.160
In fact, we have proposed
a pretty significant wealth tax.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.080
So we believe in progressive taxation,
but we believe in universal programs.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.440
If some wealthy person–
I don’t know how many billionaires 

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.520
send their kids to
public colleges and universities.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.240
They choose to do that, that’s okay.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.320
Trust me, they’re going to be paying a hell of a lot
more in taxes to make that happen for everybody.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.360
Now, in order to do this–
this is pretty drastic stuff.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.600
You’re going to have to go through
the Republicans in Senate.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.880
Well, my hope is there will not be
Republican leadership in the Senate.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.640
We’re going to do our best to make
sure that they are not continuing to be in power.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.000
I mean, we know this and I have Indian
parents, best sometimes isn’t enough, right?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.160
I went to UC Davis. I wanted to go to
UC Berkeley. My best was UC Davis.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.960
So just like I was an Aggie,
Republicans may remain in Senate.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.520
And if that happens, you’re
going to have to negotiate with them.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.040
I have some pitches.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.200
You’re giving me more advice?
I’ve given you four jobs already.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.720
Of course.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.320
And now you need a–all right,
let me hear what you’ve got.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.560
- I’m going hard in the paint. Definitely, yeah...
- Alright.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.760
There’s going to be a hardworking
person in my administration.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.720
The first idea is would you consider expanding
Medicare for All to cover oil pipelines?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.440
See, I thought we were going
to do away with oil pipelines.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.200
I’m not going to make you
Secretary of Energy, that’s clear.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.400
This is the Mitch Pitch. You got to give
him something that he’s interested in.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.120
Health care for oil pipelines.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.160
- Sure. Or here’s another–
- So that when they spill–

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.400
break down and they spill– they
get the care they need, is that your point?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.080
Correct.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.800
Alright, got it.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.880
Or how about this? For every student who
gets their debt forgiven, you kill a white rhino.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.120
I hadn’t thought of that either?
Where do you come up with these ideas?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.000
I was thinking the white
rhino or the regular rhino.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.360
Either way you got to give them
something in exchange to get–

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.320
Problem with that is,
we’re running out of white rhinos.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.800
That’s why I said regular rhino–

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.920
- You have the option.
- Regular rhino–

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.360
Probably running out on them as well.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.000
If nothing else works, you could always release
Mitch McConnell like Dobby in Harry Potter

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.960
by giving him this sock.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.600
And this sock will...

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.760
- Well, when you give a gift to a house-elf–
- Yeah.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.680
They’re free.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.400
Oh.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.200
So you just walk over to
Mitch and say, “This is for you.”

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.520
All right, I’ll see Mitch soon.
I will make sure that he gets this.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.280
Free Mitch.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.200
Free Mitch, okay.
