00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.690

 Because you were smiling at us in this strange way all the way through I could cut a smile 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.409
 Can I hear singing and play the instrument together, but without the weirdness he smiles 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:24.559

 More listening to you talking about who I am listening to you playing if you are frank but when you started doing bad things 

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.609
 But I enjoyed a lot in some strange ways 

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.529
 It was ugly 

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.960
 It's like eating

 All right then guys 

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.049
 I am a bit nervous about introducing creativity because it speaks a little too much. It gets me a little bit of a problem 

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.090
 But I want you to be nice to him because he's only 12 years old and he's under my bed in a box 

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.520
 In the last three months the first dust has gathered 

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.790
 Read oh 

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.530

 Simon Cowell Butch told you this morning but that is the case 

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:14.590
 So straightforward, stop messing around. Come on, we need to be with the rats we're going to get 

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.810
 Okay from this in the end 

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.600
 David wolames you know david wolames he swam to convert two of china all spots david williams 

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.319
 Williams is not like the greatest comic genius of our time 

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.470
 No 

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.630
 Do you know anything that comes fly with me 

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:41.770
 Well that is coffee without cost without sugar we got the sweetener we got the courage to make a hot hot fire 

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:49.359
 But the Lord decided today that it will be the day when we have no water so we have. There is no choice but. To close the shop 

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.679
 So you know that there appears there is no 

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.790

 Breast You say we are in the same room 

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:20.050
 It's cheaper than The Dozen - Why didn't you say who's the funny one in the end 

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:27.909
 This is Simon Cowell Everyone knows Simon Cowell He is like the King of England who wears his pants up here 

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.759
 If what his talent James was what his talent Oh is it cleaning up 

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.350
 Is he cleaning 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.350
 What to wash 

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.100

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.350
 Does he brush off 

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.279
 No, it does not clean until you tell me 

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.160
 The boy does nothing 

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.549

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.210
 It wasn't supposed to be as good as David was and was annoying really perfect 

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.910
 Yes it was annoyingly good I didn't expect it at all in your iMpression very well 

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.599
 David say yes 

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.940

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.350
 The problem is 

00:15:53.029 --> 00:15:57.729
 She has much more than I would agree 

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.570
 It got this style 

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.110
 She got that smile She got to walk 

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:11.899
 It's got tuck it's got zing on There is only one thing 

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.750
 She got a penis 

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.529
 It got that torch that was watch away 

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:32.409
 That Girlish Great Speed ​​She Got Very Bad Pizzazz She Has A Penis 

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:44.619
 There is always some failure, always some defect, do they not call it? 

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.390
 Murphy's Law But Male Genitals This is where I draw the line 

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.899

 So I wrote the song is Yes I was true. It happens to you 

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:39.360
 Is this a true story and turning it into a song really well actually something like this happened to a friend of mine? 

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.130
 Oh, I know those friend of mine matters but this is actually true 

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.600
 You have no idea what I just did in my kids house? 

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.309
 Does everyone sit in the audience and they all sing this song later? 

00:17:57.509 --> 00:18:03.949
 Very cute ringtones I tell them to catch it I love to write Catchy Tunes that they don't write that way anymore 

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.809
 Crow I tell you something you know because I am really thinking that you are a whiff of fresh air 

00:18:14.629 --> 00:18:19.569

 84-year-old man believes 84-year-old men have lost their sense of humor in spades

 Sorry be right with you 

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.220
 Mira this is not a mirror so are we 

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.660
 Learn to listen until you go to sleep now 

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.400
 Time for the story 

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.629
 Well well all right I really regret if I told you a quick story 

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.979
 You promise that you go to sleep directly away from this story 

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.129
 Little Red Riding Hood heard 

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:57.370
 She was walking through the forest on her way to her grandmother's house when suddenly a big bad wolf suddenly jumped 

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:02.439
 Yeah one nasty with the biggest with it yeah i don't like it no but part of the story oh? 

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.109
 But it should be like okay 

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.170
 Okay 

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:12.319
 Well I'm going to change it What do you need to change to duck 

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.650
 The thing is with the story it won't work as a story if the duck duck was okay 

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.030
 Well it wasn't a big bad wolf, yes it was a big bad wolf 

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.750
 Duck 

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.029
 Little Red Riding Hood was really scared 

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.660
 Well because it is 

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.389
 You will not be afraid of a fluffy yellow duck if you know that you did it again in my story not working 

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.589
 You keep doing this to my story. Your persistence makes me put ducks in them 

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.720
 They don't work out your stories when they were a duck in them. What about Goldilocks yesterday and the Three Ducks 

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.540
 Snow White and the Seven Bowl 

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.970
 Why do you keep saying the duck 

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:13.059
 Yes 

00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:26.088
 This is fun for the whole family in a big family show, and you're a great family business 

00:22:26.969 --> 00:22:32.749
 How many puppies do I have I have a couple I have more than I have seen so far? 

00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:35.059
 Okay 

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:39.559
 She wants to see your doll 

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.959
 Well I just think your stuff is really really smart and you make us think they're real 

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.210
 They are really two people on the stage 

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:57.819
 Very well you know you are a cartoon Come to life I felt like I was watching a great song? 

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.080
 Cartoon you and this child and this dialogue is very cool 

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.639
 You're going to become a major competitor meaning I don't think anyone sitting in this room right now doesn't believe 

00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:19.939
 It was so wonderfully arranged that the joke jokes were great. It made a mature man feel like a child and I just felt just myself 

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:24.169
 Laughter and I was feeling happy and wanted that feeling 

00:23:24.659 --> 00:23:31.339
 And I want everyone to feel that feeling of joy until I love comedy and love you 

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:54.590
 Courtesy of Marlon on his choice because I feel as though we have a great man in you This is such talent What is your gift? 

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.959
