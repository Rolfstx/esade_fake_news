last night and he wants to be right on
on<00:06:17.520><c> the</c><00:06:17.639><c> he</c><00:06:18.030><c> wants</c><00:06:18.210><c> to</c><00:06:18.270><c> be</c><00:06:18.360><c> first</c><00:06:18.570><c> on</c><00:06:18.720><c> the</c><00:06:18.840><c> line</c>

on the he wants to be first on the line
and<00:06:21.380><c> so</c><00:06:22.380><c> I</c><00:06:22.410><c> think</c><00:06:22.560><c> that's</c><00:06:22.860><c> a</c><00:06:23.100><c> tremendous</c><00:06:23.370><c> is</c>

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's a tremendous is
 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's a tremendous is
tremendous<00:06:24.660><c> promise</c><00:06:25.789><c> based</c><00:06:26.789><c> on</c><00:06:27.000><c> the</c><00:06:27.090><c> results</c>

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 align:start position:0%
tremendous promise based on the results
 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.070 align:start position:0%

and<00:06:28.220><c> other</c><00:06:29.220><c> tests</c><00:06:29.789><c> this</c><00:06:30.210><c> tremendous</c><00:06:30.810><c> promise</c>

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
and other tests this tremendous promise
 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.469 align:start position:0%

and<00:06:31.560><c> normally</c><00:06:32.280><c> the</c><00:06:32.430><c> FDA</c><00:06:32.729><c> would</c><00:06:33.060><c> take</c><00:06:33.210><c> a</c><00:06:33.240><c> long</c>

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
and normally the FDA would take a long
 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.210 align:start position:0%
and normally the FDA would take a long
time<00:06:33.539><c> to</c><00:06:33.900><c> approve</c><00:06:34.139><c> something</c><00:06:34.440><c> like</c><00:06:34.740><c> that</c><00:06:34.979><c> and</c>

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
time to approve something like that and
 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
time to approve something like that and
it's<00:06:35.849><c> it</c><00:06:36.390><c> was</c><00:06:36.599><c> approved</c><00:06:37.020><c> very</c><00:06:37.890><c> very</c><00:06:38.159><c> quickly</c>
