♪ ♪

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Tonight...

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.930
&gt;&gt; This country goes into 2020
as divided as it's ever been.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: From "Frontline's"
award-winning political team--

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900
a two-night special series.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.130
Years of reporting investigating
the conflicts

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.500
and crossing the divide.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.730
&gt;&gt; People were angry.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.200
&gt;&gt; ...cascade of outrage.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.670
&gt;&gt; Outrage machine...

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.470
&gt;&gt; Are they going to start
storming the gates?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: "Frontline" begins
its 2020 political coverage

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.170
with the epic story
of how we got here.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.470
&gt;&gt; The nation's first African
American president...

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
A decade of division

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.870
defined by Barack Obama...

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.300
&gt;&gt; We will change the course...

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
...and Donald Trump.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.800
&gt;&gt; Make America great again!

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.670
&gt;&gt; The third president in U.S.
history to be impeached...

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.570
&gt;&gt; Today there's just a lack
of respect.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.800
To assume the other side is not
just the political opponent,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.430
but the enemy.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.930
&gt;&gt; And what this produces
is two Americas

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.230
that are separate not only in
their partisan affiliation,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.800
but in pretty much everything.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.130
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Tonight on "Frontline"--

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.270
part one of
"America's Great Divide."

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.270
♪ ♪

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
&gt;&gt; I remember when Barack Obama
got the call,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.430
uh, that he was going to make
the keynote speech

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.800
at the Democratic Convention
in 2004.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.870
And as soon as he hung up
the phone, he turned to me

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.230
and he said, "I know what I want
to say.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.030
I want to tell my story as part
of the larger American story."

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.530
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He delivered
the speech of his life.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.770
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.800
Tonight is a particular honor
for me because, let's face it,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.370
my presence on this stage
is pretty unlikely.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.000
My father was a foreign student,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.330
born and raised in a small
village in Kenya.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.170
My parents shared not only an
improbable love;

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.800
they shared an abiding faith
in the possibilities

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.470
of this nation.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.870
&gt;&gt; The idea of Barack Obama
being unique in so many ways--

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.370
unique with his funny name,
unique with his skin color.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.070
Or unique with his message:

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.000
"Look, I'm not a creature
of Washington.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.930
I'm new.
I'm just showing up.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.370
I'm willing to work
across the aisle."

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.100
&gt;&gt; There is not a liberal
America

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.570
and a conservative America,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.000
there is the United States
of America!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.100
(cheering and applauding)

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.500
There is not a black America
and a white America,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.400
a Latino America,
an Asian America,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.030
there's the United States
of America!

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.500
&gt;&gt; He was a star.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.700
That we hadn't seen a politician
like that before,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.900
not in recent history.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.970
He's going to tell it like it
is, and, you know,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.030
you can believe in what he says,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.070
and he doesn't seem to be so
wrapped up

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.100
in this partisan divide.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,
everybody, God bless you.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.430
&gt;&gt; He was going to be the one
who was going

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.200
to try to heal that wound.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Barack Obama
arrived with a promise of unity.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.030
&gt;&gt; Yes, we can heal this nation.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.100
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But his presidency
would usher in

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.670
an age of unprecedented anger...

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.570
&gt;&gt; Afro-Leninism.
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Resentment...

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.000
&gt;&gt; I want my country back.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Political
conflict...

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.600
&gt;&gt; The Republicans messed up so
bad...

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Polarization.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.800
&gt;&gt; What do we want?
&gt;&gt; Justice!

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.500
&gt;&gt; When do we want it?
&gt;&gt; Now!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A turning point...

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.970
(crowd chanting
"Drain the swamp!")

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.570
...in America's great divide.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.230
&gt;&gt; Presidential contenders
began their final push

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.200
in Iowa today.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.570
&gt;&gt; And because somebody stood up
a few more stood up,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.430
and then a few thousand
stood up,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.870
and then a few million stoop up,
Iowa, I need you to stand up...

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.570
&gt;&gt; I think what Obama
represented

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.070
was generational change.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.970
Here's a younger person
unburdened

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.470
by some of the old fights
of the past.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.600
He obviously represented racial
change in a way

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.500
that was very motivating
to African Americans.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.400
&gt;&gt; We will win this election,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.530
we will change the course
of history,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.630
and the real journey
to heal the nation

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.800
and repair the world will have
truly begun.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.100
Thank you, Iowa.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.830
&gt;&gt; He was also just an
incredibly talented

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.270
and charismatic and
inspirational politician.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.300
(crowd chanting Obama)

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.330
&gt;&gt; Obama's political rise came
at a time

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.800
when America was increasingly
divided.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.230
&gt;&gt; I can hear you, the rest of
the world hears you, and...

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: At the end of
George W. Bush's presidency,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.770
the nation was reeling.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.870
&gt;&gt; The country had been through
eight tumultuous years.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.800
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Steve Schmidt was a
Bush adviser

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.130
and counselor
to Vice President Cheney.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.470
&gt;&gt; We saw a war fought over
weapons of mass destruction

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.930
that didn't exist.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.300
&gt;&gt; ...disarm Iraq, to free its
people.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.270
&gt;&gt; We saw the United States
mired in a civil war in Iraq.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.300
&gt;&gt; I opposed this war
from the start...

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.770
&gt;&gt; And what Barack Obama was
offering was widely appealing.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.370
He represented
generational change.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.100
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.730
&gt;&gt; We can finally bring the
change we need to Washington.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.230
We are ready to take
this country

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.170
in a fundamentally new
direction.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2008,
as Obama ran for president,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.230
he delivered a simple message.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.370
&gt;&gt; The American people are
looking for change.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.230
&gt;&gt; There was a real ability
to project onto Obama

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.400
what you wanted to see.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.170
And he encouraged that, I mean,
"hope and change" is not a--

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.930
it's not an agenda.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.330
You know, "hope and change"
doesn't mean anything.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.830
"Hope and change" basically says
to the public,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.500
"Whatever you think
'hope and change' look like,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.900
that's what I can be."

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.670
(crowd chanting "Obama")

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.270
&gt;&gt; And the next vice president
of the United States,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.430
Sarah Palin.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Democrats weren't
the only ones

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.130
looking for a change.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.300
For Republicans, Sarah Palin
ignited a new political force.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.270
(crowd chanting "Sarah")

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.830
&gt;&gt; Sarah Palin came out and
brought the house down.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.830
She electrified that G.O.P. base
like no one I had ever seen,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.570
and you recall, that was one of
the times

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.270
where the prompter failed
and she just ad-libbed it.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.970
&gt;&gt; I love those hockey moms.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.100
You know, they say the
difference between

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.600
a hockey mom and a pit bull?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.800
Lipstick.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.400
(crowd laughs)

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.600
(cheering and applauding)

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.600
&gt;&gt; And people loved it!

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.470
She was almost a pre-Trump, in
the way that she

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.230
just sort of had this
matter-of-fact,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.830
sort of folksy,
she wasn't too high-brow,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.800
and so "real Americans,"

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.470
you know, "regular folks"
could relate to her.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.030
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not a member

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.000
of the permanent political
establishment.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.500
&gt;&gt; She was the beginning of the
shift

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.570
where the people began
to believe

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.430
that they could take the power
back from the elite.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.400
&gt;&gt; I've learned quickly these
last few days

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.930
that if you're not a member
in good standing

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.230
of the Washington elite,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.500
then some in the media consider
a candidate unqualified

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.930
for that reason alone, but...

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.200
(crowd booing)

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.730
&gt;&gt; She tapped into a simmering
grievance in the country

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.470
that's real.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.630
There's a rebellion
that's taken place

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.500
in this country against
the elites.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you,
and God bless America.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.700
Thank you.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For her supporters,
she was heroic.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.830
&gt;&gt; It's Saturday Night Live...

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But in New York
she was made into a joke.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.600
&gt;&gt; ...Governor Sarah Palin.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.200
&gt;&gt; First off I just want to say
how excited I am

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.870
to be in front of both
the liberal elite media

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.130
as well as the liberal
regular media.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.070
I am looking forward to a
portion of your questions,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.670
so let's get started.
Yes, you.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.800
&gt;&gt; You said that you like to
visit the quote,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.670
"Pro-America parts
of the country."

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.030
Are there parts of the country
that you consider un-American?

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, New York, New Jersey,
Massachusetts, Connecticut,

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:03.670
Delaware, California.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.270
&gt;&gt; When you started to see the
shine come off that car

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.230
was the Katie Couric interview.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.270
&gt;&gt; What newspapers and magazines
did you regularly read

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.700
before you were tapped...

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.870
&gt;&gt; Over time, as the camera
usually does,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.830
it brings out the truth.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.900
&gt;&gt; Um, all of them, any of them
that have been in front of me

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.230
over all these years--
I have a vast--

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.670
&gt;&gt; Can you name a few?

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.400
&gt;&gt; I have a vast variety
of sources where we get...

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.430
&gt;&gt; But most Republicans,
who already disliked the media,

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.730
blamed Katie for that.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.470
&gt;&gt; It's kind of suggested, it
seems like,

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.430
"Wow, how could you keep
in touch

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.100
with what the rest of Washington
D.C. may be thinking

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.530
and doing when you live up
there in Alaska?"

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.670
Believe me, Alaska is like
a microcosm of America...

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.670
&gt;&gt; Most Republicans looked at
that and said, "She was set up,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.230
that was a 'gotcha' question,"
and stood by Palin,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.530
and it just made them hate the
media more.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.700
&gt;&gt; I was reading today a copy of
the "New York Times"...

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.900
(crowd booing)

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.600
&gt;&gt; If you want to pinpoint the
moment

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.630
when the right completely
rejected the left...

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.930
&gt;&gt; We have a scarcity
of common sense...

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.130
&gt;&gt; I think it was over the Sarah
Palin nomination.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.370
&gt;&gt; Now, this is not a man who
sees America

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.170
as you and I see America.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.570
&gt;&gt; And for one brief,
shining moment,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.070
the right saw her as everything
they were looking for.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:39.370
Brash, tough, independent,
someone who said what they meant

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.430
and meant what they said, and
wouldn't edit it for anyone.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.430
&gt;&gt; She's something else.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.670
&gt;&gt; Sarah Palin has completely
transformed Republican Party...

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: McCain and Palin
wouldn't prevail,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.930
but the populist fervor
would grow.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.330
&gt;&gt; Boy, were you right about
this one,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.530
did you know how great she is?

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.000
&gt;&gt; It's the inauguration day

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.070
of the nation's first
African-American president.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.330
&gt;&gt; Hundreds of thousands of...

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.400
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Barack Obama had
promised unity.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.700
Much of the country seemed to
believe he could deliver it.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.970
&gt;&gt; I looked out, never forget,
from the west front

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.730
of the Capitol all the way down
to the monument.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.270
And I think it's about a mile.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.270
And all you could see were
people.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.300
A sea of people.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.930
The fact that our country
elected a black president

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.300
is just... it was huge in
significance.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.000
(cheering and applauding)

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.800
&gt;&gt; The thing I remember most
about that day

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.870
was an older white man turning
to me and my daughter

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.100
and him saying to her,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.070
"Young lady, you could be up
there one day.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.630
You could be president of the
United States."

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:57.100
I will never, ever forget
that moment.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.470
(crowd chanting "Obama")

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.500
&gt;&gt; Even Americans who had been
skeptical of Barack Obama

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.370
were giving him a look,
listening to what he was saying.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.930
I think, there was just an
enormous amount of good will

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.430
toward him and toward the
possibility of what might be

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.470
under this first
African-American president.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.500
&gt;&gt; Congratulations,
Mr. President.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.570
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.830
&gt;&gt; Obama led with that message
of,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.000
"We are now going to come
together,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.830
we're going to unify
this country,

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.330
even if you didn't back me,
I'm now going to usher in

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.470
this better part of your life."

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.630
(crowd chanting "Obama")

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.430
&gt;&gt; The first couple to arrive at
the Neighborhood Ball...

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.230
&gt;&gt; ...the first-ever
Neighborhood Ball

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.500
open to the public.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.170
&gt;&gt; ♪ At last ♪

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.930
(crowd cheering)

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.170
&gt;&gt; He seemed like a kind
of redemptive vision

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.200
for American politics.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.730
People on the national stage saw
Barack Obama

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.430
as a kind of man apart
from the pettiness,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.200
the various kinds of ways in
which politics

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.770
did not reflect the highest
aspirations

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.630
of the United States
as a society.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.370
And he's black.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.330
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.830
In retrospect, it's easy to see
how that was a doomed mission

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.900
from the start.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.800
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In fact, that very
evening, across Washington,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.730
Republican leaders gathered.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.770
&gt;&gt; A meeting, a dinner, took
place in a famous steakhouse

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.670
in downtown Washington.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.800
&gt;&gt; The room was filled.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.730
It was a who's who of ranking
members

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.030
who had at one point been
committee chairmen,

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:59.170
or in the majority,
who now wondered out loud

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.830
whether they were
in the permanent minority.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.000
&gt;&gt; Many of them had attended
Obama's inauguration.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.670
They had seen that
breathtaking spectacle

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.230
and it felt like a wholesale
repudiation

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.270
of the Republican Party.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As the night
wore on,

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.400
they talked about
a plan of attack.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.200
&gt;&gt; The point I made was that we
had to be prepared

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.530
to run a full-court press.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.570
And we had to see how Obama
behaved

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:30.400
and to offer an alternative to
what he wanted to do.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.800
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They would try to
block the president,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.570
fight his agenda,
exploit the divide.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.200
&gt;&gt; I thought, he could be
defeated partly

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.330
by his own ideology
and by his own behaviors.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.470
&gt;&gt; Ball gowns are on their way
to the cleaners,

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.330
the party is over for both the
new president and the nation.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.570
&gt;&gt; Now, he is facing many
sobering challenges.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.400
&gt;&gt; The economy, it's a
frustration with the economy...

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.870
&gt;&gt; Back to the economy, then,
obviously it's issue number one,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.400
it's on the front pages
of every newspaper.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.900
&gt;&gt; The economy that Barack Obama
inherited, I think,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.930
is the defining event
of this generation,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.730
even more so than 9/11,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.700
and it profoundly reshaped
American politics.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.700
&gt;&gt; Anger from the U.S. public
towards bankers is high.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The economy was
collapsing.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.100
&gt;&gt; The growing backlash against
Wall Street...

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trillions of
dollars had been used

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.300
to prop up Wall Street.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.530
Middle-class Americans were
angry.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.370
&gt;&gt; They took to the streets to
express their anger.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.870
&gt;&gt; Frustration with financial
bigwigs continues to grow.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.070
&gt;&gt; The way it looked from ground
level was that the big banks,

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.130
the people who had created the
financial crisis,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.570
were being bailed out

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.030
when the little guy
was being screwed.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.570
&gt;&gt; On the heels of growing
public anger aimed at banks...

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.430
&gt;&gt; ...backlash against
Wall Street...

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Before he could
deliver on his promise of unity,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.630
Obama had to confront the
economic crisis.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.000
&gt;&gt; The banks need to be held
accountable.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.800
&gt;&gt; We were told by our economic
advisers

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.270
that there was a one-in-three
chance that the country

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.130
would slip into a second Great
Depression.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:01.070
We were on a ledge and we could
fall off that ledge.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: His new secretary
of the treasury was overwhelmed.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.200
&gt;&gt; We'd already thrown trillions
and trillions of dollars

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.630
at the problem.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.130
I think it was, you know,
it was a very perilous moment,

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.800
a very existential moment at
that point.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.070
&gt;&gt; How do you respond to that?

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.470
Not only how do you respond
to it in terms

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.870
of getting the economy
moving again,

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.130
but how do you respond to it in
holding people accountable

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:24.530
for what happened?

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.530
And that was a definition
moment.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Some of his
political advisers argued

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.530
for what they called
"Old Testament justice"--

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.600
punishing the banks.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.030
&gt;&gt; David Axelrod, Obama's top
political adviser,

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.100
very much wanted some scalps.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.300
Robert Gibbs,
who was the press secretary

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.130
but also a very senior
political aide, wanted scalps.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Geithner told the
president taking on the banks

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.570
could make the economic crisis
much worse.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.270
&gt;&gt; You had to make sure you kept
concentrated

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.970
and focused on the core basic
imperative

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.400
that was going to affect
the fortunes of, you know,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.170
hundreds of millions
of Americans--

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:06.870
not get too wrapped up in trying
to design political theater.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:12.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the end, the
president would be cautious.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.170
&gt;&gt; Barack Obama is inherently
very conservative.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.970
And he also wants to believe the
best in other people,

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.700
and he really does believe that
everybody can ultimately find

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.000
common ground and work together.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.700
I think it was a mistake,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:31.530
because the bankers really
got off very easy.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.600
And the public knows it.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.570
&gt;&gt; There was a perception that
President Obama flinched

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.070
at that point.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.770
That, that in one way or
another,

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:47.170
he was not prepared to go there,
to, to go after C.E.O.s,

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.570
or to take people to court
and to charge them with,

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.670
with things.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Anger and distrust
of the government would grow.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.070
(crowd chanting)

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.330
&gt;&gt; It was deeply, deeply
unpopular.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.570
And this came at a time when
people were losing their homes,

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:15.570
were losing their jobs, and felt
like they had been abandoned.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.700
(tambourine banging)

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.300
&gt;&gt; The rich and the powerful get
away with anything.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.330
Oops! Oops!

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.900
They F up and, and I have
to share in the losses.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.430
And every American does.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.500
I mean, that just-- it just
burns up ordinary people.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.770
It is just ordinary middle-class
people thinking,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.300
"I can't get away with that!"

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.630
&gt;&gt; The government is promoting
bad behavior, because we...

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And on cable
television, the talk had already

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.100
begun of something they called
"a Tea Party."

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.330
&gt;&gt; ...and think that they ought
to save it.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.400
&gt;&gt; The word "Tea Party" is born
in a CNBC moment

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.700
when Rick Santelli,
a somewhat agitated--

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.030
even under the best of
circumstances--

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:05.000
reporter for CNBC in Chicago
starts to... starts an uproar.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.530
&gt;&gt; This is America!

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.930
How many of you people want to
pay for your neighbor's mortgage

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.070
that has an extra bathroom and
can't pay their bills?

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.270
Raise their hand!

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.470
(others booing)

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.200
President Obama,
are you listening?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.370
We're thinking of having a
Chicago Tea Party in July.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.730
All you capitalists that want to
show up to Lake Michigan,

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.370
I'm going to start organizing.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.370
&gt;&gt; This created a level of anger

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.700
like I haven't seen since I got
involved in politics

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.600
in the 1980s.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:41.970
People really, really resented
this president

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.670
for siding with the rich and
powerful, and forgetting them.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:53.400
That was the onus where
the Tea Party was created.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.370
&gt;&gt; You gotta be kidding me!

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.270
What are we putting up with,
America?

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.800
&gt;&gt; Like, that will get
the economy kicking.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.270
Well, did it?

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.970
No, it didn't-- $450 billion
down the crapper.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.530
&gt;&gt; Give us a trillion dollars

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.970
and, oh, everything will be
great.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.200
Well, exactly the opposite
happened,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.270
so can we revoke
that bailout now?

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Even as the
economic crisis was roiling

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.770
the country, on Capitol Hill,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.400
Barack Obama wanted
to push Congress

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.800
to take on another
divisive issue--

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.100
overhauling healthcare.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.830
&gt;&gt; I was his political adviser,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.630
and I understood how much
political currency

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.970
it would take to pass that law.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.070
And he said, "Well, what are we
supposed to do,

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.330
put our approval rating on the
shelf and admire it

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.700
for the next eight years?

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.670
Or are we supposed to draw down
on it to try and solve

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:48.030
some of these really big,
intractable problems?"

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.630
&gt;&gt; Let there be no doubt:
healthcare reform cannot wait,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.700
it must not wait, and it will
not wait another year.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.270
(cheering and applauding)

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:02.370
We can no longer afford to put
healthcare reform on hold.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.630
We can't afford to do it.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.370
It's time.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.430
&gt;&gt; There is nothing more fraught
than healthcare,

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.970
because it is so personal
and it is so intimate.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.930
And every political party that
decides to take on healthcare

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.530
in some massive, poorly
understood way,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.570
reaps both the backlash and, and
political retaliation.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.070
&gt;&gt; Americans are
seriously worried

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.900
that this is going to destroy
the healthcare...

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.500
&gt;&gt; This has been on the left's
to-do list

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.400
since either FDR or LBJ got it
done.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.930
They have just been waiting,
waiting, waiting.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.230
"When we have the presidency
and both houses of Congress,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.970
we are going to push this
through."

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.630
&gt;&gt; It's about too much power
going to federal government.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.270
&gt;&gt; The whole point of this is to
get everybody enrolled

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.300
in the government
healthcare plan.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: From across the
divide, Sarah Palin reappeared,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.730
wielding a new political weapon.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.970
&gt;&gt; She was a maven on Facebook.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.530
The original politician who saw
that you could skirt the media,

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.400
and you could get the message
out unfiltered,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.300
uncut to the public,
was Sarah Palin.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.130
She did that with Facebook.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.270
(keys clicking)

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.730
&gt;&gt; As more Americans delve into
the disturbing details

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.630
of the nationalized
healthcare plan,

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.430
our collective jaw is dropping,

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:24.100
and we're saying not just no,
but hell no!

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: She exploited fear
with a new phrase

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:30.170
that went viral-- death panels.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.070
&gt;&gt; The America I know and love
is not one in which

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.770
my parents or my baby with Down
syndrome will have to stand

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.200
in front of Obama's
"death panel."

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It wasn't true.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.030
&gt;&gt; She is the first
of a generation of politicians

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.900
who live in a post-truth
environment.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Steve Schmidt had
also been a top campaign aide

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.230
for John McCain's presidential
run.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:02.200
He had pushed McCain to select
Sarah Palin.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.400
&gt;&gt; She was, and there's no
polite way to say it,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.630
but a serial liar.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.370
She would say things that are
simply not true.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.700
Or things that were picked up
from the internet.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:19.970
And this obliteration of fact
from fiction, of truth from lie,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.330
has become now endemic in
American politics.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.500
But it started then.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.970
&gt;&gt; She introduced the term
"death panel"

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.500
when referring to it.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The right-wing
media ran with it.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.270
&gt;&gt; And we're going to have
a government rationing body

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.700
that tells women with breast
cancer, "You're dead."

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.430
&gt;&gt; We now have leftist radicals
in charge

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.830
of your healthcare decisions
rather than doctors.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.570
We're hanging by a thread.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.170
♪ ♪

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.930
&gt;&gt; If you think this country is
great,

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.730
but Obama and the tsars are
marching our country

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.670
right off a cliff,
save your life.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.570
Grab the parachute, pull,
and come follow me.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Glenn Beck was a
former top-40 disc jockey.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.370
He rose to the pinnacle
of Fox News

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.970
during the presidency
of Barack Obama.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.630
&gt;&gt; To watch the coverage
from the right-wing media

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:12.170
of the Obama years now is
to experience true hysteria.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.170
To see Glenn Beck every day

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.670
and the things he was saying
about the president...

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.000
&gt;&gt; I've got my little Messiah
here, my dashboard Obama.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.570
I'm going to pray to him later,

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.570
maybe get some universal
healthcare.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.500
Now, for more insanity

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.570
and blood shooting out
of your eyes, Obama.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.700
&gt;&gt; You would have thought
the nation was collapsing.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.370
&gt;&gt; President Obama, why don't
you just set us on fire?

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.070
For the love of Pete,
what are you doing?

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.870
This is not the America I grew
up in, or you grew up in.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.530
When we said change,
we didn't mean this!

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.430
Nobody meant this!

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.030
&gt;&gt; It would never have happened
without Glenn Beck.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:59.470
Glenn Beck was the catalyst for
the uprising.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.700
&gt;&gt; If you want to understand
Barack Obama...

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.330
&gt;&gt; Glenn had the perfect
phraseology

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.800
that took this anger
and channeled it

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.600
into an organization
that rose up from nowhere.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For Beck and Fox--
record ratings.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.400
&gt;&gt; Glenn Beck was the kind of
seeding

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.200
of this conspiracy theory.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Ben Rhodes was one
of Obama's closest aides.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.600
&gt;&gt; "Obama is seeking to control
your lives."

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.370
You know, "Obama has a secret
plan to do X or to do Y."

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.000
Or, "This shadowy figure
in the Obama administration

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.130
wants to regulate every aspect
of your life."

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.470
And it kind of starts there.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.500
And then it, it gets darker
and darker.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Facebook and
meetup.com welcomed Beck

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.300
and other angry Americans.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.130
Now they would organize.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:26:00.730
&gt;&gt; You had this vast outrage
machine that arose on the right.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.470
And this, this outrage machine,
you're talking about, you know,

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.730
not just the Tea Party, but talk
radio, Fox News,

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.270
really changed the nature
of our politics in ways

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.400
that I think we're living with,
with today.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.170
&gt;&gt; We're mad as hell and we're
not going to take it anymore!

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The outrage machine
online.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.100
&gt;&gt; You want to kill my
grandparents,

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.270
you come through me first!

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Anger on the ground.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.070
&gt;&gt; You dirty thieves!

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.570
&gt;&gt; We can't afford it!

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.000
&gt;&gt; Afro-Leninism!

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.830
&gt;&gt; There is an ugliness
with these fringe people

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.170
who are comparing the president
to Hitler.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.700
&gt;&gt; This is not simply a
disagreement about policy,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.630
this is a repudiation of Obama
and, more significantly,

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.100
a repudiation of Obama's race.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.400
&gt;&gt; His church was based on
racism.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.730
&gt;&gt; They're depicting Obama as an
ape, you know, on, on signs

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.400
that they're carrying.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.900
There are pejorative stereotypes
about Africa and Africans.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.400
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama's election
offered hope of racial harmony.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.900
But in that first year,

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.130
it was clear that race was
a central part of the divide,

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:11.900
and his presidency
was a flash point.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.930
&gt;&gt; Obama was a big symbol.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.900
You know, every time you turned
on your TV,

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.500
you were reminded that the
country was changing

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.670
in fundamental ways.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.070
I mean, we had had 200 years of
presidents.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.500
We had never had one that looked
like Barack Obama.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.130
And his just mere presence
in the White House

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.370
was a daily reminder that
this is a different America

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.530
than many people
had grown up with.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.530
And it scared the hell out
of a lot of people.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.100
&gt;&gt; Prominent African-American
Harvard scholar

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.830
Henry Louis Gates, Jr...

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One early incident
enflamed both sides.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.900
&gt;&gt; Arrested in his own home.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.730
&gt;&gt; His arrest is prompting
outrage.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.230
The story grabbed national
headlines

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.100
because the man in question

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.870
is one of the nation's most
prominent

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.430
African-American scholars.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.670
&gt;&gt; Professor Henry Louis Gates
is arrested in his own home

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.400
for trespassing.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.700
And Barack Obama says what
virtually every black person

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.370
in the country thought.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:14.030
&gt;&gt; That the Cambridge Police
acted stupidly

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.070
in arresting somebody when
there was already proof

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.230
that they were in
their own home.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.770
Thank you, everybody.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.400
&gt;&gt; All of a sudden, there's
pressure on the other side.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.900
There are people who are saying
that he's anti-cop,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.370
there's a concern
that he's racist.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.030
&gt;&gt; This president, I think, has
exposed himself as a guy,

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:38.670
over and over and over again,
who has a deep-seated hatred

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.770
for white people
or the white culture,

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.770
I don't know what it is.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.430
This guy is, I believe,
a racist.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.070
&gt;&gt; People lost their minds.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.430
He had the largest drop in his
polling numbers

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:52.970
of anything that happened

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.430
in the eight years
of the Obama presidency.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.600
&gt;&gt; Hey. Cameo appearance.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He apologized.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.170
&gt;&gt; These are issues that are
still very sensitive

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.630
here in America.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:10.170
And, you know, so, to the extent
that my choice of words

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.630
didn't illuminate but rather
contributed

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:17.670
to more media frenzy,
I think that was unfortunate.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.670
All right?

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.170
Thank you, guys.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:24.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Then he went even
further: a photo op.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.530
&gt;&gt; Obama did this very
awkward thing

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.430
where he called in Henry Louis
Gates and the police officer,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.200
and they had this beer summit.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.730
&gt;&gt; He would probably say that
that was one of

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.600
the most ridiculous moments
of his presidency.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.500
Not so much that he brought
a black Harvard professor

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.900
and a white Cambridge cop
together,

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.770
but the fact that the media
anointed it a "beer summit."

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was a painful
lesson.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.830
&gt;&gt; And the lesson he took from
that is, like, "This is a loser.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.070
If I'm weighing in on these
racial issues,

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:04.300
it's only going to galvanize
the, the forces against me."

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:07.870
&gt;&gt; What I didn't appreciate as
much then

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.370
was just how much Obama would
become

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.830
a symbol of change
in the country,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.170
a change from a, you know,
a white America

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:23.100
to a more diverse America,
a more cosmopolitan America.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.500
I think he became a symbol for
segments of our country

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:33.130
of change that they did not
welcome.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.070
&gt;&gt; Time for a little healing
over some beers, my friends.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.500
He wants you to pay attention

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.330
because his poll numbers
are tanking.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:44.770
&gt;&gt; This is just-- folks, it is
a lousy, lousy image

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.530
to present to America.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.470
&gt;&gt; Now they're using the poor
cop as a, you know, a stooge

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.270
here to make believe
he did it all.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.830
We are skating on very thin ice
with this man

00:30:53.830 --> 00:31:00.930
in the White House, and you've
only seen the beginning of it.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.430
&gt;&gt; Madam Speaker.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.330
&gt;&gt; The President of the United
States.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.730
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:09.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Healthcare reform
was stuck.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:13.100
The divide with the Republicans
was widening.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.370
Obama would demand action.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.270
&gt;&gt; The time for bickering
is over.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.730
The time for games has passed.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.670
Now is the season for action!

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.600
Now is when we must bring the
best ideas of both parties

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.170
together and show the American
people that we can still do

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.970
what we were sent here to do,
now is the time to deliver

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.630
on healthcare!

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But at that moment,
the outrage machine arrived

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.330
on the floor of Congress.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.570
&gt;&gt; There are also those who
claim that our reform efforts

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.070
would insure illegal immigrants.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.970
This, too, is false.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:56.130
The reforms...

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.530
(members murmuring)

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.070
The reforms I'm proposing would
not apply

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.800
to those who are here illegally.
&gt;&gt; You lie!

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.400
(audience exclaiming)

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.730
&gt;&gt; It's not true.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.970
&gt;&gt; A member shouted, "You lie!"

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:13.230
&gt;&gt; You lie!
(audience exclaiming)

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was Republican
Representative Joe Wilson

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.670
from South Carolina.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.370
&gt;&gt; Well, the Tea Party
experience came right into

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.770
the, you know,
the House chamber,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.170
but to see that sort of
disrespect

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.630
on the floor of the House
directed towards

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.470
the president of the United
States, I think,

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.600
caused everybody's head to snap.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:35.800
&gt;&gt; You lie!

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.970
(audience exclaiming)

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.670
&gt;&gt; Not too many years before,

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.500
he would have resigned in
disgrace from the Congress,

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.730
and he would have been called
upon to do so

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.130
by leaders of both parties.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.030
Instead, what happened?

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:57.670
He raised a couple million
dollars overnight.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.170
What's the lesson there?

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:06.330
There's no longer a punishment
for dishonesty, for craziness.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.670
It's rewarded.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:12.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The president faced
an emerging reality.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.370
The Republicans' inauguration
day pledge to oppose him

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.930
was coming true.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.770
There was no way health reform
would be bipartisan.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.100
&gt;&gt; He wasn't going to get a
Republican vote for anything.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.470
If you're going to tell Barack
Obama that you can't do anything

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.170
without a Republican vote,
you're telling him,

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.830
"You cannot do a single thing
as president,

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.300
that you just...
you're just going to sit there

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.070
and do nothing."

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.330
Because the Republicans weren't
going to give him votes

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.770
for anything.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.070
&gt;&gt; Barack Obama came
into office thinking,

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.800
"Well, I can reason with them.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.000
If I've got good arguments,
they're reasonable people,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.230
and we'll come to some
reasonable conclusion."

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.300
Well, he was wrong.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.030
That was not there.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.330
The Republicans didn't want to
give him any victory.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.330
It had nothing to do with reason
or logic,

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.070
they just didn't want to give
him a victory.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.430
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
He would fight back,

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.830
rallying his Democratic
supporters--

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.370
including many young, diverse
liberals.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.630
&gt;&gt; Do not quit!
Do not give up!

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.300
We keep on going!

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.730
We are going to get this done!

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.570
We are going to make history!

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:26.900
We are going to fix healthcare
in America with your help!

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.130
God bless you, and God bless
the United States of America!

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.870
&gt;&gt; Down to the wire on
healthcare reform.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.770
The House votes just hours
from now.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.830
&gt;&gt; After months of rancor
in the streets,

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.400
the vote takes place
in just a few hours.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It had consumed the
first year of his presidency.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.000
&gt;&gt; Members will record their
votes by electronic device.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.270
On this vote, the yeas are 219,
the nays are 212.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.170
The motion is adopted.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.800
&gt;&gt; It's 219 to 212.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.400
No votes from Republicans.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.070
&gt;&gt; All Democrats,
no Republicans.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.070
&gt;&gt; This is a huge victory
for this president.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.500
&gt;&gt; For decades, they've been
trying to do it.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.270
It has now been done.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.870
&gt;&gt; This legislation will not fix
everything

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.000
that ails our healthcare system.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.630
But it moves us decisively in
the right direction.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.500
This is what change looks like.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.130
&gt;&gt; Obamacare got shoved down
our throats

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:26.730
without majority support in the
country, which was a huge thing.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.230
And people were angry.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.900
Republicans were angry.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.970
And I don't think Republicans
have ever forgiven him for it.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:37.370
&gt;&gt; ...what many call socialized
medicine.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:40.570
&gt;&gt; It's the most brazen assault
on a fundamental aspect

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.030
of our republic...

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.070
&gt;&gt; ...every single Republican
senator votes consistently

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.870
against government-run
healthcare

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.000
should be a clear indication.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.700
&gt;&gt; This is going to be the end
of the economy as we know it.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.100
&gt;&gt; By passing a healthcare
program essentially on

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.800
the strength of one party,
it was fated, destined

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.170
to become a continuing partisan
divide,

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.570
part of the issues
that would come up

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.800
in election after election
from then on.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.430
&gt;&gt; ...the perfect title,
"Lies, Damn Lies,"

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.030
that's what Obamacare was all
about.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The anger directed
at Obama was growing.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.400
There were even questions about
who he really was

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.600
from across the divide.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.870
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.800
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.870
&gt;&gt; The birther movement was so
powerful

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.070
was because it spoke to all
types of other anxieties

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.270
that many white Americans had
about Barack Obama.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.870
"Well, he's not even from here,
he's not one of us.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:48.730
Prove it.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.200
Prove you were born here."

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.070
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Right-wing websites
picked it up.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.070
&gt;&gt; He won't even produce a birth
certificate,

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.400
don't you love that?

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Talk radio joined
in.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.470
&gt;&gt; Something there that the
president doesn't want

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.870
people to see on that birth
certificate.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.530
&gt;&gt; If you have nothing to hide,
why won't you show...

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.130
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Before long,
it caught the attention

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:08.770
of reality TV star Donald Trump.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.770
&gt;&gt; He asks me about it.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.530
He says, "Have you read
this stuff?

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.830
It's very interesting, there's
a lot of odd questions here."

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.900
But he brings the issue
into the mainstream.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.430
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Roger Stone was
a longtime political adviser

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.000
to Trump.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.430
He has since been convicted of
lying to Congress.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.300
&gt;&gt; Trump understands among
Republicans

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.470
there's a very substantial
majority

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.400
who have questions about
Obama's origins

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.300
and how he just pops up out of
nowhere

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.530
to become a national figure, and
whether he was in fact eligible

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:46.000
to serve as president.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.170
&gt;&gt; We thought that Trump needed
an issue

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.200
that resonates with people.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.470
The birth certificate meant a
lot of different things

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.700
to a lot of different people.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.430
Overall, it talked about how
Obama was different,

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:01.730
he was a different kind
of person,

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:05.000
he was a Manchurian-type
candidate.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.170
&gt;&gt; ...they release the birth
certificate.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump was thinking
of running against Obama

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.470
in 2012.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:14.600
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter whether
I have doubts or not.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.170
&gt;&gt; Please welcome my friend
Donald Trump.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He made himself the
face of the birther movement.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.930
&gt;&gt; Why doesn't he show
his birth certificate?

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.130
I think-- I think he probably...
&gt;&gt; Why should he have to?

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.900
&gt;&gt; Because I have to and
everybody else has to, Whoopi.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.400
Why wouldn't he show...

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.730
Excuse me.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:30.070
No, excuse me.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.030
I really believe there's a birth
certificate.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.370
Why-- look, she's smiling.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:37.330
Why doesn't he show
his birth certificate?

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.400
&gt;&gt; I never heard any white
president asked to be shown

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.600
the birth certificate.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.630
&gt;&gt; Everybody does.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.770
&gt;&gt; When you become a
president...

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.130
&gt;&gt; You are not allowed
to be a president

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:46.800
if you're not born
in this country.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.970
He may not have been born in
this country...

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.400
&gt;&gt; That was the racist
manifestation

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.770
of resistance to the president.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.900
Donald Trump was at the
forefront of it.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.830
I think it, it rankled
President Obama

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.100
because the birther stuff
was just a pure

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.270
racism-slash-xenophobia,
and it was based in nothing.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:07.630
&gt;&gt; More than 40% of the
population still question

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.800
whether he's actually an
American or not.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama had already
released his birth certificate

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.370
during the presidential
campaign.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.300
But the issue wouldn't go away.
&gt;&gt; Obama was furious.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.930
It wasn't Trump.
It was the media.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.270
If Trump couldn't get booked on
all those shows,

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.970
he'd just be some...
another whack job,

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:29.730
you know, tweeting about
conspiracy theories.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.070
And maybe getting booked on Fox.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.030
He's a-- Donald Trump
is a creation

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:37.500
of the American
political news media.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.470
And that's what angered Obama,

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.130
that's what angered us in the
White House.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.570
&gt;&gt; The great part about a guy
with your resources

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.770
that you were able to deploy
people to go and find out

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:47.000
what is actually going on

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.630
with Barack Obama's birth
certificate.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.170
What did you find?

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.270
&gt;&gt; Well, we're looking into it
very, very strongly.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.730
Nobody knows who he is.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:54.730
It's very strange.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.830
The whole thing is very strange.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.730
And she was saying he was born,
essentially, in Kenya.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.270
And if he wasn't born
in this country,

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.700
it's one of the greatest scams
in the history of politics

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.570
and in the history, period.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.130
The more I go into it, the more
suspect it is.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama reluctantly
released more proof

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:12.700
of his citizenship.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.400
&gt;&gt; Now, as many of you have been
briefed,

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.130
we provided additional
information today

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:23.570
about the site of my birth.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.970
This thing just kept on going.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:31.000
Yes, in fact, I was born
in Hawaii, August 4, 1961,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.770
in Kapiolani Hospital.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.700
We've posted the certification

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.970
that is given by
the State of Hawaii.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Three days later,
it was time for payback.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.170
&gt;&gt; The president uses the White
House Correspondents' Dinner

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.970
that year, with Donald Trump
in the room,

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.270
to completely ridicule
Donald Trump

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:56.230
in front of this audience
that, you know,

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.970
that, you know, journalists and
lobbyists

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:01.130
and government officials.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:02.700
And people who, at that time,

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.630
Trump wanted to have
the respect of.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.770
&gt;&gt; All right, everybody,
please have a seat.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.030
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.970
Donald Trump is here tonight.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:16.630
(cheering and applauding)

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.170
No one is happier,
no one is prouder,

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:24.170
to put this birth certificate
matter to rest than The Donald.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:28.030
And that's because he can
finally get back to focusing

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.270
on the issues that matter--

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:34.300
like, did we fake
the moon landing?

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.630
(audience laughing)

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.930
&gt;&gt; I was two tables away
from Trump.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:44.130
The conventional way in
Washington of absorbing a joke

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.270
at the White House
Correspondents' Dinner

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.530
is to keep your chin up

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.530
and at least pretend to have
a sense of humor about it,

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:55.070
even if you go cry
into your pillow that night.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.970
Trump was steaming.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:01.730
His face was all locked in--
he was not having a good time.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.230
&gt;&gt; All kidding aside, obviously,

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.170
we all know about your
credentials

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.130
and breadth of experience.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.470
(audience laughing)

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.330
For example...

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.670
No, seriously, just recently,
in an episode

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:19.930
of "Celebrity Apprentice,"
at the steakhouse,

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:23.530
the men's cooking team did not
impress the judges

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.630
from Omaha Steaks.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.000
And there was a lot of blame
to go around.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.670
But you, Mr. Trump,
recognized that the real problem

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.470
was a lack of leadership.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.130
And so ultimately you didn't
blame Lil' Jon or Meatloaf.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.530
(audience laughing)

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:42.400
You fired Gary Busey.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.300
(audience laughing)

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.470
And these are the kind
of decisions

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.600
that would keep me up at night.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.300
(audience laughing)

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.500
(cheering and applauding)

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.470
Well handled, sir.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.800
Well handled.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.470
&gt;&gt; But it just kept going and
going

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.270
and he just kept hammering him.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:08.430
And I thought, "Oh, Barack Obama
is starting something

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.800
that I don't know if he'll be
able to finish."

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.300
&gt;&gt; Say what you will about
Mr. Trump,

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.100
he certainly would bring some
change to the White House.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.330
Let's see what we've got up
there.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.100
&gt;&gt; I think that is the night
that he resolves

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.530
to run for president.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:29.200
I think that he is kind of
motivated by it.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.130
"Maybe I'll just run.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.230
Maybe I'll show them all."

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.530
&gt;&gt; Every critic, every detractor
will have to bow down

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.300
to President Trump.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.930
It's everyone who's ever doubted
Donald, who ever disagreed,

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.930
who ever challenged him,
it is the ultimate revenge

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:55.570
to become the most powerful man
in the universe.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.970
&gt;&gt; God bless you

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.300
and may God bless the United
States of America.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.170
(audience applauding)

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:05.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Neither Trump,
nor the birther issue,

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.970
were going to go away.

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.530
&gt;&gt; Back to this birther business
for just a second.

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:13.700
&gt;&gt; Obama is an unknown man,
may not be a citizen,

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.530
surrounded by radicals,
surrounded by terrorists.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.030
&gt;&gt; If Obama were such a shoo-in,

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.130
Donald Trump would not have had
any jokes told about him

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.570
on Saturday night
at the White House...

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.900
&gt;&gt; ...the copy of the new fake
birth certificate.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.870
Now, we've looked at it, we're
going to go over why it's fake,

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.730
how it's a composite...

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:35.430
&gt;&gt; Democrats are nursing a major
midterm hangover.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.170
&gt;&gt; No sense in sugarcoating
last night's...

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Out in the country
and in Washington...

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.600
&gt;&gt; Tuesday's election
was a game changer...

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The divide was
growing.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.730
And in the midterms,
angry Republicans rose up.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.570
&gt;&gt; A repudiation of the
president and his policies.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:48.700
&gt;&gt; That is a very unhappy
electorate.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Democrats lost
control of the House.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:52.800
&gt;&gt; Democrats of every stripe
were voted

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.400
out of office last night.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama called it
a "shellacking."

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.100
&gt;&gt; Voters, they went to the
polls tonight to send a message

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.500
to Barack Obama.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.730
&gt;&gt; I can tell you that,
you know, some election nights

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.500
are more fun than others.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.500
Some are exhilarating,
some are humbling.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.530
&gt;&gt; In 2010, it became an
election very much about

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.430
President Obama and about how
his administration

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:19.130
was much more liberal than what
the country wanted

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.170
or had voted for.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.100
It was as if, you know,
"We've been betrayed,

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.100
this is a president who's going
to take us off

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.400
in a crazy dangerous direction,
and we can't let that happen."

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.930
&gt;&gt; And we won races in every
corner of the nation,

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.730
in such a broad and
wide victory,

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.030
that the outcome
is unprecedented.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:37.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: 87 new Republicans
joined what became known

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.470
as the "Tea Party Congress."

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.830
&gt;&gt; The Tea Party movement has
given life

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:43.570
to the Republican Party.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.400
&gt;&gt; The Washington leadership
of the Republican Party

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.300
saw energy and enthusiasm
amongst the grassroots,

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.600
so the leaders sought to
capitalize

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.730
on the energy of that movement.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:57.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The 87 were rebels
who had run

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.900
on changing Washington.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:04.400
But their first challenge
was their own leader,

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.700
the Washington
insider John Boehner.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.230
&gt;&gt; I now pass this gavel and the
sacred trust that goes with it

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.700
to the new speaker.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.270
God bless you, Speaker Boehner.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.770
(members cheering)

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Boehner had a
reputation as a dealmaker--

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:23.330
someone willing to work
with Democrats.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:24.930
&gt;&gt; I didn't need to be speaker

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.270
because I needed a fancy title
or a big office.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.300
I wanted to be speaker so I
could lead an effort

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.870
to deal with the serious issues
that are facing our country.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:36.400
&gt;&gt; Obama used to tell me, "John
Boehner is just like

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.000
the Republicans that I worked
really well with

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.530
in the Illinois State Senate,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.930
a Midwestern country club
Republican.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.530
He's not a racist,
he's a good and decent man."

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.700
He has serious ideological
differences with Obama,

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.470
but they could get stuff done
together, right?

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:53.270
&gt;&gt; I'll be working with
a bipartisan...

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.400
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And Obama believed
he knew just how to reach out

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.930
to a country club Republican:
golf.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:03.170
&gt;&gt; Before the golf match
started, I told the president,

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.170
I said, "Mr. President,
this is about golf,

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.100
not about anything else."

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.330
And he and I were partners.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.630
We played well and we won.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:16.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama had more
than golf on his mind.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.230
He wanted to make a deal

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:21.370
to solve the country's
fiscal problems.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.270
&gt;&gt; I suggested to the president,
you know,

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.000
"Why don't we have
a conversation?"

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.900
And he agreed.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But it would be
dangerous for Boehner.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.370
The Tea Party faction was
watching him.

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:39.730
They would have to meet
in secret.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.400
&gt;&gt; Well, that was Boehner's
decision, not ours, obviously.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.430
It's not every day that the
speaker comes

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.530
to see the president quietly
and says,

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.400
"I'm willing to do a deal,"

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.030
that everybody knows is going to
be dangerous

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.970
for him politically.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The speaker
secretly entered the White House

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:57.500
through a side entrance.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:01.700
&gt;&gt; Because it was so difficult
for John Boehner to be seen

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.300
as working with Barack Obama, he
would be snuck in the back door

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.070
of the White House.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:09.030
He'd come in on the weekends, or
he'd come in at night,

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.800
and kind of sneak the guy
through and, like, sit there

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.000
with Obama, and negotiate
or have a drink, right?

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They talked
of a "grand bargain,"

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:21.900
a once-in-a-generation deal
to reduce the deficit.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.370
Obama would agree to cut
entitlements,

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.530
Boehner to raise taxes.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.030
&gt;&gt; The Republican leadership was
willing to make a deal.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:31.730
John Boehner was willing to make
a deal.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.630
And the president was able to
get Democratic leaders

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.230
in Congress to sign off
on that deal.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:39.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But back at the
Capitol,

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:41.170
Boehner was confronted by
resistance

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:44.370
from his Tea Party members.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.870
&gt;&gt; There was support for what
was being discussed

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:52.770
at the White House was not there
in the Republican conference.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:55.000
There was no way that a majority
of Republicans

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.370
were going to support what the
president was talking about.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:01.330
It just wasn't going to happen.

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.930
&gt;&gt; It was absolutely scuttled
by Boehner's own people.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.930
But the fact was,
he couldn't get it done.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.800
He didn't have the strength or
the conviction

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.230
to, to have a fight about it in
his own party,

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.230
and it, and it fell apart.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.400
&gt;&gt; It's a bad idea
for Speaker Boehner

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.100
to meet alone
with President Obama.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.130
&gt;&gt; Tea Party nation calling for
John Boehner to step down.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.870
&gt;&gt; ...and the screw-up is the
leadership

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:23.970
in the House of Representatives,

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.700
rather than trashing
conservatives.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.000
&gt;&gt; Boehner's a complete fraud.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.970
The Tan Man always claims to
have the pulse

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:32.130
of the American people...

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.600
&gt;&gt; He never had any control of
this caucus,

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.270
and whenever he took anything
back to his caucus,

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:39.130
they just tore him apart
and ate him alive.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.270
They would lose their minds.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:45.030
And so then, we realize there is
no "grand bargain" to be had

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.130
with these people.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.970
&gt;&gt; I just got a call about
a half-hour ago

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:56.530
from Speaker Boehner.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:02.330
It is hard to understand why
Speaker Boehner would walk away

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:05.530
from this kind of deal, and
frankly, I think that, you know,

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:08.630
one of the questions that the
Republican Party's going to have

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:14.200
to ask itself is, can they say
yes to anything?

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.030
Can they say yes to anything?

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:17.630
Thank you very much.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:19.400
&gt;&gt; The Republicans were more
than happy

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.830
to take the votes
of the Tea Party members

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.330
and the Tea Party
freshman class.

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:27.170
But it changed the nature of
the caucus in fundamental ways.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:32.400
You now had a hard group, hard
group of congressmen and women

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.400
who were really not interested
in governing.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.970
They were more interested in
taking a stand,

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:44.670
and frustrated one legislative
procedure after another.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.800
&gt;&gt; The establishment part
of the Republican Party

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.070
didn't understand that
by allying themselves

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.870
with the Tea Party, they were,
in a sense,

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:58.170
writing their own death
certificate in a way

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:00.700
that would lead to the takeover
of the Republican Party

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.230
by Donald Trump.

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:04.400
&gt;&gt; He has no one to blame
but himself.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.600
I'm not going to do the
waterworks of John Boehner.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.100
&gt;&gt; I want to salute
the Freedom Fighters

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.430
in the House of Representatives,
and they're not going to take

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.930
John Boehner's crap
sitting down anymore.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.270
&gt;&gt; ...gone along just to get
along with President Obama,

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:17.830
like Speaker Boehner.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:19.300
You know, we need to thank them
for their service,

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:26.930
and say,
"Okay, time for new energy."

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.300
♪ ♪

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.300
&gt;&gt; Tonight on "Nightline."
License to kill?

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:37.370
It's the shooting death that's
sparked an explosion of outrage.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:38.830
Good evening, I'm Terry Moran.

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:41.030
It's the story that's ignited
fierce passions

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.630
across the nation, as
allegations of racism

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:48.100
and miscarriage of justice tear
apart a small Florida town.

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For Obama, once
again, the issue of race.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.370
&gt;&gt; Trayvon Martin was walking
back from a convenience store

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:57.270
when he was allegedly shot
by a Neighborhood Watch...

00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:58.800
&gt;&gt; Police have the gun,
they've got the shooter,

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.530
but they have not arrested him.

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:03.070
The dead man's grieving family
wants to know, "Why not?"

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.970
&gt;&gt; President Obama, as the first
African-American president,

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.630
had been very careful not to
talk too much about race.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.900
It was frustrating to some
African Americans.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:17.130
Then Trayvon Martin is killed in
Florida, and the country gasps.

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:20.700
The country is, is really on
edge.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.900
&gt;&gt; Here's a teenager walking
through the neighborhood

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.700
where his father lives,
committing no crime,

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:31.270
bothering no one,
who is followed, confronted,

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:34.400
and ends up in a physical
altercation with a stranger

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:38.230
where he ends up killed.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.300
And then the person
who killed him

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.530
is allowed to go home that day.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.070
&gt;&gt; The contradiction of this
happening in the midst

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.130
of a black presidency
sharpened the irony

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:53.100
and intensified the pain I think
people felt around this.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.770
&gt;&gt; African Americans who had
turned out in record numbers

00:52:55.770 --> 00:53:00.530
for him, who, in some ways,
Obama owed his presidency to,

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:04.230
felt as though he wasn't saying
enough about race.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:05.100
&gt;&gt; People were pushing him.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:05.930
"Say something.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:07.470
Are you going to say anything?

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:08.570
You're a black man.

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.630
A young black boy has been
murdered

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:15.200
by a guy who's a hyped-up, you
know, neighborhood watchman.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.800
Black America is traumatized
by this."

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.170
Silence from the White House.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:24.730
Nothing-- no leadership,
no, no insight.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.470
(cameras clicking)

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Finally...

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.130
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everybody.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:32.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Nearly a month
after the killing,

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.630
the president was publicly
confronted about it.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:38.670
&gt;&gt; Can you comment on the
Trayvon Martin case, sir?

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:44.800
&gt;&gt; My main message is, is to
the parents of Trayvon Martin.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.000
Um... You know, if I had a son,
he'd look like Trayvon.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.630
And, um...

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:57.300
You know, I think they are right
to expect that all of us

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.300
as Americans are going
to take this

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.230
with the seriousness it deserves

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:03.630
and that we're going to get to
the bottom

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:05.630
of exactly what happened.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:08.030
All right, thank you.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:10.930
&gt;&gt; It showed and it underscored
the complications,

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.770
the difficulties of the first
black president

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:15.970
weighing in on issues of race.

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:19.570
That by his very presence, by
his very willingness to discuss,

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:24.100
he himself was bringing
the partisan guns to the fight.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.830
And suddenly, an innocuous
statement

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:30.500
became deeply inflammatory
to half of the country.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.970
&gt;&gt; ...the president had a son,

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.200
he wouldn't look anything
like Trayvon Martin.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.200
He'd be wearing a blazer from
his prep school.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.670
He'd be driving a Beamer.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:42.370
&gt;&gt; We have a president who has,
who has frozen racial tension

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:45.200
in our country instead of
thawing racial tension.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It blew up on Fox.

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:50.300
&gt;&gt; The president's goal
is to heighten

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.630
African-American turnout
by stoking a feeling

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:58.170
of victimization in the
African-American community.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it took off
on an increasingly powerful

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:04.900
new platform: Breitbart.

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.100
&gt;&gt; We were the blog kind of for
the Tea Party.

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.170
This Tea Party energy,
you know, right after

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:11.500
the financial collapse.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.970
We caught on with this kind of
working-class,

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.900
middle-class audience.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They were the voice
of the populist outrage

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:20.200
Sarah Palin had activated,

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.100
running stories that stoked fear
and division--

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.700
black-on-black crime,
Islamic terrorism,

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.970
violence by immigrants,
a culture under assault.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.570
&gt;&gt; "Hispanic and black thugs

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:35.000
tend to attack Asians
because ..."

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.530
&gt;&gt; "Blacks are incapable
for being responsible ..."

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.100
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Breitbart's comment
sections became notorious

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.100
gathering places
for extreme viewpoints.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.100
&gt;&gt; "The towel heads are taking
over because we've let them."

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.070
&gt;&gt; "Gayness is a cancer..."

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:49.030
&gt;&gt; I mean, it reads like you've
walked into a hate club

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.370
gathering of some kind.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:52.430
&gt;&gt; "How stupid are women?
Let's find out."

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:53.830
&gt;&gt; They were appealing to
the segment of the population

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:56.230
that are racist, homophobic,
anti-Semitic--

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.500
really, the worst among us.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.000
Creating this congregating space
every day,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.770
where people from that worldview
can go and rally around

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:10.270
one another to find content
that validates their worldview.

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:13.300
And I think that's what they
were building, ultimately.

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.070
&gt;&gt; Think that there was a
failure to appreciate

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:20.600
the extent to which these online
communities were forming,

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:24.030
and these online ecosystems
were forming.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.800
That if you were someone who
spent all day in your car

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.270
listening to Rush Limbaugh and
got home and watched Glenn Beck

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:31.170
at night and then opened your
Facebook page

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:34.500
and saw a bunch of Breitbart
links, it didn't really matter

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.400
to you "The New York Times"
and "The Washington Post"

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.200
had said that birtherism
wasn't true.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.130
Didn't matter how many
Pinocchios that FactCheck

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.530
had gotten of Donald Trump's
latest talk show appearance.

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:45.930
&gt;&gt; There's a story on Breitbart,

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:49.070
Republican National Committee
declares war...

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:51.300
&gt;&gt; This was provided to me
by Breitbart...

stories in the past few years

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:57.070
than most journalists who like
to dust off their awards

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:58.530
on their shelves.

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:00.130
&gt;&gt; They're going to keep the
race business alive,

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:02.570
and it's going to prosper during
the Obama administration,

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:04.970
'cause that causes more chaos.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:06.870
&gt;&gt; They want to stir up racial
hatred in the country,

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.100
and you know what?

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.830
I'm not afraid to talk
about race--

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.700
let's talk about it, let's see.

uphill battle.

Nate Silver wrote a piece

of the "New York Times

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:55.300
"Is Obama Toast?"

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A very different
Barack Obama headed out

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.800
to do battle with
the Republicans.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.030
It was not a campaign
about unity.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.230
&gt;&gt; We knew that we had to run

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:10.570
a very hard-edged reelection
campaign

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:15.000
that posited the president as
someone who was battling

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.630
for the middle class.

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:18.000
(crowd applauding)

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.900
&gt;&gt; If I said, "The sky was
blue," they said, "No."

If I said, "There were fish
in the sea," they said, "No."

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:30.870
They figured, "If Obama fails,
then we win."

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.730
&gt;&gt; President Obama decided,

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:34.300
"We're going to have an argument

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:48.970
the Republicans messed up so
bad...

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.430
&gt;&gt; He's a more scarred president
who has become himself

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:54.430
frustrated by the way
Washington works,

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.830
no longer quite so believing
in the idea

00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:59.230
that bipartisanship is possible.

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:01.830
It was a different message than
it was in 2008.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.670
It was not a "Come Together"
message.

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:06.630
It was not a "Hope and Change"
message.

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:11.030
It was a "Stop the Other Guys"
message.

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:14.030
&gt;&gt; It's the same agenda that
they have been pushing

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:15.800
for years.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:22.400
Republicans were also at war--
with themselves.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.970
The establishment had gotten
behind one of their own,

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:30.030
wealthy businessman Mitt Romney.

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:32.670
&gt;&gt; Barack Obama has failed
America.

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:36.100
This country we love
is in peril.

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.730
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:41.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Tea Party saw
him as out of touch.

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.870
&gt;&gt; He verges on hysterical.

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:44.330
Mitt Romney has never done a
single thing

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:46.030
to favor the conservative
cause...

00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:47.600
&gt;&gt; I swear, every time Mitt
Romney opens his mouth,

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:51.400
I have no... I think he's
running against me.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.300
&gt;&gt; I don't think that Romney was
somebody who understood

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.570
the angst of the American
people.

00:59:56.570 --> 01:00:00.870
He didn't understand what, what,
especially the Republicans in,

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:02.930
throughout the United States,
were feeling,

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:06.070
how, how disaffected they felt.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.830
&gt;&gt; What does Mitt Romney
believe?

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:09.230
&gt;&gt; And is he truly a
conservative?

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.430
&gt;&gt; Not exactly a person of
conviction, not even...

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:11.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Romney needed
the Tea Party

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:16.070
and its populist base.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.130
Trying to win them over,
he went to Las Vegas

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:22.070
for an endorsement-- from the
man who put the birther movement

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:24.200
on the map.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.030
(audience applauding)

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.430
&gt;&gt; Mitt Romney looks completely
uncomfortable.

01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:31.030
Donald Trump is totally
in his element.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:33.270
It's, in a curious way,
it's Donald Trump's event,

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.470
not Mitt Romney's event.

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:39.030
He, you know,
he, he commands the stage.

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:42.670
&gt;&gt; It's my honor, real honor,
and privilege

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:46.170
to endorse Mitt Romney.

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:47.870
&gt;&gt; It was literally
one of the most bizarre

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.400
political scenes I'd ever seen.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.670
&gt;&gt; And by the way, this
is a great couple...

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:53.800
&gt;&gt; Mitt and Ann Romney were
standing up there.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800
And I kept looking at Ann
Romney,

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.900
who looked like she was using

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.600
every single bit of energy
she had not to start

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.000
cracking up uncontrollably.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.770
At that moment, it seemed like,
you know, not unlike Sarah Palin

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:10.530
four years earlier,
kind of a comic diversion,

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:12.570
something that was different.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:17.070
&gt;&gt; So, Governor Romney, go out
and get 'em, you can do it.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.470
&gt;&gt; It was hilarious;
it was bizarre.

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:21.200
In retrospect, I guess it
represented

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.070
some kind passing of the torch.

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:26.900
&gt;&gt; There are some things that
you just can't imagine happening

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.830
in your life.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.400
This is one of them.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.670

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:32.630
Being in Donald Trump's
magnificent hotel

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:35.400
and having his endorsement
is a delight.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.770
I'm, I'm so honored, and...

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.500
&gt;&gt; It was a tacit endorsement
in the other direction

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.670
of Mitt Romney to the kind of
rhetoric

01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:44.100
that Donald Trump was vociferous
in trafficking in

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.970
around Obama's birth
certificate--

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.870
the, the perpetrator of a
blatantly nativist campaign

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.400
against the president of the
United States.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.570
went back to New York City,
and he started tweeting.

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.370
&gt;&gt; "This election is a total
sham and a travesty.

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:32.800
We are not a democracy!"

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.900
(tweets)

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.230
"We can't let this happen.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:38.370
We should march on Washington
and stop this travesty.

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:39.500
Our nation is totally divided!"

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.800
(tweets)

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.870
"We should have a revolution in
this country."

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.100
(tweets)

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was
an opening salvo

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:50.300
in a campaign to capture
the conservative base.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.200
And just six days later,

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.470
Trump signed this trademark
application

01:02:54.470 --> 01:03:00.670
for the phrase
"Make America Great Again."

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:04.470
&gt;&gt; Right after Romney lost,
we had a brief chat.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.800
"Can Hillary be beat?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.970
Who else is going to run?"

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:08.630
He's already handicapping.

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:10.670
Romney's body isn't even cold
yet,

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:13.870
and he's already handicapping
this election.

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:17.870
It was clear to me then he was
going to run.

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:19.800
&gt;&gt; The president of the United
States has been reelected.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.230
Barack Obama wins...

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.000
&gt;&gt; ...defeating Mitt Romney
following an often nasty...

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama's coalition
had prevailed.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.100
&gt;&gt; Another four years for
President Barack Obama.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:31.400
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Now he would test
whether the election

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.500
had consequences.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.800
&gt;&gt; Obama gets reelected, you
know, rather decisively.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.870
And, you know, he was hopeful
that this fever would break.

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.270
He kept saying, like,

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:43.770
"Hopefully, this breaks
the fever."

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:48.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To win, Obama had
energized Latino voters.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.000
Republican leaders had taken
note.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.570
Now the president hoped they
might be willing to work

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:57.770
with him on immigration reform.

01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:00.630
&gt;&gt; Everybody understood
that there was an opening,

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.500
a political opening, because
Republicans were ready

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.370
to come to the conversation.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:06.330
And so the president's marching
orders to his team

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:09.400
were very clear:
"This is a priority.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.200
I want to get it done."

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.500
&gt;&gt; The Republicans did a
sobering study

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.570
of where things stood,
and they realized,

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:20.830
after 2012,
that America's changing,

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:22.430
and that if you wanted to win
the White House,

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:25.230
not just Congress, you had to
appeal to younger voters,

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:28.000
Latinos, and women.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.470
&gt;&gt; "We must embrace and champion

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.200
comprehensive immigration
reform.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.330
If we do not, our party's appeal
will continue to shrink."

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:42.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: GOP power brokers
like Majority Leader Eric Cantor

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.830
laid out the party's problem.

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:48.900
&gt;&gt; Too many millennials,
minorities,

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.070
and others have rejected us
at the polls

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.470
because they sense that somehow
we're not inclusive.

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:58.200
And unless we show
the American people

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.930
that conservative principles
actually help them

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:03.800
in a real, and not just theory,

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.000
we'll never get the majority

&gt;&gt; Today, a bipartisan group of
senators unveiled a plan that...

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:13.200
&gt;&gt; Now Republicans and Democrats
set to announce

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.500
a major compromise surrounding
immigration.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.230
&gt;&gt; ...is one of those issues...

01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Republican Senator
Marco Rubio

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:22.100
was the face of bipartisan
immigration reform.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.030
&gt;&gt; (speaking Spanish):

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:29.830
&gt;&gt; The political class was sure
that immigration reform

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:32.600
was going to be
like falling off a log.

01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:42.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Even on Fox News,

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.270
support for the softer
immigration approach.

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:48.830
&gt;&gt; And even people like Sean
Hannity went on the air

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:50.230
and said, "We need to rethink
our position

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:51.730
on immigration.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:55.230
I was wrong to take such a hard
line on, on immigration."

01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:57.300
&gt;&gt; You create a pathway for
those people that are here.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.270
You don't say,
"You got to go home."

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:03.930
And that is an... a, an, a
position that I've evolved on.

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:05.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Sean Hannity
invited Obama's nemesis

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:09.530
and Fox regular onto his show.

01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:12.130
And even he seemed to favor
immigration reform.

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.300
&gt;&gt; I think it's getting very
tough to win as a Republican.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.030
Look, they've lost on
immigration.

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.970
They're going to have to do
something on immigration.

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:20.900
Because, you know, our country
is a different place

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:21.970
than it was 50 years ago.

01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:23.300
So we'll see what happens.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.430
&gt;&gt; Mr. Trump, always a pleasure.
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:29.800
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama's wish in the
aftermath of his reelection--

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.400
that the fever would break--
seemed like it might come true.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.570
But there was a new wrinkle.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:39.800
&gt;&gt; What was interesting is,
the fever broke

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.170
among certain Republican elites,
right?

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:47.200
The problem is, that's not where
the Republican voters were

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:51.100
or the majority of the
Republican House caucus.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: At Breitbart,
the chairman, Steve Bannon,

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:57.930
was sowing division,
rallying the populist base

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:01.570
against the Republican
establishment.

01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:03.400
&gt;&gt; I said, "Let's attack the
real enemy,

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.970
and the real enemy's the
Republican establishment.

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:09.300
What we're going to do is just
go after the House leadership,

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.470
we're going to go after
the Mitch McConnells,

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:12.430
we're going to go after the
donors.

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.300
We're just going to go hard at
kind of this

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.030
Paul Ryan philosophy."

01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:19.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bannon and
Breitbart weaponized

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.830
immigration against
the establishment.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:25.530
&gt;&gt; We spent a lot more time
talking to the public

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:29.570
than we spent talking
to the elite.

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:31.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The issue lit up
Breitbart's already

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.870
incendiary message boards.

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.000
&gt;&gt; "Illegals kill 12-plus people
a day in this country."

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.470
&gt;&gt; "Torturous, murderous,
rapists.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.700
This president calls them
'Dreamers.'"

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.900
&gt;&gt; "Deport all of the illegal
aliens."

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.300
&gt;&gt; It is potentially, the threat
of an open border

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.330
is pretty catastrophic.

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:49.300
Immigration, to Republican
voters, by a mile,

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.470
it's the number-one issue,
even ahead of tax cuts.

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:55.970
&gt;&gt; This was some of the
brilliance of Bannon.

01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:59.370
He recognized an anxiety that
had been building

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:02.000
in the heartland for years.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.800
The country itself felt like it
was changing, and,

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.600
"Are these people here
illegally?

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.470
Did they skip a step in line?

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.300
Did they follow all the rules?"

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.470
Again, the, the economy for so
many Americans has still

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:13.970
been so frustrating.

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:16.500
So all of this is happening
while people have real questions

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.130
about their own security.

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:20.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bannon decided
it was time was

01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:24.200
for a show of force,
to use immigration

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.470
to take down a central figure in
the Republican establishment.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.700
&gt;&gt; And when they looked around,
the guy that they thought

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.030
was most vulnerable
was Eric Cantor,

01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:35.600
the House majority leader.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Cantor was up for
reelection.

01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:42.000
Tea Party challenger Dave Brat
was more than 30 points behind

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.530
in the primary.

01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:46.630
&gt;&gt; I... he definitely knew it
was coming.

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:48.400
(stutters): That was, also
happened to be my home district,

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.830
but I could feel it.

01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:51.400
I knew that, that a guy like
Brat could... they were...

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.000
they were very weak.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.770
&gt;&gt; Cantor, can you believe
this guy?

01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:56.070
Can you believe Ryan?

01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Breitbart swung
behind Brat.

01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:00.100
&gt;&gt; Eric Cantor, he's all in
for amnesty.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They set the agenda
for right-wing radio.

01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:04.570
&gt;&gt; You're a coward, Eric Cantor.
You only...

01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:07.330
&gt;&gt; ...Eric Cantor, who wants
amnesty; Paul Ryan, who I...

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.570
&gt;&gt; Anything that became talking
points on conservative radio

01:09:09.570 --> 01:09:11.030
were coming from Breitbart.

01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:14.630
And you had a transformation
where conservative radio hosts

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:17.230
weren't clicking on Drudge
Report on what to say,

01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:20.530
they were clicking on Breitbart.

01:09:20.530 --> 01:09:21.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It worked.

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:23.600
&gt;&gt; History-making upset--

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.830
House Majority Leader Eric
Cantor lost...

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:27.700
&gt;&gt; This was a seismic shift that
took

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.430
all of the establishment
figures...

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:32.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Cantor's defeat
sent a message to Republicans.

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:35.330
&gt;&gt; ...a new Republican Party,
with fresh faces...

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:37.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bipartisan
immigration reform was dead.

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.400
&gt;&gt; House Majority Leader Eric
Cantor's defeat

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.730
is the end of immigration
reform.

01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:46.600
&gt;&gt; I knew that night
when I heard.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.200
I was talking
to my Republican...

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.070
they were, basically,
"There's no reason

01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:51.700
for us to talk anymore.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:55.670
This is not going anywhere."

01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:57.830
&gt;&gt; You can almost feel
the Capitol shake.

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:59.930
I've never seen so many people
crying with long faces,

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:03.600
all upset on Capitol Hill.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.830
I mean, that's, I think,
the worst drubbing

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:10.970
the establishment has had
in, in many years.

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:15.800
&gt;&gt; It was the elected
Republicans and talk radio

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.370
realizing that the people
who vote for them

01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:22.570
and watch their media hated
their guts.

01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:25.070
Absolutely hated their guts.

01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:27.470
&gt;&gt; It was clear that the voter
base was throwing out

01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:31.500
the Republican establishment's
ideas on immigration.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.070
That's what that represented.

01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:34.630
And it was stunning,
it was one of the biggest upsets

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.930
in the history
of American politics.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:26.930
People want an immediate
reaction from Barack Obama

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:29.500
and his administration.

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.270
&gt;&gt; He ain't armed, he don't got
no gun, they just killed him.

01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:34.570
His blood everywhere.

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:38.400
&gt;&gt; Ferguson became a metaphor
for this entire complex

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.770
of relationships between
black people and police,

01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:44.170
and the criminal-justice system.

01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:49.970
And it becomes a kind
of Rorschach test.

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:52.300
Michael Brown is unarmed.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.400
He is fired upon by the police
officer

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.730
who says that he attacked him.

01:21:56.730 --> 01:22:01.600
There are varying eyewitness
accounts that dispute that.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.700
What is not in dispute is that
his body lays on the street

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:08.770
where he was shot
in the sweltering heat

01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:12.070
for multiple hours.

01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:13.700
&gt;&gt; What do we want?
&gt;&gt; Justice!

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.330
&gt;&gt; When do we want it?
&gt;&gt; Now!

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:16.970
&gt;&gt; What do we want?
&gt;&gt; Justice!

01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:18.530
&gt;&gt; When do we want it?
&gt;&gt; Now!

01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:19.530
&gt;&gt; What do we want?
&gt;&gt; Justice!

01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:21.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Night after night,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.970
the streets of Ferguson
were a war zone.

01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:27.600
(fireworks exploding)

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.870
(people clamoring)

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:35.630
The president remained silent.

01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:39.800
&gt;&gt; When Ferguson blew,
it exploded his inability

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.000
to grapple straightforwardly
with the issue of race.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.270
He was contorted and tragically
twisted

01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:51.470
when it came to, um,
to Ferguson.

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:53.500
&gt;&gt; The difficulty of this
situation for Barack Obama

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.300
is that it exposes him,
again and again and again,

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:59.300
to the most inflammatory thing
about his presidency,

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.530
with, you know,
the beer summit and Skip Gates,

01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:04.930
with Trayvon Martin,
and now with Ferguson,

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:06.900
that he is brought again
and again

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.930
back to this third-rail issue of
the disparities of race

01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:14.230
in this country.

01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:16.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Finally, after five days...

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:17.870
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.

01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:19.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: ...he went before
the press.

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.130
&gt;&gt; There is never an excuse for
violence against police

01:23:23.130 --> 01:23:26.930
or for those who would use this
tragedy as a cover

01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:29.870
for vandalism or looting.

01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:31.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He chose
a cautious route.

01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:33.900
&gt;&gt; ...hold ourselves to a high
standard.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:36.130
So, now's the time for healing,

01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:41.030
now's the time for peace and
calm on the streets of Ferguson.

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:43.500
&gt;&gt; He's trying to thread
this needle.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.270
And it feels as though both
sides end up

01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:50.430
being disappointed
by what he does.

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.130
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much, everybody.

01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:56.630
&gt;&gt; I was once interviewing Obama
in the White House, and...

01:23:56.630 --> 01:24:00.300
I asked him a question about
race.

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:07.570
And his answer was unusually,
uh... guarded.

01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:10.670
Inconsequential, and,
for journalistic purposes,

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:12.470
almost useless.

01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:18.070
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Later, as Remnick
was leaving the interview,

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:21.030
Obama stopped him
in the hallway.

01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:23.000
&gt;&gt; He says to me,
"You got to remember,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.030
I am the president
of the United States--

01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:31.870
I'm not the president
of black America.

01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:36.000
Everybody knows who I am, 'cause
they look, they can see me.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.730
I'm black.

01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:44.100
But anything I say on race,
anything I say on race,

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:48.500
I have to be extremely careful
and calibrated

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.470
in what I say."

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:53.670
(clamoring, horn honking)

01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:56.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And as the anger in
Ferguson grew out of control,

01:24:56.530 --> 01:25:02.830
on television, Obama remained
careful and calibrated.

01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:06.900
&gt;&gt; To those in Ferguson, there
are ways of channeling

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.470
your concerns constructively

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:14.230
and there are ways of channeling
your concerns destructively.

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:17.900
&gt;&gt; The split screen was the line
that showed his disconnect

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.270
with America.

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:21.070
One side of the screen, you're
seeing

01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:23.270
the nation's black president
begging that a city

01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:24.530
do not go up in flames.

01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:26.770
And the other side
of the screen,

01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:32.070
you're seeing young black people
saying, "We're done waiting.

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:34.800
We're not putting up with this
anymore."

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.270
&gt;&gt; We elect a black president,
and eight years later,

01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:38.900
we have this?

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.630
&gt;&gt; I remember talking
to activists who said,

01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.300
"I voted for Barack Obama twice,
and Trayvon Martin's still dead,

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.830
Michael Brown's still dead."

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:47.500
It was this sense that simply
having representation,

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:51.770
even at the highest levels,
didn't necessarily mean

01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:56.100
that these issues were going
to be addressed.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.500
&gt;&gt; He was really frustrated.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.800
And, you know, we would talk.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.200
And he would just say, you know,

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.300
"Well, cops need to stop
shooting unarmed black kids."

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.030
Like, that's what he thought.

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:08.900
But he also recognized
and was very disciplined about

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.470
the fact that he was president
of the United States.

01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:15.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The anger
transcended Ferguson.

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:21.800
Online, Black Lives Matter
emerged-- activists connecting,

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.300
sharing and uploading videos
of police killings

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.230
around the country.

01:26:27.230 --> 01:26:30.000
(shouting, guns firing)

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.600
&gt;&gt; I've been recording...

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.200
I've been recording.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.130
&gt;&gt; I can't breathe...
&gt;&gt; Get out of the car!

01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:37.400
&gt;&gt; Get that gun off of there.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.470
&gt;&gt; Shots fired!

01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:41.070
(radio squawking)

01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:42.470
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God!

01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:46.100
&gt;&gt; And within moments,
the entire world could see it.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.900
And it forced white Americans to
see things

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:51.430
that their eyes
never would have seen.

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:52.800
&gt;&gt; Black lives matter!

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.370
Black lives matter!

01:26:54.370 --> 01:26:56.430
Black lives matter!

01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:59.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Across the divide,
the blowback.

01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:01.100
&gt;&gt; They hate police officers.

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.900
&gt;&gt; Well, they have strong
feelings about...

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.770
&gt;&gt; No, they hate them--
they want them dead.

01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:06.970
They're a hate group, and I'm
going to tell you right now,

01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:08.930
I'm going to put them out of
business.

01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:11.130
&gt;&gt; Their agenda is, "It's okay
to go ahead and kill cops."

01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:13.530
&gt;&gt; No, nobody said that.
&gt;&gt; Oh, really?

01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:15.830
"Pigs in a blanket,
fry 'em like bacon?"

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:17.500
When they act like that,
they're criminals,

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.300
and they're calling
for the murder

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.670
of hard-working police
officers...

01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:21.930
&gt;&gt; I don't believe that.

01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:24.330

slime,

01:27:24.330 --> 01:27:27.230
this filth coming
out of these cop-haters.

01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:29.170
&gt;&gt; A Black Lives Matter protest

&gt;&gt; See, to me, dividing lives

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.100
that matter by color sounds
downright racist.

&gt;&gt; All was lost.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.230
It was our darkest moment.

01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:24.270
of undocumented immigrants,
but the move bypasses Congress.

01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:27.400
&gt;&gt; President Obama says the
Keystone XL Pipeline project...

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama's actions
energized his supporters,

01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:34.430
but provoked outrage on the
other side.

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:37.500
&gt;&gt; He couldn't get anything
through Congress, true.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:41.830
But the congresspeople represent
the American public.

01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:43.230
What did Obama do?

01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:44.830
"I take out my pen
and my phone."

01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:46.070
That's what he kept saying,

01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:47.370
"I'll take out my pen
and my phone,

01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:48.970
I'm going to do an end around
Congress."

01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:51.330
Meaning, "You people, I'm going
to do an end around you,

01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:52.900
the American public."

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.430
&gt;&gt; I've got a pen to take
executive actions

01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:57.470
where Congress won't,
and I've got a telephone

01:30:57.470 --> 01:31:02.700
to rally folks around the
country on this mission.

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.030
&gt;&gt; He gets shellacked.

01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:07.470
He loses the Senate, he shows
back up, he gets smoked,

01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:09.730
he calls a press conference,
and all, CNN and everybody,

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.930
"New York Times,"
"Is he going to listen

01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:13.270
to what the people are saying,
the country going

01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:15.070
in a different direction,
Obama going to listen?"

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:17.730
He gets up there and he goes,
"Okay, guys, here's how it is.

01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:20.200
I'm president of the United
States, and you're not."

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.170
He goes,
"Here's ten executive orders

01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:24.130
I'm going to sign immediately."

01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:26.430
I'm sitting there going,
"This guy's my role model."

01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:28.700
I said, "He just got smoked,
and he comes out

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.270
and hits you right in the mouth.

01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:32.300
This is a leader!"

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:35.300
&gt;&gt; The Constitution is going to
cease to exist as we know it.

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:37.370
Obama is going to start shooting
a BB gun at it.

01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:39.370
&gt;&gt; Where does this end?
Does it ever end?

01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:43.230
At what point do we roll back
this homegrown tyranny?

01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:44.800
&gt;&gt; ...executive order.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:47.600
What they are really are,
are imperial fiats.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.830
This is what we have to fear.

01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:50.200
&gt;&gt; And now he has to use
executive action,

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.800
and this is a very, very
dangerous thing.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:59.270
I mean, I think, certainly,
he could be impeached.

01:31:59.270 --> 01:32:01.330

&gt;&gt; Good morning.

01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:09.800
&gt;&gt; Everybody's saying I should
run for president.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.070
Let me ask you a question--
Meatloaf,

01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:13.330
should I run for president?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely!

01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:14.900
&gt;&gt; Now, you would definitely
vote for me.

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:16.300
&gt;&gt; I would vote for you,
in fact,

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:17.500
I'll, I'll help you with
your campaign.

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.730
&gt;&gt; What do you think...

01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:20.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was Donald
Trump's moment.

01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.030
&gt;&gt; Who would not vote for me?

01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:24.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The reality TV star
was making his move.

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:25.830
&gt;&gt; All right, good.

01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:27.800
&gt;&gt; A hot hint--
don't raise your hand.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.870
&gt;&gt; I would say, anybody
that raised their hand

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:32.030
would immediately be fired,
'cause they're stupid.

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:33.530
&gt;&gt; Trump is a showman.

01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:35.330
This is TV gold, right?

01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:36.800
Who would not watch this?

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.330
He's interesting,
and he's dynamic,

01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:40.400
and he knows how to work
the cameras.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.700
And he's been the number-one
show on NBC

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:44.430
for all these years
for a reason.

01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:47.200
&gt;&gt; Another political story
making news this morning:

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:50.970
Donald Trump's growing poll
numbers on a list of possible...

01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:53.000
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump's serious about
a run for the White House.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.200
Will...

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.470
&gt;&gt; ...Donald Trump, who may run
for president

01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:58.130
in the Republican primaries.

01:32:58.130 --> 01:33:00.670
&gt;&gt; Donald actually told me
in 2013

01:33:00.670 --> 01:33:02.070
that he was going to run for
president,

01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:04.570
and I thought he was kidding.

01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:08.200
And then he argued that it was
based on his Twitter feed

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.470
and Facebook posts-- that so
many people were posting

01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:13.600
on social media
that he should run,

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.200
that he thought maybe he should.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.730
&gt;&gt; As promised, Donald Trump
speaking now

01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:19.370
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire--
let's listen.

01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:21.630
&gt;&gt; You ready?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're ready.

01:33:21.630 --> 01:33:24.600
&gt;&gt; You get ready-- whenever
you're ready, I'm okay.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.030
&gt;&gt; He says to me,
"My effective television career,

01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:30.100
me as a television star is over,
I'm running for president"--

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.570
I laughed.

01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:33.430
Looked right in his face,
I laughed.

01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:35.100
(phone ringing)

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.070
And then he proceeded to tell me
that he had a, a base

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:42.070
of operations built
in the Trump Tower.

01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:44.170
That he had hired Roger Stone
and Sam Nunberg

01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:48.170
and Corey Lewandowski.

01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:50.170
&gt;&gt; You had a perfect storm.

01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:51.600
In almost 40 years
in American politics,

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:56.230
I'd never seen the voters
in this bad a mood.

01:33:56.230 --> 01:34:02.800
They were sour, very suspicious
of political institutions--

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:08.730
whether it's Congress,
whether it's the two parties.

01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:10.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump had used
the birther movement,

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:13.730
and now seized another
hot-button issue

01:34:13.730 --> 01:34:19.600
for the conservative base--
immigration.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.870
A top aide, Sam Nunberg,
helped him package it.

01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:27.100
&gt;&gt; Nunberg had realized that
this issue of immigration

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.130
has real salience with
Republican voters.

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:31.400
The problem they had was, they
couldn't get Trump

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:35.230
to stay on topic--
famously short attention span.

01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:37.270
And so Sam Nunberg came up
with this idea,

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:40.470
essentially a mnemonic device
to keep Trump focused

01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:43.170
on the issue of immigration.

01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:46.700
&gt;&gt; Next year...

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.330
&gt;&gt; So, I said, "Well, why don't
we say you're going to build

01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:51.630
a wall, because it's bigger?

01:34:51.630 --> 01:34:53.700
You're going to build a wall.

01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:57.370
And we'll, like... and you'll
get Mexico to pay for it."

01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:58.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump took it on
the road,

01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:01.630
testing out different versions
of the line.

01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:06.600
&gt;&gt; We have to build a fence,
and it's got to be a beauty.

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.970
Who can build better than Trump?

01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:10.530
I build; it's what I do.

01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:13.400
&gt;&gt; He said it in Iowa that day,
and the crowd went nuts.

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.600
You can watch it,
the crowd went nuts.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.570
&gt;&gt; If I run, I will tell you,
the king of building buildings,

01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:19.870
the king of building walls,

01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:21.600
nobody can build them
like Trump.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.600
That I can promise you.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:23.630
(crowd cheers and applauds)

01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.500
I can promise you that.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.570
&gt;&gt; He said to me,
"You know what?

01:35:28.570 --> 01:35:30.470
I'm talking about immigration,
I feel it.

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:32.170
Sam, this is a movement.

01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:33.300
This is a movement.

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:35.000
They, they get it, they get it."

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.030
(crowd cheering and applauding)

01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:39.130
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Obama had promised
unity,

01:35:39.130 --> 01:35:41.770
but as Trump announced
his intention to run,

01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:45.830
it was clear his candidacy would
be about exploiting division.

01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:50.600
(applause continues)

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.700
&gt;&gt; If you look at Sarah Palin
talking to "real Americans";

01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:00.830
the Tea Party talking about
taking the country back;

01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:03.700
the birther movement itself
that launched Trump;

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.830
by the time he came down
that escalator,

01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:12.800
he was the obvious Republican
front-runner.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.330
He was the guy saying the same
thing

01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:18.870
that they'd all been saying
on Fox and on talk radio

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:22.700
and on Breitbart for the last
six-and-a-half years.

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:27.170
&gt;&gt; When Mexico sends its people,
they're not sending their best.

01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:30.600
They're not sending you,
they're not sending you.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.000
They're sending people
that have lots of problems,

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.500
and they're bringing those
problems with us.

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.430
&gt;&gt; When he starts doing the
over-the-top stuff, and I go,

01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:42.630
I said, "You watch, they're,
they're going to bite hard,

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:45.270
and they're going to bite hard
and blow this up."

01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:48.130
&gt;&gt; They're bringing drugs,
they're bringing crime,

01:36:48.130 --> 01:36:52.070
they're rapists, and some,
I assume, are good people.

01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:54.900
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God, I said,
"This is ..." I said,

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.330
"He's just, he's just buried
every...

01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:57.870
They're going to go nuts.

01:36:57.870 --> 01:37:01.200
CNN is literally going to
broadcast 24 hours a day."

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.700

Mexican immigrants

take it back and say,

"Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that
Mexico's sending rapists;

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:18.300
they're sending Rhodes Scholars,

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:19.900

than we are."

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.730

back!
