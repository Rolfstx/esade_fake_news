00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.960
 March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization made an announcement. 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.960
 "During the last two weeks 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.600
 has the number of incidents of COVID-19 outside China 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.180
 thirteen times. 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.640
 COVID-19 can now be classified as a pandemic. " 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.650
 The coronavirus, or at least COVID-19, already has China, South Korea, Iran, and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 Italy overwhelmed. 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.080
 Thus, it is a warning to other countries where the virus is now spreading rapidly. 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:36.130
 Over the coming days and weeks, we expect the number of cases, deaths and countries 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.360
 which is accepted to increase. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.880
 The spread of COVID-19 is no longer something we can prevent. 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.020
 But this is something that can slow us down. 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.900
 We must eat now. 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.980
 Someone with COVID-19 usually develops fever, tiredness and cough. 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.900
 Cramps, pains and other moderate symptoms are also possible but are less likely. 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.500
 The severity of the symptoms varies. And some people infected with the virus 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.900
 may not show symptoms at all. 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.760
 In 80% of cases, people experience only moderate symptoms. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.160
 Although in 20% of cases, we see that the infection manifests in a more serious way. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.400
 Generally, 1 to 2% of known cases appear to lead to death. But that death rate is 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.400
 lower for young people, and much higher for the elderly. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.800
 The virus is also highly contagious - much more contagious than flu. 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.140
 After infection, it can take up to 5-6 days to feel ill and you 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.420
 symptoms first begin to appear. 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.780
 But you can already spread the virus to other people during that time, even if you feel healthy. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.140
 The moment people realize that they are sick, this is the time when they are 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.300
 the greatest risk is to light others. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.740
 This is why the virus is so effective in spreading around the world. 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.370
 So that's why the WHO now declares COVID-19 a pandemic. 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.040
 What they shared next is just as important. 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.360
 "We can't explain it any more seriously. 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.440
 All countries can still influence the rate of the pandemic. " 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 It depends on what each of us as an individual has to do. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.980
 In any hospital, the capacity to treat patients is limited by the number of beds the hospital has. 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.060
 Think about the number of beds in your local hospital at any given time. 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.870
 There are already a lot of patients receiving treatment for things like injuries they sustained during a car accident. 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.190
 Or, a stroke. 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.440
 The dot refers to one person who is healthy and decides to go out as normal. 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.740
 They hop on the train and go to the office. There they become infected with COVID-19. 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.200
 But they do not immediately feel ill, and may not feel ill for several days. 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.410
 Later, they decide to go out to a basketball game. 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.790
 Where they reluctantly infect two or three other people. 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.239
 Most people will have a relatively moderate case, but one person may be an elderly person 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.060
 whose case is going to be serious and who will eventually have to go to hospital. 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.560
 But the three, who are infected but who do not feel ill, will go out again. 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.180
 On the train and at the office and at work, several other people will be infected. 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.640
 Twenty percent of people will need hospital care. 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.792
 During the short period, repeat the process and the number of people who 

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:51.960
 should go to hospital every day. 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.690
 Soon, the hospital is full and the crisis begins. 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.620
 People with severe cases of COVID-19 cannot get treatment, 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.420
 and people who could be saved die. 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.099
 On top of that, people with other problems cannot be helped and some of those people also die. 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.140
 Suddenly there is a big boom in preventable deaths. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.690
 This is exactly what happened in South Korea, Iran and Italy, all of whom are 100 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.440
 after going over 5,000 cases in 2 weeks. 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.199
 Many people died because they couldn't get to the hospitals. 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.300
 The boom is made up of serious cases but it is done by people who are not 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.960
 feeling sick did not cause, they spread the disease in public. 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.280
 This means that people have the greatest impact on the prevention of unnecessary deaths. 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.000
 That means we can all prevent it. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.300
 Delaying the virus means that we must act as if we are already sick. 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.140
 Avoid public transport, the office, crowded places, even small gatherings of people. 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.300
 You can reduce your chances of infection and spread. 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.979
 This is called social descent. 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.139
 If enough people apply it, the virus spreads much more slowly. 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.800
 Over time, many people may still become ill but many will need hospitalization daily 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.389
 and fewer people are going to overwhelm the system. 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.759
 The trend line then becomes flatter, people can be treated and die less 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:11.830
 due to. 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.749
 These are the two ways the COVID-19 pandemic works. 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.339
 One only happens if everyone takes their side. 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:21.969
 This is why experts and officials are encouraging people to push the trend line through social 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.830
 abandonment, and stay home as much as possible. 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.749
 This is also why companies in the US help people by encouraging people to work from home 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:34.129
 even home and major sports matches were canceled at this time. 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.039
 It may seem drastic but it has worked before. 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.439
 In 1918, the cities of Philadelphia and St. Louis both had a severe flu pandemic, however 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.349
 both responded in different ways. 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.089
 In Philadelphia, health officials have allowed a big party to continue. 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:52.509
 While St. Louis closed schools, theaters and pubs. 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.780
 Philadelphia's hospitals are overwhelmed and many more people have died. 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.819
 St. Louis was able to prevent unnecessary deaths. 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.009
 One hundred years later, these are also the scenarios we have to share. 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.119
 The difference is not when you get coronavirus, but when you get it. 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.040
 It may mean the difference between life and death for you or someone you know. 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.120
 But we still have to act today.
