00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.440
Elon Musk thinks it's almost certain that we are living in a computer simulation.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.200
"There's a one in billions chance that this is base reality."

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.360
He says that humans are basically some advanced version of The Sims.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.840
Yes, that idea sounds pretty absurd.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.840
But we shouldn’t just write this off. People used to think the solar system worked like this. But almost 2000 years before Galileo proved it didn’t,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.720
Aristarchus of Samos posited the exact same, crazy idea. Reality is probably not as it seems.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.420
Musk is echoing a paper on this theory by philosopher Nick Bostrom. His argument goes like this...

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.580
“40 years ago we had Pong, like two rectangles and a dot.”

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.980
30 years after Pong, we got The Sims.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.980
“Now 40 years later, we have photorealistic 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it’s getting better every year.”

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.940
So let's go about 10,000 years into the future

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.940
It’s possible that when we get there, civilization will be entirely gone because there is a ceiling to our advancement.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.640
Maybe it’s because of global warming — or self-replicating robots.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.660
“...if civilization stops advancing, that may be due to some calamitous event that erases civilization.”

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.660
But another possibility is that if we keep advancing — and assuming everything in the physical world CAN be simulated —

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.620
eventually, we’ll simulate ourselves.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.420
Every synapse in entire human brain, for everyone on earth.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.000
Getting enough computing power to run billions of ancestor simulations could be a problem.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.800
But Bostrom thinks we’d send tiny, self-replicating robots to other planets, which would turn the planet into a huge computer.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.220
And some of the simulations would start making their own simulations.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.920
In this scenario, there are billions of universes that are indistinguishable from our own.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.320
That means, chances are, we are in one of the simulated universes.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.780
And given the other possibility —  which is human civilization has an inevitable ceiling — Musk thinks we better HOPE that we’re in a simulation.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.780
“Either we’re going to create simulations that are indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will to cease to exist. Those are the two options.”

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.980
There is one other —maybe future humans just don’t want to run ancestor simulations.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.980
Maybe they think it’s unethical, because there is a tremendous amount of suffering in the world. And that suffering would still feel real to simulated humans.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.100
Or maybe they have other priorities.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.100
So to recap, there are three possibilities. 1. Humans go extinct before we’re able to run a simulation this big.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.260
2.  Humans don’t run simulations because it’s wrong or boring.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.060
Number three, we are living in a simulation.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.020
Elon Musk thinks that there’s only a tiny chance we are in scenario 1 or 2 –

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.980
The philosopher Nick Bostrom thinks it’s more like a 20% chance that we’re in a simulation.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.280
But if you’re not into futuristic predictions, Bostrom thinks the argument also provides other rewards.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.440
He says, “It suggests naturalistic analogies to certain traditional religious conceptions.”

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.220
In other words, if we’re living in a simulation, there is a higher-level being — but it’s some version of us!

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.020
This leads to a rabbit hole of conversations, which is why Elon Musk has rules about when he can talk about this.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.260
“It got to the point where every conversation was the A.I.-slash-simulation conversation and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.580
and my brother and I finally agreed we would ban such conversations if we were ever in a hot tub.”
