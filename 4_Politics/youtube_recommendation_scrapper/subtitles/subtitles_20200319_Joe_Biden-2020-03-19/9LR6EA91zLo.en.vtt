00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.560
This might sound crazy, but after watching
hours of footage from the last several months

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.050
of debates and interviews, I say this with
confidence, Donald Trump is a master persuader.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.420
He gets how people make decisions and he speaks
in ways that influence people without them

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.759
even realizing how. So whether you love him
or hate him, there's a lot to learn from his

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.909
tactics, and if you watch till the end of
this video, you'll learn a ton, not just on

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.130
how to influence other people, but on how
you are influenced yourself. And before we

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.189
get started, I want to give out a shout out
to Scott Adams. He's been writing about Donald

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.679
Trump's persuasion for months and I owe him
for pointing out some of these tactics, so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.109
there's a link in the description to his blog
if you want to check it out. In the meantime

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.809
let's start with the double bind.

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.881
You said in September 30th that ISIS was not
a factor.

00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:41.701
Am I talking, or are you talking, Jeb?

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.241
I'm talking right now. I'm talking.

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:45.660
You can go back. You're not talking. You interrupted
me, Jeb.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.960
September 30th, you said it.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.079
Are you apologizing, Jeb? No. Am I allowed
to finish?

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.089
So let's take a look at this perspective on
Jeb Bush. Donald said, "Are you going to apologize?

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.730
No," answering for Jeb, so that gives Jeb
a couple of options. One, he can not say anything,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.290
but if he doesn't say anything, Donald has
already predicted that he's not going to apologize

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.600
for interrupting. Jeb loses, Donald wins.
Okay, option 2: He can interrupt Donald again,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.780
but Donald has already accused him of being
an interrupter so he looks like a jerk if

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.060
he continues to do that. Donald wins. Or,
he can apologize, in which case, Donald wins

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.219
again. All of the outs within the frame that
Donald has put on Jeb lead to victory for

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.070
Donald in this exchange. That is the power
of a double binder. There's no good option

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.520
here. The only way to deal with this if this
happens to you is to create a new frame, which

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.799
is probably a topic for another video. I don't
want to touch on it here, but let's look at

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.700
an example of another great double bind just
a few seconds later.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.520
Am I allowed to finish?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.979
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.800
Little bit embarrassing there, Donald.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.150
Now you're trying to build up your energy,
Jeb, but it's not working very well.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.420
There you go, another great double bind. Donald
has been taunting Jeb throughout these debates

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.429
for having low energy. So, in saying this,
what he does is either make Jeb looks like

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.880
someone who is reacting to Donald's taunts
as he tries to be more high energy, in which

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.020
case, Donald wins, or Jeb goes back to low
energy saying, "No, you can't control me,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.630
Donald." But then, Donald just gets the steam
rolling in the entire conversation anyway.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.860
These frames are constant ways that Donald
was able to assert power. He doesn't give

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.240
people other options, and he's been doing
this for years. Now, the double bind protects

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.790
Trump from downside, but how does he get his
ideas into your head? His most basic tool is

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.770
simple repetition.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.760
We need the toughness. We need strength.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.650
We need strength. We need tough people. We
need toughness.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.820
We have to be much tougher. We have to be
much stronger than we've been.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.080
you're a tough guy, Jeb, I know.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.210
When they called me today they were so apologetic.
They called me up this morning, they were

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.860
so apologetic.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.300
When they called me this morning, they were
apologizing.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.280
And then, the big granddaddy of all repetition;
I have never seen anything like this in my life.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.790
We don't win any more. We don't win any more
in our country, Shawn. We don't win any more.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.540
We used to win. We don't win any more. We
don't win with trade. We don't win with war.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.920
We can't even beat ISIS, and we're gonna win.
If I win, I will tell you, if I win, we all

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.820
win because we are gonna win.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.000
Now, you might be watching this and think
this is all silly. This couldn't possibly

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.480
be effective, and, if so, only on dumb people,
but it's actually extremely effective on all

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.030
human beings, that's why companies have jingles.
You see, we don't consciously know how we

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.600
form our opinions, but once something gets
into our head, we tend to defend it, regardless

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.950
of how it got there. So Donald Trump hammers
home these very, very simple ideas, and I

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.310
know that the next clip is from a movie. I
inserted it just because I think it's a fun

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.950
commonality, but it actually gets its right.
We, as humans, don't have any easy time with

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.850
complex facts and figures. It's these simple
ideas that take root in our brain.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.700
We need the simplest version of the idea in
order for it to grow, and, actually, in your

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.650
subject's mind, that's a very subtle art.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.760
So there you have it. Trump is following the
rules of inception and they work. Take a look

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.370
at this repetition combined with another favorite
tactic of Donald Trump--social proof.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.120
And everybody said I won at the debate, and
everybody said I won all six debates, and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.010
especially the last one, so everybody said
I won that debate.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.230
Every online poll said I won every one of
the debates, especially the last one.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.580
You get the idea, and that's just one interview.
Now, the focus on what everybody says is no

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.790
mistake. You may not have watched the debates,
but if you see even one interview with Trump,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.050
you walk away with the distinct impression
that everyone in the world thinks Donald Trump

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.519
won, and that's very, very powerful, because
when humans make a decision, we don't gather

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.439
all the relevant information and then make
a calculated decision. What we do is we look

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:25.250
to see what the herd is doing and then we
follow suit, and we do that especially when

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.050
we're overwhelmed with information, as we
are in non-stop coverage of elections, or

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.469
even sophisticated tech products, and Trump
knows this, so he's very, very careful about

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.550
avoiding negative social proof, as well. Check
it out.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.830
Now, a lot of people thought when you started
to run that this was a joke; that you aren't

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.659
going to get anywhere, that you were a buffoon.
You know it all, but now

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.210
I don't think they thought I was a buffoon.
What kind of a statement is that?

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.900
Well, some people did.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.349
I built a great company. I've had number one
best-selling books. I had one of the top television

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.210
shows in television, and nobody says buffoon.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.919
No, they thought I wouldn't run, and then
they thought that if I did run, I'd just have a

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.030
good time for a little while, and then, I'd
get out. Unfortunately for them, I'm number

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.159
one by many, many points.

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.310
So, you see, Trump is very protective when
it comes to what people are supposedly saying

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.030
about him, and he re-affirms his popularity
there at the end, but Trump doesn't stop there.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.860
He uses his special kind of social proof,
which is an appeal to authority, and this

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.669
is, basically, when he says that someone with
the prestigious title supports him. It doesn't

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.699
rationally argue his point, but the message
is received, and that is that smart people

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.770
support Trump. Check it out.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.889
Cut taxes 10 trillion dollars without increasing
the deficit. Let's be honest, is this a comic

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.749
book version of a presidential campaign?

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:43.249
Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot
of respect for, loves my tax plan, where reducing

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.310
taxes to 15%, we're bringing corporate taxes
down, bringing money back in; corporate inversions

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.770
So, you see here, Trump mentions this guy,
Larry Kudlow, but he also throws out some

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.419
numbers. This tax plan may or may not be good.
I'm not commenting on that. But what's interesting

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.120
is to see what happens when he's pressed on
this. He doesn't fall back on the merits of

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.279
the tax plan. He falls back on this social
proof and the appeal to authority. Take a look.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:10.029
You say that it would not increase the deficit
because you'd cut taxes 10 trillion dollars

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.900
and the economy would take off like, hold
on, hold on; the economy would take off like

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.740
a rocket ship.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.240
Right, dynamic.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.539
I talked to economic advisers who have served
presidents of both parties, they said that

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:22.080
you

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.919
That's another appeal to authority right there.
This is not a rational argument against Trump.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.180
You have as much chance of cutting taxes that
much without increasing the deficit, as you

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.340
would of flying away from that podium by flapping
your arms.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.259
Then, you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow,
who sits on your panel, who's a great guy,

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.639
who came out the other day and said, "I love
Trump's tax plan."

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.249
And he does the same thing when attacking
Ted Cruz on his ability to run for president

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:47.879
since he was born in Canada.

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:54.759
Lawrence Tribe and _ from Harvard, of Harvard,
said that there is a serious question as to

00:06:54.759 --> 00:07:00.029
whether or not Ted can do this, okay? There
are other attorneys that feel--and very, very

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:06.999
fine constitutional attorneys--that feel that
because he was not born on the land, he cannot

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:07.650
run for office.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.870
So you're starting to see here that rather
than putting together a rational argument,

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.529
which, by the way, the current debate format
doesn't even allow for, Donald Trump talks

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:20.219
to the part of our brains that actually makes
decisions. That part of the brain uses heuristics

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:24.729
like repetition, social proof, authority,
and another aspect of this part of the brain

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:29.949
is that it doesn't like large numbers. It
can't grasp statistics. Basically, it finds

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:35.749
anecdotal evidence like stories far more persuasive,
and Trump plays this up when asked for evidence.

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:39.689
He doesn't give rationally compelling evidence.
He gives emotionally compelling evidence in

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:41.819
the form of a story. Take a look.

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:48.289
What evidence do you have--specific evidence--that
the Mexican government is sending criminals

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:50.469
across the border? 30 seconds.

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:56.199
Border patrol--I was at the border last week.
Border patrol, people that I deal with, that

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:59.150
I talked to, they say, "This is what's happening."

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.699
When asked about his position on attacking
the family members of ISIS, he doesn't come

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.960
back with the stat, he comes back with more
anecdotes.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.960
We have people that know what's going on.
You take a look at just the attack in California

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.749
the other day. There were numerous people,
including the mother, that knew what was going

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:18.509
on. They saw pipe bombs sitting all over the
floor. When you had the World Trade Center

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:24.210
go, people were put into planes that were
friends, family, girlfriends. They knew what

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.289
was going on.

00:08:25.289 --> 00:08:28.710
And whether we like it or not, people are
going to find these anecdotes more persuasive

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.810
and more compelling than statistics, because
if you look at it, people lose their attention

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.210
when they're listening to someone rattle off
numbers. Take a look at Ben Carson doing it

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.950
in the worst way possible.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.070
If you're talking about a 18 trillion dollar
economy, you talk about a 15% tax on your

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:50.930
gross domestic product, you're talking about
2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to 3.5

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.640
trillion. But, if you also apply that same
15%...

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.980
In case you're wondering, not a single person
in the audience applauded for that response.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.750
Was it a good argument? Maybe, but it was
boring as hell. So I want to wrap this up

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.940
by saying that this video really isn't about
Donald Trump. All the politicians are trying

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.590
to do this. He just does it better, and the
reason that they're all trying is because

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:16.780
this is how humans, including you and I, make
decisions. The big takeaway here is to realize

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.770
that inception had it right. Ideas get planted
in our heads without us really knowing how,

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.560
and then we, backwards, rationalize them.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.650
The subconscious is motivated by emotion,
right? Not reason. We need to find a way of

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.920
translating this into an emotional concept.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.110
How do you translate a business strategy into
an emotion?

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.880
That's what we're here to figure out.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.390
So, no matter who we vote for, we are all
irrational, emotional decision-makers, and

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.460
when we understand this, we can better influence
others. Not only that, we can protect ourselves

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.260
from the strong personalities who influence
us, sometimes, to do things that aren't good

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.640
for us. So I hope that you've liked this video
and if you want to know more about the four

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.270
irrational, yet completely useful emotions,
to create a great first impression every time,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.930
anywhere, we created a video to show you those.
And in that video, you'd get the emotional

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.280
blueprint for creating that amazing first
impression on anybody--be it the CEO, a potential

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.710
friend, or, maybe, just someone that you're
interested in going on a date with. So, if
