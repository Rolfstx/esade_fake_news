00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.518
 "My purpose is to make sure 

00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:07.998
 All information will not disappear or be deleted. " 

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.810
 Voices from Chinese citizens like this are rare. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.540
 They are willing to speak out for government censorship 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.590
 Dissatisfaction with news reports about the new coronavirus. 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.527
 They asked for anonymity, 

00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:30.664
 Because of their behavior 

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.410
 It may expose themselves or their families to danger. 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.528
 But these people are part of this wave of citizen anti-censorship, 

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:38.610
 They strive to convey the information, 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580
 In a country where information review is so strict. 

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:46.290
 An account or message that requires free speech like this, 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.780
 It was quickly withdrawn from the Internet. 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.720
 Or a video like this showing people frustrated with life in isolation 

00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:03.240
 After being posted on the Internet, it was soon withdrawn. 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.600
 But, at least for now, 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.700
 This situation is undergoing some changes. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 Citizens are saving and reposting every day 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.770
 Information that the government does not want to publish. 

00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:22.040
 "I started collecting hundreds of screenshots. 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.805
 Later, because the outbreak was very serious, 

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:29.592
 I think keep this information or 

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:33.555
 It is very important to collect this information systematically. " 

00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:35.900
 Experts say they have never seen such a large scale 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.780
 Resistance to government censorship on the Internet. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.745
 "In the beginning, I just did it myself. 

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:44.610
 Now there are about one hundred people, 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.113
 We are constantly translating 

00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:50.910
 News articles and social media posts that are constantly being deleted. " 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.650
 Social media networks such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.430
 Already banned in China, 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.583
 But people who are proficient in the Internet use technology 

00:01:57.583 --> 00:01:59.645
 Let them review the content 

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:00.983
 Repost to these platforms, 

00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:03.480
 At the same time, it is not subject to surveillance by the authorities. 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.675
 They created an image archive database, 

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:09.206
 Save it like this video showing the overwhelming hospital, 

00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:15.406
 They also reposted personal videos that people shared: 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.480
 Some of them use some unexpected platforms, 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.270
 Including Github, which is generally used by programmers. 

00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:50.160
 Another taboo that Chinese citizens are challenging? 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.620
 They are publicly demanding free speech. 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.390
 This was triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.252
 He was the earliest whistleblower, he issued a warning about the virus, 

00:03:00.252 --> 00:03:02.760
 And was therefore punished by the authorities. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.430
 He died of the new coronavirus in early February. 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.013
 The night he died, 

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:09.772
 "I want freedom of speech" label 

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.179
 Started to become popular on Chinese social media site Weibo. 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.230
 Then, the government quickly started the review. 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.555
 "The subsequent review wakes us up, 

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:37.248
 Make us feel that the government will indeed censor the system 

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:40.745
 And suppress freedom of expression in the first place, 

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:46.360
 They did not admit that they had mistakenly admonished Dr. Li. " 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.793
 Dr. Li has become a symbol of freedom of speech, 

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:53.050
 In the competition between online censorship and citizens. 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.550
 So, who won? 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.610
 At present, citizens can also lead the censorship system of the authorities. 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.514
 However, the government â€™s new crackdown 

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:03.650
 May test the resistance of this network.
