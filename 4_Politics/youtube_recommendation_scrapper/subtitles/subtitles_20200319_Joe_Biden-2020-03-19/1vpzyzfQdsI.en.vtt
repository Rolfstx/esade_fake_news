00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This one is really good.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.840
“Who has been one of your mentors in comedy
that has helped shape who you are?”

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.000
Um… Actually, I have quite a few.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.760
Jon Stewart was one,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.480
Stephen Colbert,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.760
uh, Mike Birbiglia.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.240
Uh, but I actually have one that is here today.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.520
Please put your hands together for the one,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.160
the only Mr. John Mulaney, everybody!

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.400
John Mulaney, everybody. Let’s hear it!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.640
- Hello, hi.
- Uh, yeah.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.440
- How are you?
- Uh, I’m doing great.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.200
- Nice.
- Yeah.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.400
Do I look at you or them?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
You can– It’s…

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.240
It’s almost one of those like, weird–

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.840
You know how like, it’s the presidential debate,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.480
kind of, where you’re like,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.560
- playing–
- I’ve never run for President, but um…

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.760
- But if I do, I’ll remember that.
- Okay. Yeah.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.040
But I would look at my opponent
the whole time, I feel like.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.480
And be like, “What?
How could you say that about me?”

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.080
No matter who you were
like, standing next to.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.280
Yeah. I'd be in profile the 
whole time and be like,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920
“For real?”

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.280
- “Cory Booker, why would you say that about me.”
- “That's not true.”

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.800
So you have an amazing special
that's coming out December 24th...

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.680
- Yes.
- John Mulaney &amp; The Sack Lunch Bunch.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.280
Yeah, John Mulaney &amp; The Sack Lunch Bunch.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.200
It's a children's musical-comedy special.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.080
You– You guys know what that is, right?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.400
It stars me and, uh,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.640
- fifteen kids ages eight to thirteen.
- Okay.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.280
Um, and it's a general examination
of fear and anxiety, uh...

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.720
- with, uh, songs and sketches for kids and adults.
- Okay.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.040
Yeah, that was pretty beautiful.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.080
Alright, so people– 
people have asked how I know you, and–

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.440
- They've asked how you know me?
- How I know John Mulaney...

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.200
- Okay.
- The John Mulaney and–

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.920
We’re in the same field.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.960
- We have the same occupation.
- Yeah.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.160
But do you know there was a–

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.480
There was a very critical moment, where–

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.160
Like, in– In show business
you get so many sort of like, uh,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.440
phone-a-friend.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.400
But, I was getting ready for 
the Correspondents’ Dinner.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.160
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- And you're one of several people

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.680
- that I reached out to.
- Yes.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.960
But you're one of the only
people I reached out to–

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.080
Actually, one of two people
that I reached out to, personally

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.480
to come down and see the set.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.680
So I– I only had–

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.520
No, we only had 19
days to get it ready.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.760
- Yeah.
- And I remember calling you and–

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.560
You ever had, get that
anxiety when you're like,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.680
"Hey, we don't hang out that much,
but, I'm– I’m gonna– I’m asking you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.640
to physically be here,
so this is a big deal."

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.880
- Uh huh.
- And then...

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.880
I have that anxiety with
people I know really well.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.840
Oh, really?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.800
Okay, so I go,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.560
"Okay, I'm asking John to be here.
He's got Petunia, he's got a wife.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.920
Like, this is a lot. He's got to
come down to the Cellar and watch."

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.760
Thank you for factoring in my dog.
I appreciate that.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.920
- Yeah, yeah. Have to. And, uh–
- Yes.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.880
You don't know this, but you were–

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.640
We were texting back and forth
and you were like,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.920
"Hey, it's running 10 minutes late,
it’s running 15 minutes late."

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.880
Did you ever see the 1991 hit movie

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.000
Hook starring Robin Williams?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.520
- Absolutely I have. Yeah.
- Yeah. So–

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.880
Basically, the Peter Pan story–

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.440
- well they know, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.200
So, I kept telling Estee, I’m like,
"Hey, can you push me a little bit later?" like–

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.720
- Wait, I was running late?
- You were running late.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720
But you were living your life. And–

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.120
- No, that’s not fair though. 
- Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.520
- Hang on, let me get to the good part.
- No, I feel bad. Okay, get to the good part.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.360
Okay.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.400
Okay. So I go, “He's going to come”
and then– It was like, out of a movie. Uh...

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
where like, Liz is like uh,
"Last comic of the night,"

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.600
And I was, "Is, is– Is he gonna make it?"

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.440
And then you–
You run out of a rainy night,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.440
in New York City,
you run into The Olive Tree Cafe,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.160
and you're wearing like, this, uh,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.800
like, trench coat.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.880
- Trench coat.
- Yeah.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You come running in and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.880
you kind of like, tousled your hair
and you're like, "I'm– I’m so sorry, man. I'm late."

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.000
And then I– I literally for a moment I'm like,
"Dad came to the baseball game."

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.920
Remember in the beginning of Hook?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.200
- Yes.
- He doesn’t show up...

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.720
- …and like, this is his moment. Yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.760
- I threw my cell phone out the window,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.200
- And was like, “Hasan needs me."
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200
And then I went on to have like,
a mediocre set ‘cause we were still building it.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.160
My favorite thing about that was that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.800
I think I had a,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.120
a feeling that after you did it,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.400
you were going to do fantastic,
which you did. And I was really–

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.360
I was really proud of you
and it was really amazing to watch.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.200
But I also knew that people
were going to send you alcohol.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.600
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I don't drink. You don't drink.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.440
- I don't drink, no.
- And I don't drink not–

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.560
because I'm an alcoholic.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.800
And so I was, like,
"He's going to only get alcohol."

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.840
So I called the front desk and
I was, "Do you have like a fruit basket?"

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.840
And they were like, yes.
I was, like, "Send it up."

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.000
- Yes.
- Because everyone else is going

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.360
to send a bottle of scotch
and be like, "Good work."

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.480
- You did it, yeah.
- You did it, now...

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.720
begin drinking.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.960
And I devoured that fruit basket.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.680
There were so many bananas
and apples so thank you for that...

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.280
- There were bananas and apples? 
- Yeah.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.400
Oh, that’s great. Because
sometimes it's too much melon.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.520
Yeah. Or sometimes they give you
a pineapple but they don't give you

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.760
anything to deal with it.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.640
You know, I find with the cups that you
get in an average New York City,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.080
they call them delis, but they’re
just bodegas with food out exposed.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.400
And when you get a cup, a, fruit,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.640
- A cup fruit.
- A cup fruit, uh...

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.840
It's normally all melon,
all cantaloupe,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.840
one piece of pineapple,
one sliver of strawberry...

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.520
- And there’ll be like a grape.
- A grape!

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.920
- They’ll do a grape.
- Right at the top, a grape,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.560
- to cheat you, to tease you.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.080
Uh, tell us a little bit more about
the special and specifically

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.120
why you chose to work with kids.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.240
Okay. So, um, I wanted to do a
comedy special that wasn't stand up.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.120
Uh, why? I don't know.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.880
It's, uh, it’s one of my strengths, 
stand up, but I decided to deviate from it.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.520
And, I wanted to do, uh,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.600
something kind of like I grew up on,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.360
which was like, uh,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.840
Sesame Street and 3-2-1 Contact.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.400
- Yes.
- And Free To Be... You and Me.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.880
- Did you ever see Free To Be... You and Me?
- No.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.280
It was, like, an album and
then it was a TV special.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.600
And... did anyone here ever see
Free To Be... You and Me?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.920
Wow, okay.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.880
- No, a couple people said yes.
- A couple people said yes?

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.360
Okay. So it was just like,
there was no through line

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.800
and it was just songs,
a lot of them sung by adults being like,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.680
"It's hard to be a dad."

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.520
- And so I wanted—
- This is in the late ’80s, early ’90s?

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.480
This was in the late ’70s and therefore
I still got to see it around ’86.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.360
Got it, and they would play it
on like PBS or something that?

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.880
- Yeah.
- Got it.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.080
The way, like, Three's Company 
still played when I was a kid,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.720
even though it’d gone off
the air a decade before.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.360
- Right.
- So, I wanted to do something

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.360
where kids were just kind of like,
hanging out and like, talking with adults,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.720
’cause that's what
TV was when I was a kid.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.640
It wasn't the, uh, dog detectives
or whatever that is.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.560
- Right, right.
- Um, and...

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.480
I also have never really hung out
with 8 to 13 year olds since I was,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.000
like, 8 to 13.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.520
I didn't really want to do anything
about my childhood necessarily.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.680
- Um, I wanted to talk to kids in 2019.
- Yeah.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.720
And then I was writing sketches and songs
for them that were based on my childhood,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.080
and I said, well you're going to do whatever
I— you know, you’re gonna sing the song I wrote.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.600
- Uh huh.
- Uh, but it was like any actor,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.000
I was like, "You'll sing this song
and if you relate to it, you relate to it."

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.560
And I thought that kids in 2019
would be extremely different than

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.440
kids in 1989.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.400
Well, who do you think has it
harder? Because you hear that take, 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.800
“This generation, they're soft.”
There's that sort of…

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.600
- They're soft?
- Yeah.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.120
What are you talking about?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.920
The, like, the kids from
this sort of era–

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.760
you haven't heard this take?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.080
I've heard, oh, like, oh,
millennials you mean?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.360
Yeah, millennials and Gen Z...

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.680
Oh right? ’Cause they get
a participation trophy.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh how terrible.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.000
- Right.
- As you know, they, they crown—

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.040
as you well know, they crown
a prom king back in the day.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.040
- Right.
- Is there anything lamer than that?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.600
- That’s true.
- A participation trophy is just a nice banner.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.680
For some reason we would declare
someone royalty in the middle of like

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.640
a dry-humping convention
we were having.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.640
We go, “You– the most popular
kid already– are the king.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.640
And he'd be, "Thank you."
That was a soft generation.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.520
Um, no— these kids are,
I would say, and I'm no sociologist.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.040
- You know that.
- Sure.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.560
But I’d say kids are, uh,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.320
these kids are remarkably like, uh,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.440
moral and, uh,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.040
they're very considerate of others’ feelings...

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.040
without it being, like,
enforced that they should be.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.520
It seems internalized.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.120
Whereas I felt when I was a kid,
it was something I had to actively remember.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.480
Oh, that you have a
conscience or you're like…

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480
Yeah, just be, like,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.920
"Oh, no. Don't push."

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.960
- You know, like...
- Oh, right, right.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.600
They really had a sense of, like, uh,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.120
they really had empathy for each other.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.200
And they could really self-soothe, you know?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.720
I'd be like, “Your sketch is cut.”

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.040
And they'd be, "Ah, okay...

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.520
...well, if it’s better for the
show, that’s fine.” You know?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.960
- In real time?
- Yeah.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.240
- That’s incredible.
- And they had kind of a general,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.640
like, um...

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.720
yeah, they had a general moral compass

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.200
and I’m not,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.960
I don't know all of their religious backgrounds,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.520
but some of them seem to have
kind of like a secular, just moral compass.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.440
Whereas when I was a kid, it was like,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.160
"You'll go to Hell if you do that."

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.720
So I'd be, well, I'm not going 
to do that ’cause I'll go to Hell.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.920
But I would maybe like to do that.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.240
So I'd like to steal and do all these things.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.440
But, I won't just because of this fire penalty.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.600
Yeah, and they just had that naturally?

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.480
They just seemed to naturally know
that you shouldn't upset people and cause crime.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.960
- That’s incredible.
- Yeah.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.840
They were very considerate of each other.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840
Did you ever ask them about
the afterlife or like, Heaven or Hell?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.680
And were they just, “I've come
to terms with not knowing.”

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.200
Like, were they that sort of just stoically...

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.120
No, well it's interesting.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.360
Uh, one young man towards
the end of the special…

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.480
I interviewed them about their biggest fears—

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.280
- Yes.
- And those would become half hour discussions,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.040
- M-hm.
- Uh, just about, um,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.800
also anxiety for the future, what they had.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.200
And one young man towards
the end said, he said,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.120
"I worry about my friends and family dying."

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.040
And I said, “Do you do
 anything to comfort yourself?”

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.520
And he said, "Well, I know
that, uh, even if they're not here,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.200
they'll always be with me in my heart."

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.720
- And I was like... ahhhhh.
- Whoa.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.720
Whereas, when I was a kid,
they were like, "Grandpa's up there.”

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.880
- Right, right, right, right.
- You'll see him in 80 years."

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.240
And I'm like, "You're sure he is?"

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.560
And they were like, "Yeah,
he lives on a cloud now.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.880
Put on a suit. We're going to
the worst thing you've ever been through."

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.960
These are questions from the audience.
You mind if I ask you some of these?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.400
These were submitted before.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.200
- Oh yeah. Okay. Absolutely.
- Yeah, and they’re here tonight.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.800
Uh, Maddy, are you here?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.040
Maddy’s here.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.440
- Hi, Maddy.
- Maddy wrote,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.760
"John, this July I saw you in New York
carrying Petunia like a heavy sack

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.480
while looking very concerned.
Why were you carrying her like that?"

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.240
You saw that this July?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.720
I didn’t realize that it was you,
and I thought that it was a man

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.160
who had stolen a dog.
You were like this—

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.920
Because I was like that.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.720
- With her arms, like this here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.000
And you were looking around a lot,
and I didn't know it was you.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.600
It was like, "Oh no, that's definitely his dog.
That's the only dog I recognize other than mine."

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.920
Yeah. So, uh, my dog during the
summer in New York City likes to pull me

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.800
for as many miles as she can.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.080
And then she decides that she's tired
because she's a bulldog and she can't breathe.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.720
So she lays down.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.800
She can.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.600
She lays down on the ground
like a frog, and then I normally

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.440
pick her up and I go like,
"Come on, let's go." 

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.320
And if I drag..

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.240
If you drag a dog on the street...

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.160
And by the way, you can drag a bulldog
for as long as you want. Okay.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.560
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.960
- You're allowed to do that? You can do—
- No, these things are made of stone and they're like...

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.920
- They know what they're doing—
- Okay.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.760
And she knows. So I'll just be like, 
"Come on." And people are like,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.800
"Are you John Mulaney? You monster."

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.720
So, she probably pulled me…

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.040
Uh, for a while, she was taking
me towards like, those weird art galleries

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.160
 in Chelsea like, near the river.
And I was like, "Oh Petunia, come on."

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.520
You were going 11th Avenue.
You're going far away.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.880
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, oh don’t do that.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.760
Because I'd go, "Hey, let's cut west today."
And she’ll— I'll throw her off the scent

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.600
of what she likes, and she goes,
"This is a nice area."

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.880
She'd pull me for hours.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.760
So I'd pick her up and carry her rather
than drag her, because when I drag her,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.600
which by the way is fine, uh,
people would be like, 

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.640
"Why are you hurting Petunia?"

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.240
And I'd be like,
"She's hurting me."

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.000
So then I carry her right?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.280
So now how do you carry her?
Okay, she's hot, right? July in New York.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.080
Okay, so if I put her over my shoulder,
she's then just breathing into my ear.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.400
Like, “Hehhhhh.”

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.520
Some nights on the street...
Some nights on the quiet streets in,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.720
like, the East Village we'll 
be walking and it'll be really—

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.400
you know, it’ll be like a quiet night.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.880
And we'll be walking behind
someone for a little while.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.280
And gradually Petunia will just
gain on them and be like,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.160
“Hehhhhh.”

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.120
And you see these people slowly be like,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.160
 "Is there a monster behind me?"

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.120
Do they do the check?

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.480
- They have to check—
- Uh, yeah, then they turn around and they laugh.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.440
- Oh, boy.
- Because it's a piglet gargoyle.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.640
This is from Easha.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.320
Is Easha here?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.240
E-A-S-H-A.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.840
- Oh, hi, Easha. How are you?
How do I pronounce that? Is it...?

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.440
Easha. But you hit it with the A after the E.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.400
Yeah, the A is, like, silent I guess.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.760
Oh, that's wild. Okay.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.600
This is from Easha.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.560
"What is the worst Christmas
present you've gotten?

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.280
Oh. Oh, okay.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.920
Um, my grandmother, uh, who's alive,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.120
um, I don't know why...

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.840
that's not...

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.480
That's not the only thing about her.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.440
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, wonderful woman.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.560
Lived a full life. Anyway, she's alive.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560
- Anyway.
- Okay.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.800
So, um, she gave us all socks
one year and um, that was...

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.840
They were not, like, nice socks.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.640
They were like...

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.640
You know you, like, you just get,
like, black socks for like a…

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.760
- Oh, the CVS socks. Kind of like those?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.400
- Yeah.
- The way like, when like,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.800
you get a suit for a costume and they
staple the socks to it and you're like, “All right.”

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.920
- I know what you’re talking about. Yeah.
- So, uh, so we were like, "This is weird."

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.160
We were like, "This is a bad... This is weird."

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.120
Black dress socks. We're talking 
about the gold toe on the heel?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.040
Yeah. Just like, you know, just right next
to the like, reading glasses you get

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.600
at Duane Reade. Like just socks.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.800
- I know exactly what you're talking about.
- And we were all looking at them like,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.160
"This is so weird."

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.240
And maybe, "I hope she's okay." You know?

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.920
And then we all kind of, I don't know,
threw them away or something.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.360
- And then she—
- Not that day. You didn't do it that day?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.360
Uh, I think we did probably in the
paper... In the huge paper.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.280
- They were socks.
- Oh my God.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.800
- She lives in Boston. We're in Chicago.
- Uh huh.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.120
She's never... If… Worst case scenario,
we'd run out and get identical ones.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.480
And then she called up later that day
and said, "Merry Christmas,"

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.560
as you do, and we said,
"Merry Christmas." And she said,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.240
"Did you find the money in the socks?"

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.320
And we were like,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.200
"What's wrong with you?"

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.040
Were you like, were you like,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.840
"How much?"

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.200
Yeah. We were... Yeah, then we had to
be like, "Yes," and then had to temper like,

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.440
"How much was it and how
much should we be thanking her?"

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.800
It was like, "Yes, we found it.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.160
It was generous?"

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.840
But that was not the worst gift.
But I think the, uh, the duplicitousness of it,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.520
if I may make up a word, was what was…

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.200
 - stands out in my memory.
- Got it.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.240
Did you ever find out how much it was?

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.920
- It was $20.
- Really? Okay.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.760
All right, this game is going to be really fun.
We've never done this on Deep Cuts.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.960
Um, this game is called Truth or Text.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.320
So basically, I'm going to ask you a question.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.080
- It's a tough one.
- Okay.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.760
And based on this, you can either
choose to answer the question

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.480
or you can avoid
answering if you let me 

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.560
text anyone in your
phone anything I want. 

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.600
So–

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.160
Wait.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160
Does that premise make sense?

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.520
No, that's a really good game.
Wait. That's a really good game. 

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.920
- It's Truth or Dare, but–
- I'm trying to think what the question

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.400
would be that would make me rather—

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.280
That would force your hand.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.480
...that I would rather go, 
“Text anyone in my phone anything you want.”

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.880
- Okay.
- Uh, but—

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.200
...surely you've thought of some. Okay.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.840
All right.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.040
You're on a sinking ship with Lorne Michaels—

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.920
Okay, you can text—

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.640
For real? Okay.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.920
So you, for real, what do you do?

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.560
You’re serious.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.280
Unlock the passcode and
I will legitimately text anyone—

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.560
“Unlock the passcode.”

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.600
My face will do it.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.480
- All right.
- Okay.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.040
- All right. You do that.
- Yes.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.160
And then I get a text
anybody on the phone.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.600
Do you go through
other things on the phone?

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.320
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.400
I'll do contacts first. I'm not
going to look through text messages.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. Here we go.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.320
- And any... All right, you know?
- Yeah, I know.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.240
- Like if anything weird happens, don’t do it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.040
You're enough of a good guy, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.760
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.680
You got some good ones, man.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.280
Who are you interested in?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.880
- Oh. Hannibal B.
- I’m not going to do Hannibal. No, no.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.880
I like that it's still saved as Hannibal B.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.200
Yeah. Hannibal B (Chicago comic). That's weird.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.480
- What are you in the... You're only in the Cs?
- I'm only in the Cs. I got to... Here we go.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.000
- We're going to go with the big one.
- Ooh.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.760
- Can I?
- [Clears throat]

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.520
- I picked Dad.
- Okay.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.360
- No, no, no. It's—
- Because I wanted high... I wanted high stakes.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.800
- No. Yeah, you're a good man. So—
- No, no, no. Now I feel bad.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.200
- No, no, no, you know what?
- I feel bad. I feel bad.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.280
No, no, no, don't. Don't. Don't.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.280
You know, I'm just thinking
through the amount of...

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.400
the amount of follow
through I'll have to do.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.480
- You’ve met my dad, too.
- Yes, I have.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.880
Yeah.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.720
- Yes, I have.
- Yes, you have, yeah.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.920
Well we got to D, and from A to D I was like,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.920
"This is really good."

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.920
Okay.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.000
Pete Davidson has six numbers by the way.
That's insane.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.560
And none of them are the current one.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.400
Okay.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.880
Oh, you can see—you’re gonna see
the last message from him.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.720
Okay, all right. 

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.360
Send message. 

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.840
As if it would be scandalous.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.040
It's from my dad, like...

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.440
Okay.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.560
- All right.
- What?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560
Okay.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.920
“Do you have a minute—”

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.640
Oh my God.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.920
“...to talk about anti-vaxx movement?”

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.800
“I've just learned a lot about it—”

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.480
“...and it seems like
something you'd be into.”

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.760
Now you recall that your
sister works at his law firm?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.360
Correct.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.520
Not anymore. She left. She left.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.120
Ah.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.880
I wonder if—no. 

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.400
What—No.
I was just going to think for a second. 

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.280
What if he was like, "I haven't
told anyone, but I am anti-vaxx."?

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.200
John.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.680
Yeah?

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.320
Can I just say this to you as a friend?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.440
- What?
- Totally, like, jokes aside.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.600
- What?
- You got to text your dad back.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.360
- Why?
- He's shooting, he's shooting-

00:17:59.360 --> 00:17:59.880
- Oh.
- He put up—

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.160
- He put up three— He put up four jumpers.
- Oh, okay. Yeah. All right.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.240
Oh yeah. "Hi. Greatly
enjoyed the Conan interview."

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.880
- Pass him the ball back.
- Aww. Okay. Yeah, I should have texted him.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.560
I mean, this is going to...
This is going to force his hand.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.080
And now I have to... Okay.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.160
Do I have to wait to
tell him what happened?

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.680
- What this is? Yes.
- Okay, great. Great.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.240
So, your special is a
variety show that involves music,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.680
- children, comedy, everything.
- Yeah.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.000
And it's called
John Mulaney &amp; The Sack Lunch Bunch.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.880
Yes.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.800
I actually did a crossover
video with a bunch of desi teens.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.600
Yes.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.120
It was Hasan Minhaj
and the Tupperware Teens.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.000
Basically just brown children who grew
up taking Tupperware to school for lunch, 

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.400
and then we just talked about, like, the pain
and angst that they had to deal with—

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:42.800
Yeah.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.960
... and they're here with us tonight.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.760
Everyone put your hands together.
Guys, come on up on stage.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.560
Guys— this is John Mulaney, you guys. 

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.480
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi! 

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.320
- Good.
- Oh my gosh. 

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.680
Good, nice, nice.
Oh, thank you very much.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.400
So, these guys had a
bunch of questions for you.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.480
Okay.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.680
And, uh, they wrote them down.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.640
- They'd like to ask you some questions.
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.320
- So Abeer, why don't you ask— yeah. 
- Hi, Abeer!

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.400
Hi.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.880
My name is Abeer Khan.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.400
I am 13 and I'm from
Yonkers, New York.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.320
All right. Yeah. Nice.
Very nice. Very nice.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.960
First question.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:26.040
At what age did you realize your head
was always going to be too big for your body?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.520
Preschool? So, I was four years old. 

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.520
I have a school photo
where it's, like, just teetering. 

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.120
It's a tiny Lacoste shirt and
a neck and then this huge head.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.320
So, I was four years old.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.200
Oh wow.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.240
So my name is
Jena Adya Dookie and my question is,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.560
why do old, well, adults
always look so unhappy?

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.720
- Yes, okay.
- Yeah.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.960
I don't know what it is, okay.
Adults... And I learned this...

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.120
Did you go through your wedding
photos and notice a lot of people were like...

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.960
- Yeah. Like you mean—You’re talking about—
- Okay. Like ‘cause people—

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.600
older, not older I mean even our age—
resting face becomes not as like… 

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.840
you know, it's like… 

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.640
And so now at weddings, cause it
happens, it just gradually slacked.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.440
It's this, the thing where you're like your
face is like that, that's going to go away. 

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.880
So, it slackens. 

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.200
Now at weddings,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.720
if I think the photographer's
in range, the whole time I'll be like... 

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.880
And my wife's like,
"You look like a psychopath!"

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.000
And I'll be like,
"But, the photos will turn out well!"

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.560
Right.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.080
When you flip through and see all your friends,
in like– squinting in the sun, just like…

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.960
And they're... I know they had a good
time, but you know, there's no evidence.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.200
Hi, I'm Teji Yijayakumar. I'm 17,
and I'm from Yonkers, New York. 

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.320
My question was, what's something that
adults didn't warn you about getting older?

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.080
Oh.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.960
Oh, uh, like constantly
being hotter– like body heat.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.120
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.960
Just like this. Like ahhhhhhh...

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.360
- That whatever.
- Yeah, temperature, temperature.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.360
Just general body temperature.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.080
General— body temp
fluctuations based on stress.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.080
Well, I'm Suhani Madan.
I'm 15. And my—

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080
Are you from Yonkers?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:16.880
No, I'm from Manhattan.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.240
- You're from Manhattan?
- I’m from here. Yeah.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.960
Yeah, you didn't say it
’cause you didn't want to rub it in. 

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.280
So my question is,
do you know Russell Peters?

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.160
Um, I...

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.880
A small smattering begins.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.320
- I've met Russell.
- Okay.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.080
- Uh, at The Cellar.
- Okay.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.640
- But do I know him?
- Yeah?

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.360
- No!
- I mean, this is big for the desi teens. 

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.520
- I know, but do you know him?
- Yeah. Of course!

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.600
Well then, be impressed with that!
I don't, I don't—

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.960
Although I've met him.
Does meeting mean you know someone?

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.960
- I think so. That counts.
- By adult standards or children standards? 

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.480
- Okay, if we passed each other on the street—
- Yeah. 

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.240
...we'd be on...we'd say hello.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.080
- Gotcha.
- Right?

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.120
- Yeah!
- Okay.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.160
Yeah, I'm very close
with Russell Peters.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.480
Alright, so my name is Sahir Mir. 

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.400
Where are you from? What borough?

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.440
I'm from– actually from
Princeton, New Jersey.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.240
- Oh, okay.
- I’m not from here.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.040
And I'm 16 years old.
Uh, so my question is, uh, 

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.360
what are you going to do
when you're not funny anymore?

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.120
No, no. This is a very good question. 

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.920
Wait. Being funny is not
like having an ACL that's not…

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.720
I think it goes in waves.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.280
You really think that, like, you got
12 good years in you, you know, like…

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.320
- You mean I had or have?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.280
- Like, it started with The New Kid,
- I don't know.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.840
- and let’s see how long...
- I don’t… 

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.000
New in Town and...

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.760
- you've got maybe a decade and—
- I like they said New Kid— 

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.760
- Yeah, sorry.
- just pushing them all together.
 

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.640
- Kid Gorgeous. Yeah, yeah.
- That’s my own fault. 

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.400
- New Kid Gorgeous in Town.
- New Kid Gorgeous in Town. 

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.280
Um, I… so like… 

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.680
but don't you think there'll be a dip? 

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:58.920
I'm thinking like 50 to 60,
like, uh, not funny. 

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.280
60… 

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.600
...getting funny again.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.160
75 to 90, I am going to be so funny.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.400
I feel everything
about me is going to click.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.880
- Everything will all click together.
- Yeah, it'll finally makes sense.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.640
Got it.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.040
But from 50 to 60,
what do comedians do? 

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.600
I'll try, I'll be on, like, whatever
the equivalent of The Good Wife is.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.080
- Sure. Recurring character.
- I'll be like...

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.160
- "That's disgraceful!" you know?
- Right.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.280
And ah...

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.480
And then, you know, I'll ride that out and
then I'll be a funny old man in a tuxedo.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.200
Got it. 

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.280
What would you do if you went bald?

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.920
Oh, very slim chance of that.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.960
You know that for sure?

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.640
Well, are you supposed to
go by your mother's father?

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.080
You're supposed to
go by your grandfather.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.200
- Yeah.
- On your mom's side.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.440
- No one in my family lost their hair.
- Okay.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.120
So if I go bald,
I did something wrong. 

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.760
What do you mean if I lost my hair?

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.960
Do you mean in terms of,
uh, coverage or just open-ended?

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.800
Just open-ended.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.240
Okay. Here's what I would do.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.800
I would, in the beginning, go full…

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.360
not hairpiece, not hair system.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.000
- Full toupee. Like full—
- Oh, no! No, no, no

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.600
- And I would see.
- You don't want the toupee. No.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.480
I know, but I would see— 

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.560
- I would invite all of yous over to dinner.
- Sure.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.920
You, Hannibal B., everyone,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.800
- And I would just, I would see...
- Everyone? 

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.600
- if friends...yeah, yeah.
- Maybe Dad? Who knows.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.200
I want to, I would like to just
show up and see if friends just— 

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.640
and it would be kind of purple-ish.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.320
You know how they
can't match brown hair? 

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.200
Yeah, right.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.640
And I will just see if my friends say
anything and I'll do that for like a month.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.120
It would be aggressive, too.
Toupees are so aggressive.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.280
- A full toupee in this day and age—
- Do you guys know what a toupee is?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.440
Yeah.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.800
Abeer, you know
what a toupee is, Abeer?

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.640
Kinda, yeah.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.520
- What do you think it is?
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.240
It's kind of? Or you do?

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:50.880
Kind of.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.400
Okay. What do you think it is?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.240
Like, an old man wig?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.720
They can sometimes
be as simple as like just— 

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.160
as simple—

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.720
it can sometimes be just that…
they can sometimes fill in that part. 

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.880
But there are those,
uh, there are those few,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.280
who have decided to wear full wigs,
uh, that cover their entire head...

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.680
...in a hairstyle and
hair that is not their own. 

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.680
Uh, Phil Spector was one of these.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.920
He was a music producer
and he, uh, did many things, 

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.360
and now he's in prison.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.840
But he was very–
he did a lot before that.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.360
Well, this story is actually,
it bridges us to our next game.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.640
So, you know, me and the Tupperware
Teens were children of immigrants. 

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.080
We grew up here. Our parents
got here around the ’80s, ’90s. 

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.480
So, a lot of our pop culture
references start there. 

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.840
So, in India, the number of American
pop culture references that you know…

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.240
Yeah.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.000
Like, for example, for my father,
it's kind of, it's Michael Jackson, 

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.800
Tom Cruise, uh...

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.520
...and I think probably Tom Brokaw,
 when he first got to the States.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.360
- Oh, interesting!
- You know what I mean?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.840
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- There's only five people...

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.080
So, this game is called, 
Why Are People Obsessed With This?

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.840
Okay.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.960
Now the older I've gotten,
um, and the more I've assimilated, 

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.680
I've just started to ask people,
"What's the deal with this person?" 

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.320
And we all kind of
have these references—

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.160
- And we want to ask you...
- Okay.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.520
...so you can contextualize that for us.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.600
So, let's start this off.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.800
Bruce Springsteen.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.560
Okay.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.840
Explain it to me.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.560
Oh.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.960
Like why?

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.560
Really?

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.760
For real. For real.
I went to go see him on Broadway. 

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.720
Jon Stewart obsessed
with Bruce Springsteen.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.400
I remember seeing it on
Broadway and I was like, "What?" 

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.960
There's this guy with the raspy voice,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.360
"Man, we were just kids...”

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.840
“...trying to get to the city.”

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.760
“...We look past that bridge and…”

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.360
- “...there was a sleepy town behind us.”
- That generally—

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.680
- I go, "Why is this dude...?"
- Yeah.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.720
Because that
generation of Baby Boomers

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.720
rebelled against their
parents and they played Frisbee 

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.960
and they thought that ended
the Vietnam war and it didn't.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.360
And then they like–
their parents passed away

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.080
and their brains broke

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.800
and they became so
nostalgic for this fake nonsense.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.640
I'm not—

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.600
- I like Bruce Springsteen.
- Is he a good artist?

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.320
- I think he's a good artist.
- I don’t even know.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.520
Yeah, he's got great songs,
but his whole thing of like,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.000
"I got a ’52 Chevy."
It’s like, you never did!

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:12.960
Right. Okay. Okay. 

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.120
I’m all Billy Joel, who is just like,
“Hot dogs are fun!” You know?

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.000
And he's good?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.960
- Billy Joel?
- Billy Joel’s great? Okay.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.560
Yeah. I'm more, if you were
to divide them into two camps,

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.520
I'd be Billy Joel over
Bruce Springsteen.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.640
So, Bruce Springsteen is American
men who have never done manual labor, 

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.800
in their lives, turning that
song on and feeling that they have.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.560
Got it. Okay.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.400
Abeer, why don't you go?
Who do you got?

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.880
Okay, I have Goldie Hawn.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.720
Goldie Hawn?

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.320
Okay.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.440
Well, Goldie Hawn came on the
scene in a show called Laugh-In,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.760
which apparently was funny,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.040
and it was in like, the late ’60s
and she was in like, a bikini. 

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.160
And like, that was the show. Yeah.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.880
And people were like,
"This is groundbreaking!"

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.960
But it was just very misogynistic. 

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.480
And they would have like, uh, like,
it was like, it was like hippies and stuff,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.880
and they'd have swirly colors.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.640
So, again, Baby Boomers,
they liked her a lot. 

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.600
And then, um,
and then, Goldie Hawn...

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.760
How do you feel about Goldie Hawn?

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.440
- I like her! Because...
- Okay.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.360
...she's always been like,
"Hi!" You know? 

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.000
She's always been
here and that's fun.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.600
And, uh, she's married
to Kurt Russell, is that right?

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.040
Jena, you had one though, right?

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.600
Jimmy Buffett.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.280
Good. Keep it. Don't correct there.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.800
You need not know.
I don't know. I don't know.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.240
Why are people
obsessed with Jimmy Buffett?

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.360
I don't know. I don’t know. 

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.400
He has one song that those of us
who know who he is, know this song. 

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.240
He has full concerts, apparently,
where other songs are played.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.000
I don't understand it.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.440
I think it's like, for people
that like, like, barbecuing.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.200
And, yeah.
You needn't bother investigating.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.880
I have Richard Gere.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.800
Richard Gere?

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.560
- Yes.
- Gere.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.760
Um, I don't know.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.080
Like, I was kind of young for that.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.160
He was in a movie
called American Gigolo.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.440
And I think he was the first... 

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.960
He, like, he would like,
squint and people liked that.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.480
Like, for me, like,
it was Pretty Woman. 

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.160
I remember being
a kid and they're like,

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.560
"Hey, this is Richard Gere!"

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.800
- And I go, "Okay."
- Yeah, yeah.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.600
But I didn’t— I remember that too.
And I was like, “okay...” you know?

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.240
They're like, "Julia Roberts!" And
I was like, "I don't know who that is!"

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.360
And they were like, "And Richard Gere!"
And I was like, "Again, I don't." 

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.520
Uh, I guess they– by Hollywood
standards, he was “off-beat” looking,

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.800
which means he was
incredibly handsome.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.040
Gotcha. Teji, why don't you go.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.720
Um, I have Stevie Nicks.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.880
Stevie Nicks. Oh! Well— 

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.400
- This is a big deal. For well—
- This is a big deal?

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:55.680
Well, I asked Stevie Nicks to be in my
children's special and, uh, she said no...

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.640
and she was unavailable,
but also it was passed along to me

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.800
that she didn't like the material.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.960
And I said, "Oh, that's okay.
You know, unavailable was fine."

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:12.520
Stevie Nicks is like, if your mom
picked you up in the car

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.920
and like, was like,
"Ugh." Like, "Another day."

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.800
And then she'd turn on Stevie Nicks.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.080
She would then be
transported to a magical world 

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.480
where she was a sorceress of sorts.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.720
And so, to a lot of
our mothers roughly—

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.560
and a little younger than
me— mothers’ generation.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.840
This was like, they
put on a song called like, 

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:37.280
“Bella Donna” and
they would go to another place

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.360
and that's why she matters.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.480
Sahir, why don't you go?

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.400
Yeah, I don't
understand Barbara Streisand.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.920
You don't understand
Barbara Streisand?

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.040
Why did that
provoke such a response?

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.080
- This is why we can't be open about it!
- I can't,

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.920
- People are all like, “Oh, Barbra Streisand.”
- I can’t imagine a less...

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.320
- Yeah.
- not less sympathetic person,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.680
but I can't imagine a
person who would elicit

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.880
fewer “awws” than Barbara Streisand.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.400
Yeah.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.720
Oh, Barbara Streisand, yeah, okay.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.400
Who is she? Why are
people obsessed with it?

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.520
And why is us not
knowing about it a problem?

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.280
So, like, tons of people were Jewish,

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.440
but... 

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.640
...like, no one had ever been
like, "I'm the star!" You know?

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.520
And people were like, "Okay."

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:26.040
And, uh, she was a good
singer, really young, I believe.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.960
And she was like, um,

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.640
like 40 when she was 18.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.160
Is that fair? I think that's fair.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.360
And then she was, like, an icon.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.480
Like, I don't think there was ever a
time where she wasn't an icon.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.080
So, she's been beloved since—

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.520
I think like, when she
was like, like, she was in like, 

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.800
Funny Freckles or
something, I don’t even know.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.320
And she was like, people
were like, "That's a star." 

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.080
And she wasn't even—
you know what they did to her?

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.360
Is they pulled her out of
her own generation, too.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.560
So, they were like you're for old
people and for people your age.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.680
And so she's just been
pulled back and forth

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.800
and she has a shopping
mall in her basement.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.760
That's not a lie. She has a
mall, but— that is a free to her.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.400
But she goes into the shops.
She lives in Malibu.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.360
That is a strange fact. John, do you
have any questions for them?

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.600
What advice do you
have for a 37-year-old?

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.360
Try not to act too young
’cause it's just weird.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.240
No offense! No offense!

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.280
- No offense! I didn’t mean it like that.
- Maybe take the jacket off.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.040
- That um...
- There's no way we're going to top that.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.840
- The Tupperware Teens, everybody!
- Thank you, Tupperware Teens.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.480
You guys can head
back there. Thank you.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.120
One more time for Mr. John Mulaney!

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.760
Thanks, everybody.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.880
John Mulaney &amp;
The Sack Lunch Bunch 

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.720
comes out December 24th
only on Netflix!

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.640
- Bye, buddy. Thank you.
- Thank you, man. Really, that was so—

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.520
- I need to go call my dad.
- Really?

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.280
Yeah, yeah.
