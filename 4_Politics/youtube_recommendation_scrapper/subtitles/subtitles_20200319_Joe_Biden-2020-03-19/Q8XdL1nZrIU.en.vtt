 Once upon a time--

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.230
George Washington
era-- there was a team

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.090
called the Brooklyn Dodgers.

owned the Dodgers

 So this is what we do.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.660
Right now-- unbelievable-- under
the Controlled Substance Act,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.600
marijuana is at the
same level as heroin.

essentially legalizes marijuana

all over this country.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.230

we do, move to expunge

the records of
those people who've

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.370
been arrested for marijuana.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.280
And the third thing we do, which
is really important, I think--

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.860
as we move toward the
legalization of marijuana,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.990
I don't want large
corporations profiting.

in the legal marijuana business
