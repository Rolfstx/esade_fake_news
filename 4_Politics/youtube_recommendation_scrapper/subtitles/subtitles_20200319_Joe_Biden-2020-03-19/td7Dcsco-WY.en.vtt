00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.680
Matt Yglesias: This is a really sort of big
picture question, but over the years, I've

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.900
heard a number of different members of your
team refer to your kind of philosophy in foreign

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.030
affairs as realism.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.620
Is that a term you would use?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.080
Barack Obama: You know, traditionally, a lot
of American foreign policy has been divided

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.410
into the realist camp and the idealist camp
and so if you're an idealist you're like Woodrow

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.869
Wilson and you're out there with the League
of Nations and imagining everybody holding

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.800
hands and singing Kumbaya and imposing these
wonderful rules that everybody's abiding by.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.610
And if you're a realist, then you're supporting
dictators who happen to be our friends and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:50.910
you're cutting deals and solely pursuing the
self-interest of our country as narrowly defined.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.970
And I just don't think that describes what
a smart foreign policy should be.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:10.380
I think it is realistic for us to want to
use diplomacy for setting up a rules-based

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.330
system wherever we can, understanding that
it's not always going to work.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.810
If we have arms treaties in place, it doesn't
mean that you don't have a stray like North

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.890
Korea that may try to do its own thing.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.170
But you've reduced the number of problems
that you have and the security and defense

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.950
challenges that you face if you can create
those norms.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.510
And one of the great things about American
foreign policy in the post-World War II era

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.640
was that we did a pretty good job with that.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:52.120
It wasn't perfect, but the UN, the IMF, and
a whole host of treaties and rules and norms

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.750
that were established really helped to stabilize
the world in ways that it wouldn't otherwise

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.750
be.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.720
Now I also think that if we were just resorting
to that and we didn't have a realistic view

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.429
that there are bad people out there who are
trying to do us harm and we've got to have

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.170
the strongest military in the world and we
occasionally have to twist the arms of countries

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:21.490
that wouldn't do what we need them to do if
it weren't for the various economic or diplomatic

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.150
or in some cases military leverage that we
had.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.040
If we didn't have that dose of realism we
wouldn't get anything done either.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:40.560
So what I do think what is accurate in describing
my foreign policy is a strong belief that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.260
we don't have military solutions to every
problem in the 21st century.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.410
That we don't have a peer in terms of a state
that's going to attack us and bait us.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.090
The closest we have obviously is Russia, with
its nuclear arsenal, but generally speaking

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.420
they can't project the way we can around the
world.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.700
China can't either.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.880
We spend more on our military than the next
ten countries combined.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.880
&nbsp;

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.920
So the biggest challenge we have right now
is disorder.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.560
Failed states.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.819
Asymmetric threats from terrorist organizations.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.650
And what I've been trying to do is to make
sure that over the course of the last six

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.760
years and hopefully the next two, we just
have more tools in our tool kit to deal with

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.000
the actual problems that we have now and that
we can project into the future, rather than

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.080
just constantly relying on the same tools
that we used when we were dealing with Germany

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.510
and Japan in World War II.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.370
And so ending two wars was important, not
because I was under any illusions that that

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.940
would mean we wouldn't have any terrorist
threat.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.910
It does mean, though, that by not having 180,000
people in Iraq and Afghanistan, we can then

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:08.210
more strategically deploy, with a smaller
footprint, special forces, trainers partnering,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.170
that allows us to get at the actual problem
and then frees us up to be able to send a

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.470
team to prevent Ebola.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.040
To double down on our investments in things
like cyber security.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.740
To look at the new threats and opportunities
that are out there.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.770
And that, I think, has been the real challenge
over the last six to eight years.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.180
Matt: So in the Middle East, where we're still
very much engaged despite the draw down from

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.180
Iraq.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.670
The Clinton Administration had a policy they
called Dual Containment of Iraq and Iran.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.370
The Bush Administration had an idea about
preventative war and about rollback and Democracy

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.370
promotion.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.550
Under your administration, the country is
still very involved in that region, but I

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.900
don't think we have as a clear a sense of
what is the sort of strategic goal of that

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.900
engagement.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.110
Obama: Well, partly it's because of the nature
of what's happened in the Middle East.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.130
I came in with some very clear theories about
what my goals were going to be.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.090
We were going to end the war in Iraq.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.080
We were going to prevent Iran from getting
a nuclear weapon, trying diplomacy first.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:26.760
We were going to try to promote increased
economic development in the Muslim countries

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.530
to deal with this demographic bulge that was
coming into play.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.370
We were going to promote Palestinian and Israeli
peace talks.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.060
&nbsp;So, there were all kinds of theories.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.470
And then the Arab Spring happened.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:46.690
I don't recall all the wise men in Washington
anticipating this.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:56.979
And so this has been this huge tumultuous
change and shift and so we've had to adapt

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:03.550
even as it's happening in real time to some
huge changes in these societies.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:13.020
But if you look at the basic goals that I've
set: making sure that we are maintaining pressure

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.070
on terrorist organizations so that they have
a limited capacity to carry out large-scale

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.340
attacks on the West.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.520
Increasing our partnering and cooperation
with countries to deal with that terrorist

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520
threat.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.540
Continuing to prevent Iran from obtaining
a nuclear weapon.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:37.660
And using the tool of sanctions to see if
we can get a diplomatic breakthrough there.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:46.470
And continuing to try to move the Israeli
-Palestinian relationship into a better place,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.900
while at the same time helping the region
as a whole integrate itself more effectively

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.120
into the world economy so that there's more
opportunity.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.960
Those basic goals still hold true.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:09.330
But what people rightly have been concerned
about that the forces of disorder â€“ sectarianism,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:18.070
most tragically in Syria, but lingering elements
of that in Iraq as well, the incapacity of

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:28.199
Israelis and Palestinians to get together,
and the continued erosion of basic state functions

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:37.350
in places like Yemen, mean that there's more
to worry about there than there might have

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.380
been under the old order.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:46.669
We're kind of going through a passage that
is hard and difficult, but we're managing

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:56.100
it in a way to make sure that Americans are
safe and that our interests our secured and

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:08.320
if we can make progress in restoring a functioning
multi-sectarian Iraqi government, and we're

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.039
able to get a diplomatic breakthrough with
Iran, then we have the basis I think for a

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:16.960
movement towards greater stability.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.070
But this is going to be a generational challenge
in the Muslim world and the Middle East that

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.180
not only the United States but everybody's
going to have to deal with.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:31.330
And we're going to have to have some humility
in recognizing that we don't have the option

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.579
of simply invading every country where disorder
breaks out.

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:43.950
And that to some degree, the people of these
countries are going to have to, you know,

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.389
find their own way.

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:47.740
And we can help them but we can't do it for
them.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.869
Matt: It seems to me, on that point, that
members of your administration often seem

00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:57.519
acutely aware of sort of the ideas of limits
of American power, maybe to a greater extent

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:01.720
than they always feel comfortably articulating
publicly.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.779
Is it difficult to say, in the political and
media system, that there are things that you

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:09.279
can't really do?

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.279
&nbsp;

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.820
Obama: Well...

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.939
American leadership, in part, comes out of
our can-do spirit.

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:21.220
We're the largest, most powerful country on
earth.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.649
As I said previously in speeches: when problems
happen, they don't call Beijing.

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:27.649
They don't call Moscow.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:28.649
They call us.

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.800
And we embrace that responsibility.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.589
The question, I think, is how that leadership
is exercised.

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:48.550
My administration is very aggressive and internationalist,
in wading in and taking on and trying to solve

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.830
problems.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.830
&nbsp;

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:56.660
Where the issue of limits comes in is what
resources do we devote that are going to be

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.779
effective in solving the problem.

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:08.829
So, in Iraq, when ISIL arises, if you think
you have no constraints, no limits, then I

00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:16.260
have the authority as commander-in-chief to
send back 200,000 Americans to re-occupy Iraq.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.100
I think that'd be terrible for the country.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.529
I don't think itâ€™d be productive for Iraq.

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:27.389
What we've learned in Iraq is you can keep
a lid on those sectarian issues as long as

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:34.769
we've got the greatest military on earth there
on the ground, but as soon as we leave, which

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:38.450
at some point, we would, we'd have the same
problems again.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:45.100
So what I said was Iraqis have to show us
that they are prepared to put together a functioning

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:51.369
government, that the Shia majority is prepared
to reach out to the Kurds and Sunnis, and

00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:57.710
that they're credibly willing to fight on
the ground, and if they do those things, then

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.720
we can help and we're going to have a 60-nation
coalition to do it.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.550
So, if you look at that strategy, yes, it
acknowledges limits.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:10.310
It acknowledges that its a bad idea for us
to, after 13 years of war, to take over a

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.129
country again.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.899
But that doesn't mean we're not engaged, and
it doesn't mean we're not leading.

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:23.279
And so, I think the real challenge for the
country not just during my presidency but

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:30.809
in future presidencies is recognizing that
leading does not always mean occupying.

00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:36.180
That the temptation to think that there's
a quick fix to these problems is usually a

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.839
temptation to be resisted.

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:47.730
And that American leadership means wherever
possible, leveraging other countries, other

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.619
resources, where we're the lead partner because
we have capabilities that other folks don't

00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:53.600
have.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:01.100
But that way there's some burden-sharing and
there's some ownership for outcomes.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.779
And many of these problems don't get solved
in a year or two years or three years.

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:12.790
&nbsp;I mean, the Shia-Sunni split in the Middle
East right now is one that has been playing

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.470
itself out over centuries.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:20.660
We have the opportunity, I think, to lessen
those tensions and to lift up voices that

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:26.220
are less prone to exploit those sectarian
divides, but, you know, we're not going to

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.170
eliminate that stuff overnight.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:39.249
The trend towards extremism among a small
segment of Muslim youth in the region, that's

00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:44.569
a trend that's been building up over a period
time in part because of broader demographic

00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:50.019
problems and economic problems in the region,
partly because of a perverted ideology that's

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:54.029
been hypercharged through the internet.

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:58.319
It's winning the hearts and minds of that
cohort back.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.230
That's a multi-year project.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:07.589
And so in the mean time, you take the victories
where you can, you make things a little bit

00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:15.439
better rather than a little bit worse, and
that's in no way a concession to this idea

00:13:15.439 --> 00:13:19.790
that America is withdrawing or there's not
much we can do.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.739
It's just a realistic assessment of how the
world works.

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:27.470
Matt: You seemed to resist the realist label
earlier, but when you talk about your goals

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.949
earlier, you seem very concerned about disorder
and you didn't mention anything like democracy

00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:38.619
and human rights and the country you mentioned
partnering with, it's places like Egypt where

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:43.820
they came to power in a military coup, Saudi
Arabia, with public beheadings, Bahrain, where

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:49.709
during the Arab Spring they were beating nonviolent
demonstrators and repressing that violently,

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:54.040
do you have any concerns about those sort
of long term sustainability of those kind

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.040
of partnerships?

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.670
Obama: This is a perfect example, Matt, of
where the division between realism and idealism

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.670
kind of breaks down.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:08.810
I think any realist worth their salt would
say that any society that consistently ignores

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:13.670
human rights and the dignity of its citizens
at some point is going to be unstable and

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.279
not a great partner.

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:24.279
So it's not just the right thing to do, it's
also very much in our interest to promote

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:28.420
reforms throughout the Middle East.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:40.019
Now, the fact that we have to make real time
decisions about who are we partnering with

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:45.629
and how perfectly are they abiding by our
ideals, and are there times where we've got

00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:51.649
to mute some of our criticism to get some
stuff done, are there times where we have

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:58.209
an opportunity to press forward, that doesn't
negate the importance of us speaking out on

00:14:58.209 --> 00:14:59.209
these issues.

00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:03.279
As I said during the State of the Union speech
and as I've said in any speech that Iâ€™ve

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:08.779
made in the Middle East or anywhere else in
the world, it just means that we've got to

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.579
do more than one thing at a time.

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:18.899
We need a strong bilateral relationship with
China to achieve a bunch of international

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:25.629
goals like climate change that are of great
national security importance to us and billions

00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:27.510
of other people.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:33.119
That doesn't mean it's not smart for us also
to speak out about censorship and political

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:34.209
prisoners in China.

00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:37.769
We have to do both those things and there's
going to be some times they come a little

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:41.100
more into the fore than in other times.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.619
And the same is true in the Middle East and
elsewhere.

00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:51.410
But I am a firm believer that particularly
in this modern internet age, the capacity

00:15:51.410 --> 00:16:04.999
of the old-style authoritarian government
to sustain itself and to thrive just is gonna

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:06.129
continue to weaken.

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:10.720
Itâ€™s gonna continue to crumble that model.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.399
My argument to any partner that we have is
that you are better off if you've got a strong

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:22.980
civil society and you've got democratic legitimacy
and you are respectful of human rights.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.019
That's how you're going to attract businesses,
that's how you're going to have a strong workforce,

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:34.509
that's how ultimately you've got a more durable
not-just economy but also political system.

00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:39.600
But in those conversations, I'm also going
to acknowledge that for a country that say

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:48.790
has no experience in democracy or has no functioning
civil society or where the most organized

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:57.459
factions are intolerant, you know, religious
sects, that progress is going to be happening

00:16:57.459 --> 00:17:01.699
in steps as opposed to in one big leap.

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:12.180
And that's, I think, the goal of any good
foreign policy is having a vision and aspirations

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.510
and ideals, but also recognizing the world
as it is, where it is, and figuring out how

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:26.620
do you tack to the point where things are
better than they were before.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.620
That doesn't mean perfect.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.390
It just means it's better.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:41.130
The trajectory of this planet overall is one
toward less violence, more tolerance, less

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.540
strife, less poverty.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:50.100
I've said this before and I think some folks
in Washington were like, "Oh, he's ignoring

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.710
the chaos of all the terrible stuff that's
happening."

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.260
Of course, I'm not ignoring it.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.340
I'm dealing with it every day.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.210
That's what I wake up to each morning.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:04.900
I get a thick book full of death, destruction,
strife, and chaos.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.216
That's what I take with my morning tea.

00:18:06.216 --> 00:18:13.290
Matt: &nbsp;Do you think the media sometimes overstates
the level of alarm people should have about

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.020
terrorism and this kind of chaos as opposed
to a longer term problem of climate change

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.280
and epidemic disease?

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.690
Obama: Absolutely.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.970
And I don't blame the media for that.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.590
What's the famous saying about local newscasts,
right?

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.630
If it bleeds, it leads, right?

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:37.640
You show crime stories and you show fires,
cause that's what folks watch, and it's all

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.640
about ratings.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:47.870
And, you know, the problems of terrorism and
dysfunction and chaos along with plane crashes

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:54.270
and a few other things, that's the equivalent
when it comes to covering international affairs.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:19:01.600
There's just not going to be a lot of interest
in a headline story that we have cut infant

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:09.350
mortality by really significant amounts over
the last 20 years or that extreme poverty

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:19.500
has been slashed or that there's been enormous
progress we set up when I first came into

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:26.970
office to help poor farmers increase productivity
in yields.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.620
It's not a sexy story.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:36.470
And climate change is one that is happening
at such a broad scale and at such a complex

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:41.910
system, it's a hard story for the media to
tell on a day-to-day basis.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.290
Look, the point is this: my first job is to
protect the American people.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:52.440
It is entirely legitimate for the American
people to be deeply concerned when you've

00:19:52.440 --> 00:20:00.020
got a bunch of concerned when you've got a
bunch of violent, vicious zealots who behead

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:10.620
people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks
in a deli in Paris.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:18.570
We devote enormous resources to that, and
it is right and appropriate for us to be vigilant

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.800
and aggressive in trying to deal with that.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.470
The same way a big city mayor's got to cut
the crime rate down if he wants that city

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.520
to thrive.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:35.310
But we also have to attend to a lot of other
issues and we've got to make sure we're right

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:41.110
sizing our approach so that what we do isn't
counterproductive.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:47.470
I would argue that our invasion of Iraq was
counterproductive to the goal of keeping our

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.090
country safe.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:21:01.160
And despite the incredible valor of our troops
and I'm in awe of them every single day when

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.740
I work with them, you know, the strategy that
was crafted in Washington didn't always match

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.310
up with the actual threats that were out there.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:16.810
And we need to make sure that we're doing
the right things and doing those well so that

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:22.730
we can also deal with future threats like
cybersecurity or climate change or different

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:28.190
parts of the world where there are huge opportunities
but before I came into office, we had neglected

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.420
for quite some time, Asia Pacific being a
perfect example.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.370
Or our own backyard, the Western Hemisphere,
where there's been real progress in Latin

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:42.410
America and we've got the opportunity to strengthen
our relationships.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:48.530
But there are also some big problems like
Central America where, with a relatively modest

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:53.180
investment, we could really be making a difference
and making ourselves safer.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:59.410
Matt: So there's this idea of a pivot to Asia
and what does that mean to you in specific

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:00.410
terms?

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:06.680
A transfer of hard military resources, a transfer
of time on your agenda in the national security

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.680
council?

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.480
Is it something you've really managed to pull
off or does the Middle East really still have

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.660
us kind of sucked in?

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.650
Obama: I think it means all of the above.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:19.620
Look, Asia is the fastest growing region in
the world, the most populous region in the

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:29.280
world and you've got the largest country in
the world, China, that has undergone this

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.490
incredible, dramatic transformation over the
several last decades.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:40.350
How well America does, economically, from
a security perspective, is going to be linked

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.030
to our relationship to that region.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:49.850
So we've said, a) we've got to make sure weâ€™ve
got a constructive relationship with China,

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:56.280
one that is hardheaded enough to make sure
they're not taking advantage of us, but also

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:05.790
sends a message to them that we can create
a win-win situation as opposed to a pure competition

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.120
that could be dangerous.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.790
And in order to do that, China, you've got
to step up and help us underwrite these global

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.060
rules that in fact help to facilitate your
rise.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:25.920
Things like free-trade rules that are fair
and maritime rules that don't allow large

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.650
countries to bully small ones.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.170
So that's one big piece of it.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.620
A second big piece of it is making sure that
our allies like Japan and South Korea feel

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:39.540
confident that we're always going to be there
and that our presence is not one that over

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.420
time wanes, because they're looking at a really
big neighbor next door.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.010
They want to make sure that if America is
their key partner, that America is going to

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.700
stand with them through thick and thin.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:56.080
Then you've got all these smaller countries,
or countries that are developing, and are

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.820
coming into their own in the South Pacific,
in SouthaEast Asia and what we see there is

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.280
this enormous hunger for more engagement with
America.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.950
They want to do more business with us.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.620
They want to have more defense cooperation
with us.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.900
And what we've been able to do over the last
six years is to have systematically build

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:23.020
this set of relationships and strengthen trading
platforms, strengthen security cooperation,

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:30.440
everything from how we deal with disaster
relief, so if something like what happens

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.150
in the Philippines happens in other countries
can work more robustly and weâ€™re building

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:40.620
resilience to how we're dealing with deforestation.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:46.430
All these things are areas where we've made
an enormous investment and there have been

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.830
significant payoffs.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.880
Matt: You mentioned the Philippines, and earlier
the idea that there are big gains potentially

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.840
to be made by giving some assistance to Central
America.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.050
Does it really make sense to have so much
of America's foreign aid going to a country

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:07.530
like Israel that's quite wealthy when there
are other democratic allies in other regions

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.220
in the world that seem maybe more in need
of assistance?

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.940
Obama: Well, our relationship with Israel
is in many ways unique.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.500
It's our strongest ally in the region.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.130
Our people-to-people ties are unmatched.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:31.730
And partly because of world history, the vulnerabilities
of a Jewish population in the midst of a really

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.520
hostile neighborhood creates a special obligation
for us to help them.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:45.210
I think the more interesting question is if
you look at our foreign assistance as a tool

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:55.830
in our national security portfolio, as opposed
to charity, and you combined our defense budget

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:01.530
with our diplomatic budget and our foreign
assistance budget, then in that mix there's

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:07.700
a lot more that we should be doing when it
comes to helping Honduras and Guatemala build

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:16.050
a effective criminal justice system, effective
police, and economic development that creates

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.050
jobs.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.620
Matt: So you're saying it would make sense
to reallocate those resources?

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.940
Obama: Well, and part of the challenge here
is just public awareness.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:29.840
Time and time again, when they do surveys,
and they ask people what proportion of the

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.830
foreign budget is spent on foreign aid?

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.210
They'll say, â€˜uh, 25%â€™.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:41.470
They're pretty sure all their hard-earned
money that they pay in taxes is somehow going

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.240
to other folks.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:51.791
And if we can say, it varies between 1-2%
depending on how you define it.

00:26:51.791 --> 00:27:03.730
And if we were to make some strategic investments
in countries that really could use our help,

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:09.940
we would then not have to deploy our military
as often and we would be in a better position

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.790
to work with other countries to stand down
violent extremism.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:20.960
Then I think people could be persuaded by
that argument, but we haven't traditionally

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.450
talked about it in those terms.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:29.780
It's one of the things I'd like to do over
the next couple of years is to try to erase

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:37.010
this very sharp line between our military
efforts in national security and our diplomatic

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.040
and foreign assistance efforts.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.720
Because in this environment today, we've got
to think of it all in one piece.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:51.030
Matt: The transformation and growing prosperity
in China is really probably the biggest story

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.180
of the times we're living through.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.400
And it's something that it seems to me as
something that causes a lot of anxiety to

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.540
a lot of Americans.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.260
You know, we've been having our own economic
struggles, but also from a geopolitical standpoint,

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.140
it's a country with a very different political
system, with very different values.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.400
Is this something that you think people should
regard as alarming?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.660
Obama: No, we shouldn't alarm at it.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:19.420
In fact, we should welcome China's peaceful
rise.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.630
Partly from just an ethical perspective.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:31.160
To see hundreds of millions of people rise
out of dire poverty and be able to feed their

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.580
children and have a decent home.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.550
That's a good thing and we should encourage
it.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:44.380
In addition, a China that is disorderly is
a big problem because there are a lot of Chinese

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:54.090
in the world and if they're not doing well
and they're unstable, that's very dangerous

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.520
for the region.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:03.500
Where Americans have a legitimate reason to
be concerned is that in part this rise has

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:09.320
taken place on the backs of an international
system in which China wasn't carrying its

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:17.180
own weight or following the rules of the road
and we were and in some cases we got the short

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.320
end of the stick.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.730
This is part of the debate that we're having
right now in terms of the Trans-Pacific partnership,

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.010
the trade deal that, you know, we've been
negotiating.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.950
There are a lot of people who look at the
last 20 years and say, why would we want another

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.930
trade deal, that hasn't been good for American
workers?

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:42.480
It allowed outsourcing of American companies
locating jobs in low-wage China and then selling

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.920
it back to WalMart and, yes, we got cheaper
sneakers, but we also lost all our jobs.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.750
And my argument is two-fold.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:57.510
Number one1: precisely because that horse
is out of the barn, the issue weâ€™re trying

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:05.790
to deal with right now is can we make for
a higher bar on labor, on environmental standards,

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:10.610
et cetera, in that region and write a set
of rules where it's fairer because right now

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:16.270
it's not fair and if you want to improve it,
that means we need a new trading regime.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:20.309
We canâ€™t just rely on the old one because
the old one isn't working for us.

00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:24.290
But the second reason it's important is because
the countries weâ€™re negotiating with are

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.740
the same countries that China is trying to
negotiate with.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.700
And if we don't write the rules out there,
Chinaâ€™s going to write the rules.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:40.500
And the geopolitical implications of China
writing the rules for trade or maritime law

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.620
or any kind of commercial activity almost
inevitably means that we will be cut out or

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.420
we will be deeply disadvantaged.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.260
Our businesses will be disadvantaged, our
workers will be disadvantaged.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:31:02.550
So when I hear, when I talk to labor organizations,
I say, right now, we've been hugely disadvantaged.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.530
Why would we want to maintain the status quo?

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:09.610
If we can organize a new trade deal in which
a country like Vietnam for the first time

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:14.720
recognizes labor rights and those are enforceable,
that's a big deal.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.341
It doesn't mean that we're still not going
to see wage differentials between us and them,

00:31:20.341 --> 00:31:22.670
but they're already selling here for the most
part.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:27.810
And what we have the opportunity to do is
to set long-term trends that keep us in the

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.700
game in a place that we've got to be.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.730
Matt: Why is you think that you haven't been
able to persuade your friends in the labor

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.730
movement of that?

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:39.350
They presumably look at these issues pretty
closely, they know the interest of their members.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:48.929
Obama: Well, look, the story, the narrative,
the experience that people have seen over

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:54.010
the last 20 years, that's a real experience,
that's not something we deny.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.929
That's why during the State of the Union address,
I was very explicit.

00:31:56.929 --> 00:32:01.510
I said, look, not every trade deal has lived
up to the hype.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:08.120
And there are real gaps in the current trading
regime that means there are a whole lot of

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.970
Toyotas sold here and almost no Fords or Chryslers
sold in Japan.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:20.080
But what I say to them, if in fact, the current
situation disadvantages us, why would we want

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.530
to stick with the current situation?

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:28.370
Now, sometimes their response will be well,
what you're doing isn't enough, what we need

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:35.910
to do is to have union recognition in Vietnam
or we need Japan to completely open its markets

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.059
and not have any barriers whatsoever and we
need that immediately.

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:41.809
And I say, well I can't get that for you.

00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:48.690
But what I can do is make the current situation
better for American workers and American businesses

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.100
that are trying to export there.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:56.390
I can open up more markets than what we have
open right now, so that American farmers can

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.650
sell their goods there.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.510
And, you know, better is better.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:05.190
It's not perfect.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:11.210
Those experiences that arose over the last
20 years are not easily forgotten, and the

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.880
burden of proof is on us then to be very transparent
and explicit in terms of what we're trying

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.190
to accomplish.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:22.620
It's similar to the challenge we've got on
the Iran negotiations.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:28.340
And maybe I'll close with that point because
that's been an issue of great interest.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.210
People are right to be suspicious of Iran.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.500
Iran has sponsored state terrorism.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:42.050
It has consistently, at the highest levels,
made deplorable anti-Israeli statements.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:52.360
It is repressive to its own people and there
is clear and unavoidable evidence that in

00:33:52.360 --> 00:34:00.000
the past they have tried to develop a weapons
program and have tried to hide it from view.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.040
So that's a given.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:08.169
And it's understandable why people are concerned,
both here and around the world.

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:16.649
But what I've also said is that the deal that
we've struck, this interim deal brought about

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:23.349
by the tough sanctions regime that we put
together, offers us our best opportunity to

00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:29.839
solve the problem of a nuclear Iran without
resort to military force.

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:35.529
Iran is negotiating seriously for the first
time and they have made, so far, real concessions

00:34:35.529 --> 00:34:38.019
in the negotiations.

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:43.579
We have been able to freeze the program, for
the first time, and in fact roll back some

00:34:43.579 --> 00:34:49.539
elements of its program, like its stockpiles
of ultra highly enriched uranium.

00:34:49.539 --> 00:34:56.619
And so, for us to give an additional two to
three months to exhaust all possibilities

00:34:56.619 --> 00:35:03.609
of a diplomatic resolution when nobody denies,
including our intelligence agencies, and Mossad

00:35:03.609 --> 00:35:10.119
and others, nobody denies that Iran right
now really is abiding by the terms of our

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:11.690
agreement, so weâ€™re not losing ground.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:17.789
They're not surreptitiously developing a weapon
while we talk, for us to give two three months

00:35:17.789 --> 00:35:22.349
to figure that out, makes sense.

00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:26.960
Now, same thing with respect to trade.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.740
You're going to meet some folks who are going
to be skeptical and their impulse is going

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.640
to be well, let's pile on some more sanctions,
and let's squeeze them a little bit more,

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:41.549
and any deal that you're going to strike,
theyâ€™re gonna cheat, and we canâ€™t trust

00:35:41.549 --> 00:35:43.730
them, and itâ€™s gonna be a bad deal, and
I get all that.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:54.390
But my message is that we have to test the
proposition, and if in fact, a deal is struck,

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:58.109
then it's going to be a deal that everyone
around the world is going to be able to look

00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:59.109
at.

00:35:59.109 --> 00:36:03.289
And everybody's going to be able to determine,
does this in fact prevent Iran from getting

00:36:03.289 --> 00:36:05.329
a nuclear weapon?

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:11.460
And if the answer is yes, then it's a good
deal.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:16.210
If the answer is no, then it's not a deal
that I'm interested in striking.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:23.910
There may be some technical arguments, in
part because, there are some who will only

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:29.109
be satisfied with the Iranian regime being
replaced.

00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:34.880
They don't even like the idea of Iran having
any nuclear technology or nuclear know-how.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.140
Matt: In your first campaign, there was talk
of the idea that you might hold direct negotiations

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.130
with countries like that.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.750
Obama: Well, we have had direct negotiations.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.779
That's exactly what we're doing.

00:36:47.779 --> 00:36:54.279
We're now testing the proposition and the
question then is, Matt, is whether or not

00:36:54.279 --> 00:37:01.630
Iran can say yes to the world community that
has determined this is a fair approach that

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:05.819
gives Iran the ability to reenter the international
community and verify that it's not pursuing

00:37:05.819 --> 00:37:06.910
a nuclear weapon.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:14.200
But this is another example of the overall
point that I was making at the start.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:23.839
So it's a good way to summarize: We can't
guarantee that the forces inside of Iran take

00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:29.890
what should be seen as a good deal for Iran.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:34.739
We can't guarantee that they make a rational
decision anymore than we can guarantee Russia

00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:39.880
and Mr. Putin make rational decisions about
like something like Ukraine.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:45.359
We've got to guard against their efforts militarily.

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:52.890
Any aggression they may show we've got to
meet firmly and forcefully.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:38:03.309
But we've also got to see whether things like
diplomacy, things like economic sanctions,

00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:10.210
things like international pressure and international
norms, will in fact make a difference.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.499
Our successes will happen in fits and starts
and sometimes thereâ€™s gonna be a breakthrough

00:38:14.499 --> 00:38:19.210
and sometimes you'll just modestly make things
a little better.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:23.739
And sometimes the play you run doesn't work
and you've got to have a plan B and a plan

00:38:23.739 --> 00:38:30.910
C. But the overall trajectory, the overall
goal is a world in which America continues

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:40.710
to lead, that we're pushing in the direction
of more security, more international norms

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:50.480
and rules, more human rights, more free speech,
less religious intolerance.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:39:01.700
And those efforts over time add up and I'm
confident that there's a way for us to maintain

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:07.989
our idealism, be hardheaded, in assessing
whatâ€™s out there, confronting the dangers

00:39:07.989 --> 00:39:13.240
that we face without exaggerating them.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:20.990
America, I'm pretty certain, is going to be
the indispensable nation for the remainder

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.780
of this century just like it was the last
one.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.780
Alright.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.780
Thanks so much.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.780
Matt: Thank you.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.780
Obama: Appreciate it.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:28.780
Matt just kept on going man.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.780
I had to like.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.780
I gave him like three cues and he just blew
by them.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.780
Did that go over like a half hour longer than
it was supposed to?

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.780
Ezra was definitely better behaved.

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.780
It was a good conversation.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.780
I hope you guys thought it was usefulâ€¦..

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:34.785
Obama: My butt is sore.
