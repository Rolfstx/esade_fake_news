00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.000
Hi, Ellen.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.320
Thank you for having me.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.240
It's an honor to be here.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.640
I watch your show all the time.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
I got a bag of Alabama
peanuts backstage for you--

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.930
Well, thanks.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.210
--and my homeboy
tWitch over here.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.683
Yep, that's right.

00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.138
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.770
He has never been prouder to be
from Alabama as the other day.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.210
Let's first start where
you decided to protest.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.560
When did you make that decision?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.000
And why did you
decide to do that?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.620
Well, I protested in honor of
my daughter, Patti Sue Mathis,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.450
who was gay.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.920
She committed suicide.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.220
And I just said, I wonder
how Patti'd feel today.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.120
Here's a man running for
United States Senate who said

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.850
that gay people are perverts.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.510
Gay people committing a
crime because they're gay.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.090
That's why I did what I did.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.220
I wanted people to
realize it's serious.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.400
A United States senator that
feels that way about people.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.409
He's going to hold
his hand up and say,

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.120
I uphold the Constitution.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.900
The Constitution said,
all men are created equal.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.650
And that's the way
they should be treated.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.137
Gay people have rights, just
like people who are not gay.

00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:16.572
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.210
Well, Patti Sue
would be very, very--

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.530
and is very proud of you.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.300
I can tell you that.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.970
And I know that you had a
hard time, at first, when

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.860
she told you that she was gay.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.630
That was not an easy
thing for you to accept.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.080
And that, to me, makes
it even more beautiful

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.590
that you've turned
around your opinion.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.200
Well, due to teachings
I had as I grew up--

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.675
when I found out Patti
was gay was the end

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:52.160
of her senior year in school--

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.810
and I showed my ass.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.100
I really did.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.320
And I regret it very much.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.712
About three months later,
Patti came to me and said,

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:02.670
I don't want to be gay.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.090
Will you help me get some help?

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.750
And so I said, sure.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.150
That shows you how naive I was.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.180
I made an appointment at
UAB Hospital in Birmingham.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.340
I took Patti up to the hospital.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.070
They did all kinds of
blood work on her that day.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.684
The doctor called
us in about 3:30.

00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:21.350
He said, young lady, there's not
a thing we can do about the way

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.400
you are.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.780
There's nothing we can do.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.550
You're just who you are.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.980
And I said, man, this
doctor must be crazy.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.620
We took her to other
doctors, psychiatrists.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.860
Everyone told my
daughter, Patti,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.640
you can't help the way you are.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.560
That's what made me change.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.970
Yeah, it's amazing that people
think that we're not supposed

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.680
to be who we're born to be.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.370
And that we're supposed to
change to please other people.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.900
And I'm sorry that
your daughter--

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.358
I'm sorry I didn't
get to meet her.

00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:52.950
I'm sorry that she didn't get
to see the world that we're

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.710
living in now that gets better
and better because of people

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.560
like you who are
opening up their minds.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.900
And you must be very
excited that this election

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.130
went the way it did.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.350
I'm very excited it
went the way it did.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.970
The last thing we needed
was Roy Moore in Washington.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.630
Roy Moore needs to be somewhere
getting psychiatric help.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.830
That's where he needs to be.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.330
Yep.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.830
Yep.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.710
He does.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.210
Yep.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.020
Well, I know that this
was a big victory.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.190
There's a lot more to do.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.470
I think there's a lot of
stuff going on that I know--

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.850
will you use your voice?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.870
Will you do this more?

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.240
Because, I mean, look at
the attention you got.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.890
Well, see, I didn't have any
idea what kind of attention

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.740
I was going to have.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.031
First of all, I didn't know
I would even get down there

00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:45.540
where their event was.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.845
I had my sign in the truck.

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:50.320
And I pulled in where
they were parking people,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.360
and I asked the man--

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.120
I said, look, I realize
this is private property.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.730
But I have a sign I would like
to take down to the event,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.320
if I could.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.120
You had to go about a half
a mile down this dirt road

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.007
to get down to the big barn.

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:02.590
He said, sure.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.340
A lot of people
are taking signs.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.360
Well, he just didn't
look at my sign.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.297
He thought I had a "I
Love Roy Moore" sign.

00:04:13.297 --> 00:04:15.380
Next thing you know, I was
down there amongst them

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.070
with the sign.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.579
So that's what happened.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.298
That's how that came about.

00:04:19.298 --> 00:04:21.589
That's the first time I'd
ever done anything like that,

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.110
but I felt like it
needed to be done.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.570
Your sign said, "Judge Roy
Moore called my daughter

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.360
Patti Sue Mathis a pervert
because she was gay.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.980
A 32-year-old Roy Moore dated
teenage girls ages 14 to 17,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.410
so that makes him a
pervert of the worst kind.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.717
Please don't vote
for Roy Moore."

00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:40.550
And so you were holding
that-- first of all,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.170
you couldn't even get
that sign made, right?

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.753
You were trying to
get that sign made.

00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:48.030
No, I called a local sign maker
as I came through Atlanta.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.780
I asked him to make a sign
for me, and he said he would.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.650
And so I texted him what I
wanted on the sign, which

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.210
is what you just read.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.190
And about an hour
later, when I thought

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.080
I was fixing to
go get the sign, I

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.610
discovered he had
texted me back.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.440
And he said, I can't
make that sign for you.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.100
I have a son who's
in the gay community,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.810
and he's rebelled against God.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.360
And I just can't do
such a thing as that.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.660
Well, I knew a little
bit about this man's life

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.430
and how he's lived it.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.390
So I texted him back and I said,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.190
But God also says
you shouldn't be

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.129
living with another man's wife.

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.544
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:39.245
Oh, man, I like you a lot.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:41.186
Come back again,
any time you want.

00:05:41.186 --> 00:05:42.810
Sit in the audience,
whatever you want.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.997
And you don't have to bring
peanuts, but I do like peanuts.

00:05:45.997 --> 00:05:47.580
Because you're a
peanut farmer, right?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.850
I'm a peanut farmer, and it's
an honor to be here, Ellen.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.920
A lot more people watch
your show than you realize.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.016
A lot of us old
peanut farmers, we

00:05:56.016 --> 00:05:57.390
cut them tractors
off and go home

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.650
and watch our favorite show.

00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:06.060
I love you so much.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.048
Thank you, Ellen.

00:06:07.048 --> 00:06:09.024
All right.

00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:13.090
So I want to tell you
about this organization

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.240
that you're going to love.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.531
It's called the Trevor Project.

00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:19.630
It focuses on preventing
suicide for at-risk LGBTQ youth.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.230
It has resources like
counseling, a 24-hour hotline.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.730
You can text them for help.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.220
Shutterfly loves organizations
like the Trevor Project,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.390
so we're going to donate $25,000
in honor of your daughter

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.489
Patti Sue.

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:34.854
For more information
about the Trevor Project,

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:36.750
go to our website.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.425
Hi, I'm Andy.

00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:40.050
Ellen asked me to remind you to
subscribe to her channel so you

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.660
can see more awesome videos,
like videos of me getting

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.790
scared or saying
embarrassing things,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.640
like "ball-peen hammer," and
also some videos of Ellen

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.640
and other celebrities-- if
you're into that sort of thing.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.740
Aah-[BLEEP]!

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.890
God-[BLEEP]!
