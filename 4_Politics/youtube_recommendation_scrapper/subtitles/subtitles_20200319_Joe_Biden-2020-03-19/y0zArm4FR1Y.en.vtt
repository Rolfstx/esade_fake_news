on the Gulf of Mexico a demo team chases

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.860
a new world record we can not take any

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.620
chances with stop a hurricane proof

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.080
tower stands in their way

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
we don't have a handle on the structure

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.600
we have no way to get the explosives in

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.380
no place to put the building it's gonna

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:30.210
be a problem

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.820
three invincible corpse multi-million

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.250
dollar neighbors we're going way off the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:44.090
book with us it could be a record

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.090
shattering drop a world-class disaster

South Padre Island Texas nearly a

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.540
million people hit these beaches every

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.330
year more and more want to stay it may

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.869
be a developer's dream but the race to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.409
build comes at a price

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.609
in this construction frenzy one site

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:36.319
sits abandoned this is ocean tower

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.319
condemned before it was even completed

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.340
it was built on a defective foundation

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.600
and is sinking into the sand it's a 77

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.600
million dollar mistake

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.470
hundreds of metal Shores hold the

building up columns crack under the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:09.149
weight as the tower sinks into the sand

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.069
he tilts to the north threatening homes

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.069
just 46 meters away

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.110
Ocean Tower must be demolished

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.730
controlled demolition Incorporated has

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.530
accepted this challenge

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.480
and all the years I've been working with

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.370
CDI all over the world I've never seen a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.069
structure this well reinforced this well

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.569
built it could be record-breaking a

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.280
reinforced concrete structure this high

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.280
has never been imploded

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.560
we've got a 33 story traditionally

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.720
reinforced tower that rises above a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.849
parking garage the tower itself has got

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.069
one massively reinforced elevator core

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.220
and it's got two stairwells that are

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.870
separately reinforced the towers height

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.870
is a demolition nightmare

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.110
there are mansions to the north a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.590
highway to the west and park facilities

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.590
to the south

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.280
mark Louisa CGI's demolition designer

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:24.849
must drop this 116 meter tower to the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.910
east but he faces a major problem even

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:32.380
here the tower is 30 meters too long to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.810
land without causing damage if it comes

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.280
down at its full height it will crush

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:45.880
these federally protected dunes or the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.430
expensive homes right next to them to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.739
stay in the drop zone mark needs to

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.709
shorten the tower by breaking its spine

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:59.190
as it falls powerful weather systems are

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.580
a fact of life here

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:08.310
the structure was engineered to survive

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:10.290
hurricane-force winds its cores are

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.920
nearly seven times thicker than an

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.110
average residential buildings if we

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.640
can't control the elevator shaft we

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.680
can't control the building and we don't

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.959
have that much room to work with the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.020
property line to the north lies just

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.220
three and a half meters away losing

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.900
control is not an option

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.170
normally this family business from

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.370
Phoenix Maryland implodes structures

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.370
because they've passed their product

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:06.240
Oshin tower is the newest high-rise CDI

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:08.940
has ever dealt with this time mark has

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.460
to push demolition engineering to its

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.990
limits first we're going to straighten

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.699
the tower because there's a bit of a

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.710
tilt about four and a half inches to the

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.970
north side so shortening we're going to

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.740
straighten the tower up in the delay

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.530
sequence then we're going to tilt the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.720
tower to the east and as the tower tilts

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.449
we're going to cut it at different level

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.650
so as it comes over and collapses the

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.259
debris pretty much stays within the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.050
original footprint of the garage the

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:38.690
first step mark needs to figure out how

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:41.699
much rebar reinforces the tower spine

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.440
these core walls are up to nine and a

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.090
half meters long and more than

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.090
three-quarters of a metre theft

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.470
a skid steer arrives to open the month

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:20.530
but the skid-steer can't even penetrate

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.720
the concrete look at it don't look good

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:30.460
tom and you're not even to the rebar yet

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:34.240
not yet look how hard that is Plan B

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:37.389
Plan P load and shoot the question is

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.110
congratula hole in it we would have to

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:45.310
find out the rebar configuration remains

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:49.900
a mystery higher up a salvage crew

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:53.250
strips ocean towers riches these sweets

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.080
are almost complete plumbing installed

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.290
bathrooms tiled and walls ready for

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.290
paint

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:06.780
brand new materials built to last for

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.780
decades ripped out before their top

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.590
metal Shores installed to take stress

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.320
off the failing columns are

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.180
exceptionally valuable these are

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.040
salvageable you know there's a market

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.000
for these we can probably sell them for

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.000
three to four hundred dollars apiece

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:43.759
he'll recycle more than 66-thousand tons

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:45.939
of material 85% of what went into the

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.939
building

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.400
on the east side of the tower the

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.990
parking garage deals mark another big

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.980
challenge most of it sits right where he

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.940
needs to land the tower

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:09.480
but he's not sure if he should remove it

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:12.050
it's a post tension structure something

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.560
the crew doesn't usually come up against

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:18.270
post tension beams are made of concrete

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:23.190
but they're also filled with dozens of

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:26.030
cables these are pulled tight and then

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:31.830
secured with metal anchors at both ends

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:34.620
this makes the beam stronger perfect for

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:38.610
a car garage but potentially disastrous

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:41.520
for CDI you've got beams here that have

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:44.160
almost 2,000 Kip's that's 2,000 times a

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.470
thousand pounds tensile strength if we

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.150
drop the structure on that rubber band

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.740
that has stretched that tight and it

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.680
snaps

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.960
where does it go thousands of one and a

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.990
half kilo anchors could terrorize the

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.990
neighborhood

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:10.770
some of these post-tension beams also

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:13.290
run under the faulty tower demolishing

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:16.290
the garage before shott day could send

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.940
the building into a freefall at that

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.460
point the tower would just inexorably

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:24.090
move there's no stopping it mark faces a

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:27.900
difficult choice leave the garage intact

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:29.640
and risk anchors flying or demolish it

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.700
and hope the tower doesn't come down

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:38.220
early he needs to learn more about the

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:41.220
garage before he makes the call back in

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:44.550
the tower Kraig keys and Tom doubt try

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:48.030
to penetrate the course they need to

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:50.490
drill past the concrete to the rebar

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.120
but like the skid-steer they can't seem

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:56.279
to find a way through

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.279
[Applause]

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:04.320
this is where we try to get either five

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:06.810
holes inside the box you see how much we

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:11.100
have to move the holes that's you know

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:12.390
for the burn that's alright but I'd

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:18.990
really like to see this all the way

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:21.350
through Tom's disappointed so we'd be

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.550
lucky to get one all the way through yep

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.700
even inch and a half and that two inch

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.700
hole

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.160
this is bad news

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:41.640
does it get better as we go up the Coors

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:41.640
seem impenetrable

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:48.490
but they must be broken or the tower

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:52.149
will overshoot the drop zone it's an

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:54.339
expensive mistake I have a federal park

00:10:52.149 --> 00:10:55.870
I've got protected dunes with all that

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:58.060
planning out there that cost hundreds of

00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:00.160
thousand dollars to replace mark must

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.160
figure out a way to avoid this eco

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.520
disaster or the aftermath will cost him

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:10.449
big time

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:13.339
[Music]

00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:16.999
Marc needs to find a way through Ocean

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:18.459
Towers cause where this demolition is

00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:20.539
destined to fail

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:22.489
the only time we've run up against

00:11:20.539 --> 00:11:23.959
concrete this hard and reinforcing that

00:11:22.489 --> 00:11:25.759
as this massive in a structure is a

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:27.259
nuclear construction where we're dealing

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:28.639
with structures that are no more than

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:30.109
three or four storeys tall

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:34.819
here we're dealing with a structure

00:11:30.109 --> 00:11:39.189
that's 33 stories tall the reason this

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:39.189
monster tower sits in a hurricane zone

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:47.149
winds here can reach more than 218

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:51.039
kilometers an hour so the high-rise is

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:51.039
designed to resist annihilation

00:11:53.720 --> 00:12:00.540
now machines are failing to penetrate

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:05.610
its hurricane-proof cores Marx never had

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:08.519
this problem before he calls in his

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:11.069
brother Doug I really needed his

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:12.509
experience in his expertise he has far

00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:15.420
more experience blasting heavily

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:20.100
reinforced concrete than I they consider

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:23.720
an unprecedented plan attack the towers

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:26.790
cores with explosives before shot day

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.410
normally they use test blasts to see how

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:36.689
a structure will react to this type of

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:38.430
demolition but they've never tried to

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:42.509
reduce the strength of a building with

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:45.480
explosives before the implosion until

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:48.360
now we determined that it would be best

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:54.209
to modify the cores themselves by pre

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:56.850
blasting holes so essentially leaving

00:12:54.209 --> 00:12:58.110
the cores standing up on legs much more

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.740
efficient to deal with that with

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.740
explosives

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:10.690
for the first time ever CD I will use

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:13.440
explosives to attack a structure before

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.560
that post-tension beams at the east end

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.090
of the parking garage

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.420
do not run underneath the tower

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:44.550
[Music]

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.810
this means it should be safe to demolish

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.990
the part that sits in the drop zone

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:53.280

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.280
mark assigns Raisa kasi

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.190
post-tensioning is about the hardest

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.630
thing erect convention that tension is

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.769
about two million pounds on every one of

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.920
those little cables

00:14:04.769 --> 00:14:11.560
we go in the multiprocessor cracks the

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.660
concrete and loosens the concrete

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.310
once it goes slack its lost tension and

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.490
then we can chew in it and it may come

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.490
down

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.649
[Music]

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:32.930
the excavator has to avoid the protected

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.110
dunes to the east so the operator works

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:38.480
from the south side

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:41.500
he must pulverize almost 2,000 square

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.500

damaged columns and the tower

[Music]

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:20.530
Doug and Tom get ready to pre blast the

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:23.530
course they've never done this before so

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:25.060
they worry about flying debris you just

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:29.650
wondering for the first shot as this

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:31.960
could of with neighbors you think we'd

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:35.590
be better off to stand downstairs that's

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:38.560
why they load two walls with different

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:41.380
amounts of dynamite we're just kind of

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.770
playing blind right now until we see the

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.000
results of this usually you can bless

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:49.120
country with a half a pound per cubic

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.490
yard some of these we probably have 10

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.740
pounds to the cubic yard you can't use

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:56.340
the rule of thumb loading densities

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.090
we're going way off the book with us

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.940
here's the plan

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:05.010
they've loaded dynamite in a series of

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:07.570
circles each larger than the last

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:11.260
explosives closest to the center will go

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:14.770
off first then the explosions will

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:19.360
radiate out this should shatter the

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:20.620
concrete and leave two legs dug them in

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:27.210
a red

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:27.210
[Music]

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:59.100
can you say anything oh we're through oh

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:17.290
yeah you're clear Victor come one up see

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.020
that's beautiful it is we're gonna need

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:36.810
a couple of brooms and a couple of

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:36.810
shovels to clean up this stairwell good

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:47.420
here's your burn both shots blasted

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.870
through the concrete there's fine here

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.100
done

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:56.330
there are yep one two three four and

00:17:52.100 --> 00:18:00.800
five but smaller quantities of dynamite

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:03.440
loaded into more holes works best you

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.960
don't need to muscle concrete out what

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.160
we need to do is rely on our sequential

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:12.800
pattern on how we initiate the delays

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.470
good news for the loaders bad news for

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.370
the struggling drillers they'll have to

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:21.080
muscle even more holes into the cores if

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.990
you look straight in there I don't know

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.170
how they got a hole at all and there's

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:29.650
another serious concern we took their

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.650
cover down

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:36.230
debris rip through the protective

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:40.309
covering and shattered ocean towers

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:42.799
triple pane windows we've blasted the

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:46.489
whole I mean that's great it did a fine

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:50.299
job but the byproduct wasn't acceptable

00:18:46.489 --> 00:18:54.769
that was too much fun the neighbors are

00:18:50.299 --> 00:18:58.570
a stone's throw away Doug will have to

00:18:54.769 --> 00:18:58.570
fine-tune the pre blasting plan

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:06.210
things are getting ugly in the parking

00:19:04.179 --> 00:19:06.210
garage

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.080
I got called with one of my employees so

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.510
I'm here to the parking garage saying

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:19.050
that concrete falling off of the floor

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:20.760
slab this is actually one of the pieces

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.120
of concrete that are popping out of the

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:28.050
slab you can see where the rebar the

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:31.170
cable are running through the slab this

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:34.410
would probably be very bad if you get

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:38.180
hit on the head with it post tension

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.180
cables in the beams are snapping

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.410
shattering the concrete

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:53.260
the crew could get their skulls cracked

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.260
everyone has to evacuate

00:19:55.399 --> 00:20:00.529
and there's another challenge as we

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:02.149
pulverized the building there's still

00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:03.469
these chunks left hanging on these

00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:06.080
tendons which we call Widow makers

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:10.429
because they could fall down and whack

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:13.789
you in the head and take you up like

00:20:10.429 --> 00:20:16.969
Victor's crew raise team can't work in

00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:18.999
this dangerous environment if he doesn't

00:20:16.969 --> 00:20:22.789
find a way to rip out the widow-makers

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:25.910
you'll have to pull the excavators bring

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:28.640
the project to a halt

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:31.280
we need to separate this from that

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:34.250
before we go that way as as we go this

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.840
way it gets really funky I mean one BAE

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.520
over from where we're stopping us all

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.410
that shoring all those damaged columns

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.240
we need to clean this off

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.670
it screw it straight through it and

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.880
release any pull that this thing has on

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.880
that

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.700
my first choice would be to let's go

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:55.080
cross the street in that job Lane

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:57.440
I can see if I can cheer mom yeah

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.390
next baby

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.710
we had that spaghetti mess there without

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:05.270
fucking three men

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:08.840
how long did it take you to swap out hey

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:14.270
totally all right I mean only one way to

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:16.100
find out no I

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:19.010
you know I'd have to get to do with the

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:23.330
man lift and get it but here it's not

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:27.400
fun the operator will try to cut the

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:27.400
widow-makers down with a job link

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:33.430
[Music]

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:36.910
in the tower the crew hammers out a plan

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:40.450
for the course they face a difficult

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:45.280
trade-off smaller quantities of dynamite

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:47.560
spread over a larger area works best but

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:52.270
a larger pre blast area means more

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.790
loading holes and usable drill holes are

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:56.530
hard to come by

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.720
here's the problem the cores are

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.860
reinforced with up to six vertical

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.830
layers of rebar

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:05.530
three times the normal amount and the

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.360
layers are staggered it's almost

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.180
impossible for a driller to get a

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.820
straight hole through the rebar is

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.860
really beyond anyone's expectations when

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.590
you look at the plans initially say why

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:21.150
would anyone put this much rebar in this

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:23.670
structure but there's home

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.940
the team clears out some pre blasted

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.940
sites

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:33.610
now they can finally see the rebar

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:35.440
pattern ultimately I'm gonna want the

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:39.730
drillers to try to get in here and drill

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:49.120
this way Craig will try and drill holes

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:50.830
between the rebar layers by me drilling

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.710
longitudinally through the wall I can

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.160
drill three holes and blast just three

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.710
holes

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.700
compared to blasting 40 holes on the

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:02.620
outside edge there are seven shot floors

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:06.040
this longitudinal drilling could save

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:09.460
the team thousands of holes it's a demo

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:12.640
marathon he must push through almost two

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:15.600
meters of concrete four times the length

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.600
of a regular hole

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:32.640
today he's rewarded and went now

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.130
surprisingly well

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.360
the rebar is spaced far enough apart to

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:40.250
where I could get the longitude holes

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.250
into it at least in this wall

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:53.490
the drilling is under control but the

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:53.490
weather is not a violent storm rolls in

00:23:54.380 --> 00:24:05.660
Victor before you on it catches the crew

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.700
off-guard

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.310
yeah that doesn't that look good does

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.740
that

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:23.800
Victor can't reach workers exposed to

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:26.680
the elements on an upper floor jesse

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:30.130
mclees rushes up to warn them before the

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.570
storms fury really hits Victor we have

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:38.200
stuff coming off the roof of the

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:40.450
building - there's insulation plastic

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.630
there's a lot of debris coming off the

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.630
roof

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:50.710
[Music]

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:53.619
everyone is evacuated and the day is

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.360
lost with more than 2,000 holes still

00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:57.540
left to drill

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.540
[Music]

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:07.670
more than three weeks pass the crew

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:13.470
finally gets a break in the weather

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:15.750
clear sunny skies it won't last so they

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:19.080
move quickly to drill the upper floors

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:21.510
before the storms return if you just

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.610
walk away slowly they'll release and let

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:25.260
you walk let me go real quick when you

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:30.840
go over the edge it stops you from going

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:36.060
over the edge gym master pole works a

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:38.310
half step away from a 60 meter draw he

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:47.070
preps outer columns so the team can load

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:48.930
dynamite his drill weighs 45 kilos 60

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:51.620
miles an hour up here you can't stand on

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:55.610
the edge it'll just take you right off

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.610
it's crazy up here

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.039
[Applause]

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.760
and I've been doing this 10 years and

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.900
still a little bit of pee comes out

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:23.010
whenever have to get on the edge like

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:26.990
this the pre blasting and drilling show

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.990
mark how strong Ocean Tower is

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:33.090
he worries the three cores won't come

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.359
down on shot day

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:37.309
[Music]

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:39.489
the building could shear away from the

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:43.599
hurricane fruit spine

00:26:39.489 --> 00:26:43.599
mark has to off his game

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:51.520
for this demolition could turn into a

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.520
record-breaking disaster

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:05.960
Doug and Tom are ready to pre blast more

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:07.790
core walls this demo project marks the

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.280
first time they've ever used explosives

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:14.120
to reduce a building strength before

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:16.700
shot day so they're still trying to get

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:20.600
the formula down what we're going to do

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.950
is adjust the loading density cut the

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.429
amount of explosives we're putting down

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:27.080
per hole so we can try to keep the

00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:29.330
concrete from flying where it could

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.250
impact the adjacent properties they're

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.940
loading smaller quantities of dynamite

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:37.880
into more holes so they must also

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:47.179
fine-tune the initiation system for the

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:49.429
475 here you starting at 300 upstairs no

00:27:47.179 --> 00:27:54.340
the 475 is going to initiate the cord

00:27:49.429 --> 00:27:59.390
we're gonna go electric to 475 to cord

00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:04.110
upstairs just electric they work out a

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:06.000
plan Victor are you clear

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:12.570
all right we're good Tom warm up the

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:17.480
machine tell me when you're warmed up 5

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.480
4 3 2 1 fire

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:46.410
yes explosives more holes better results

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:51.120
talk about that's the ticket

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.120
success the system works

00:28:51.250 --> 00:29:04.260
they've mastered the pre blasting but

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.260
elsewhere a huge setback

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:10.330
Craig thought he could drill Ocean

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:12.910
Towers Coors longitudinal but after

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:17.620
weeks of work he fails to sink the

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:21.610
required holes this is a lot of rebar

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:23.380
this wall was not supposed to be it's so

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.720
bad that he can't get a single

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:31.960
longitudinal hole into the elevator

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:35.920
shaft the cores defy one of Sidi eyes

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:38.290
best I'm afraid we're resigned to spot

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.300
drilling the elevator shaft just because

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:42.580
it's steel is too tight he's not gonna

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:45.840
be able to get a hole in their CD eyes

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:48.850
demolition designer must up his strategy

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.780
mark also worries that the rebar dent

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:55.210
scores will defy him on shot day he

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.760
decides that a complex network of high

00:29:55.210 --> 00:30:00.160
tensile steel may do the trick

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.110
mark came up with the cabling plan gave

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.080
us the drawings emailed him last night

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:08.800
so now I have to go you know discuss it

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:13.090
in principle in the building grab

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:17.410
they're down we're gonna grab here down

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:21.120
and we're gonna grab there down but the

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:24.970
crew have never seen anything like this

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:28.030
852 meters of cable connecting cores and

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:31.870
columns to one another on five of the

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:34.530
towers floors the cable is three times

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:37.690
stronger than the kind they normally use

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:39.910
because it's never had to work this hard

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.710
the cables connect the elevator cord

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.890
into stair cores and then into the

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:46.060
columns out in the direction of fall as

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.690
we move through the building those

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.909
cables will sequentially go into tension

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:53.690
although many that will pull the power

00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:57.470
over toward the Gulf of Mexico

00:30:53.690 --> 00:31:01.710
Craig hustles to finish the extra work

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:03.210
it's from ceiling to floor we just try

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.340
to grab the top of the column and the

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:07.229
bottom of the column through the floor

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.849
slabs so the floor slabs helps and

00:31:07.229 --> 00:31:12.210
nothing slides up and down the columns

00:31:08.849 --> 00:31:14.549
as the building's moving what we have

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:23.429
for tools is just a chain come along and

00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:30.599
a sledgehammer the Funday the cable

00:31:23.429 --> 00:31:33.080
right there the cabling is done Tom

00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:35.669
starts to load dynamite into the cores

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:40.919
he doesn't usually work with a tape

00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:43.470
measure on most demo sites CDI uses bags

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:46.259
filled with sand to space out dynamite

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:50.249
it's called deck loading and it makes

00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:54.149
explosives more efficient but that won't

00:31:50.249 --> 00:31:56.279
work in these rebar infested walls if

00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:59.070
you're trying to push a bag in and you

00:31:56.279 --> 00:32:01.979
catch a piece of that rebar and that bag

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:04.080
bridges you've now lost that hole and

00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:06.700
with a structure of this size we don't

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:11.889
want to lose a single hole

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:13.899
the solution air deck loading Tom

00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:16.960
calculates the optimal distance between

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:20.080
sticks of dynamite and uses a tape

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.330
measure to position the explosives this

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.470
way he gets the benefit of deck loading

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.470
without the risk

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:39.710
at the base of the tower Doug calculates

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.509
another crucial load the column when

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.429
welding now is a big controlling column

00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:45.320
there are four columns that are probably

00:32:43.429 --> 00:32:47.750
the most important in the building that

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:50.480
we have to crack to allow it to bend and

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.820
then eliminate completely for each hole

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.500
I'll calculate how many cubic yards or

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.740
percentage of a cubic yard each hole

00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:00.049
takes care of and from what 35 years of

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.419
experience I know how much explosive it

00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:06.139
takes per cubic yard of this real

00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:08.620
brittle high-density concrete bad

00:33:06.139 --> 00:33:11.389
weather continues to plague the crew

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:14.629
dangerous winds often confine them to

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:16.090
the lower floors but they can't delay

00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:19.340
any more

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:20.830
someone has to load columns on four of

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:26.149
the upper floors

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:28.610
once again it's Jim's lucky day the

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:31.130
height still gut-wrenching

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:34.820
but this time there's no sunshine to

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:37.700
comfort him the change in weather pushes

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.320
him to the edge he's got a long way to

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:43.690
go

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.690
39 exposed columns still too low

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:57.489
seedy eyes wiring guru arrives on site

00:33:53.840 --> 00:34:00.470
and she doesn't catch a break either

00:33:57.489 --> 00:34:02.799
every column encored the team is loaded

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:06.289
needs to be wired

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:10.359
Stacy Louisa and her sister Devon are

00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:10.359
forced to brave the windy upper floors

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:18.109
I'll lean into it here I'd love to wait

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.520
for this storm to pass and be able to do

00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:21.560
this tomorrow but unfortunately the

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.849
clocks tickin we need to get this done

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.849
to that we'll top it out

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:32.950
and the wiring has never been this

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:34.720
complicated the problem is is the

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:36.760
stairwells are sort of a mix and match

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.889
between longitudinal drilling and spot

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.960
drilling and when wiring them we have to

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:44.500
treat them very differently her crew

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.540
must run to initiation lines one for the

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.879
regular holes and one for the

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.560
longitudinal holes we can't let these

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:52.870
two lines touch they're on two totally

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.190
different times if these two lines were

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:55.720
actually to come into contact with each

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.550
other basically you could have an entire

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.960
core going off either five seconds too

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:02.380
early or five seconds too late which

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:05.980
would be unbelievably bad the towel

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:08.850
would fall uncontrollably putting the

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.850
neighbors at risk

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.280
so it's a constant challenge to check

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:25.560
double check recheck that these cannot

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:31.640
possibly touch each other what if we put

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:31.640
a big piece on it why take the chance

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:39.420
piece of fabric and just laid it that's

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.790
a good we've got to get all these lines

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.140
weighted down to my satisfaction really

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.480
which is basically weighting it down

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.720
every three or four feet it's very

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.720
time-consuming

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.970
they don't call me the Martha Stewart of

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.970
demolition for nothing

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.440
crews have finished demolishing the east

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:02.430
side of the parking garage what's left

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.320
of the structure is now safe for workers

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:07.530
Victor's crew hustles to make up lost

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.530
time

00:36:09.029 --> 00:36:12.140
now it's when you need to run

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.360
[Music]

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:32.700
upstairs ray checks the team's cabling

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:34.800
job 35,000 pounds is breaking strength

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.839
it'll do much more than that

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.780
you could pick up a tank with this stuff

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:42.030
well any difficulty at all but will

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:47.900
these cables be enough to pull the

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:50.880
towers course we'll find out firsthand

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:54.020
the mission is to get unprecedented

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.609
shots of the implosion of this tower

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:59.460
so what gone ahead and done is planted

00:36:56.609 --> 00:37:01.170
12 cameras strategically placed

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:10.589
throughout the tower between the 24th

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:15.500
and the roof all this stuff is going to

00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:23.369
two different boxes we got custom-made

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:25.940
iron cages to protect the footage for

00:37:23.369 --> 00:37:25.940
the trip down

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.260
[Music]

00:37:34.319 --> 00:37:42.209
it's shot did Stacy and her crew

00:37:38.459 --> 00:37:44.369
finished wiring the tower they've laid

00:37:42.209 --> 00:37:48.239
more than four kilometers of detonation

00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:49.380
cord sir I need you got the weight of

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:53.549
this no it's not heavy you don't know

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:57.179
but you just I just need well I mean I

00:37:53.549 --> 00:37:59.429
need someone to hold it now we need to

00:37:57.179 --> 00:38:02.519
get the weight off underneath this they

00:37:59.429 --> 00:38:03.739
can hold it for a minute or two really

00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:06.329
yes

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:11.849
if we can not take any chances let's not

00:38:06.329 --> 00:38:15.529
no CDI walks the building to

00:38:11.849 --> 00:38:15.529
triple-check thousands of connections

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:27.019
hey brain Devin also keep an eye out on

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:30.220
your deck loaded columns be sure the

00:38:27.019 --> 00:38:30.220
greenhorn is tucked in

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:38.500
[Music]

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:46.720
when we blast we're gonna find out real

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:52.960
fast if we're right or wrong you know

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:56.940
will either be heroes or bones police

I'm starting to work my way in now from

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:57.240
a distance the high-rise appears to have

00:41:53.430 --> 00:42:04.080

the outer part of the structure begins

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.910
to form

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:29.910
the high-rise doesn't tilt as much as

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:21.610
but Stacy's wiring system comes through

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.610
the spines fail and breakup

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:32.850
to the east the tower lands in the drop

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:44.340
in this unprecedented footage we get a

00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:47.240
chance to ride this monster tower as it

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.240

the top five floors of a stairwell core

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:18.380
rolls off the debris pile

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:30.630
and comes to rest outside the northern

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:33.120
perimeter they explore the site relief

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.890
something here the debris sits nearly

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.560
one and a half meters beyond the

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:39.330
perimeter we are all clear

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.910
when the houses to the north mark

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:44.250
philosophy copy that none of the

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:47.160
million-dollar homes are damaged but a

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:50.010
section of fence is crushed those shafts

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:52.050
are just so rigid so tough it just road

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:54.750
road road road road over and then it

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:58.560
rolled off to the side crews quickly

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.670
mobilized to clean up everything else

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.430
went as planned

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:05.160
I wish I could have have gotten it to

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:06.630
move maybe another 10 15 feet initially

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.010
then then we got it and maybe we

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:10.920
wouldn't have this little problem on the

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:12.510
north side but the plan is good to be

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.270
able to have that energy at your

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:16.980
disposal and use it effectively it has

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.860
to make you smile it has to make your

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:23.280
day the mission to drop the highest

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:25.430
reinforced concrete structure ever is a

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.310
success

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:32.240
seedy I will submit this project to the

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:35.990

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:42.080
rather forget but in the wake of its

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:45.760
destruction the mission to build on this

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.760
