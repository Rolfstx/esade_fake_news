President Obama:
Hello. Hello. How are you? Good to see you.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.967
(applause)

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:16.367
Thank you so much, everybody. Please have
a seat. Welcome to the White House. And congratulations,

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:24.900
a little belatedly, to the Los Angeles Lakers
for winning your 15th -- 15th -- NBA title,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.000
and fourth in the past 10 years. Before I
say a few things about the Lakers, I just

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
want to acknowledge some wonderful members
of Congress and big Lakers fans who are here:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.767
Congresswoman Jane Harman, Congresswoman Laura
Richardson, Congressman Adam Schiff, Congressman

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:48.700
Brad Sherman, and Lucille Roybal-Allard. Please,
everybody, give them a big round of applause.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.367
(applause)

00:00:52.367 --> 00:01:00.900
Now, as folks here will tell you, the only
thing that is better than playing basketball

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.667
-- the only thing that's better than watching
basketball is playing basketball -- but I'm

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:15.033
48, and soon to be 49, and it's a little harder
these days to move around on the court, especially

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:23.900
when you're playing against kids who are half
your age. But I still get enormous, enormous

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.567
pleasure from watching great athletes on the
court. And nobody exemplifies excellence in

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:35.100
basketball better than the
Los Angeles Lakers last year.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.800
(applause)

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.867
I want to congratulate everybody who helped
make this team what it is -- from the assistants

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:51.834
to the front office staff, to the trainers
and the ticket-takers, all the fans back in

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:57.734
L.A. who bleed purple and gold. You all should
be very proud. That's you.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.734
(laughter)

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:07.066
I want to congratulate Jeanie Buss and the
rest of the Buss family for guiding this team

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.800
so well for the last 30 years.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.467
(applause)

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:20.700
I'm especially excited to meet
Coach Phil Jackson, the Zen Master.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.467
(laughter)

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:29.266
I've been a fan of Coach Jackson's ever since
his days running the triangle offense in Chicago.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:35.867
I want to congratulate him on his tenth NBA
championship -- the most in history. I do

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:38.400
want to point out that six of them came with
the Bulls.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.667
(laughter)

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:41.834
I just want to point that out.

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:43.800
Speaker:
Not for long. Not for
long. Not for long.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.533
(laughter)

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.133
President Obama:
You remember that, Magic?

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:47.900
Magic Johnson:
Yes, sir.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.500
(laughter)

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.867
President Obama:
-- '90-'91? Remember
when -- Jordan went out --

00:02:51.867 --> 00:03:00.867
(laughter and applause)

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:02.800
You know, they won the first game and they
were feeling cocky.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.567
(laughter)

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:10.166
And Paxson was hitting all those shots. Anyway,
we're not -- that's not why we're here.

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:14.567
(laughter)

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:22.834
I was hoping that, Coach, you were going to
bring some books for Republicans and Democrats

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:26.133
in Congress maybe to get them to start playing like a team together.

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:27.367
(laughter)

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:34.433
Coach is famous for passing out books and
helping people get the job done. We are obviously

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:39.767
honored to have one of the all-time
greats in NBA history, Magic Johnson.

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:50.433
(applause)

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:53.367
Magic did pretty well during his
time with the Lakers. He wasn't bad.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:56.166
(laughter)

00:03:56.166 --> 00:04:01.100
And now a new generation is continuing his
legacy. But obviously part of what makes Magic

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.266
special wasn't just how he played on the
court, but also just the infectious enthusiasm

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:13.734
about life and what he's now doing with businesses
and minority communities. He's just been an

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:18.567
outstanding leader in our country for a long
time. Of course, I've got to recognize Kobe

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:31.867
Bryant -- one of the most competitive players
I've ever seen -- (applause) -- for being

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:39.500
named Finals MVP last year, obviously already
MVPs under his belt, the youngest player ever

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:50.100
to reach 25,000 points in his career. And
he's playing with a broken finger. Now, if

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.367
I was -- if I had a broken finger I would
have trouble getting out of bed.

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:55.834
(laughter)

00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:59.834
And he's still leading the team day in and
day out. This is a team that never lost its

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:05.166
focus last season -- from the first tip-off
to the final buzzer. I know that the Lakers

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:09.967
have a tradition of ending each team gathering
-- whether it's a practice, or a game, or

00:05:09.967 --> 00:05:16.033
a team meeting -- by with the chant, "1, 2,
3, Rings." As Lamar Odom said, "We kind of

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:21.567
always saw that light." Everyone was willing
to do what it took to get a little stronger,

00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:26.567
to play a little harder, and to bring home
that title. But I think it's important to

00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:30.934
note that this team also knows that being
a champ is about more than trophies and rings.

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:34.300
It's about being a winner off the court as
well as on it -- and giving back to those

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.567
who are less fortunate. The Lakers and the
NBA have always been about serving others

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:43.166
-- at home and around the world. And that
tradition continued last week, when the NBA

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:51.033
and the Players Association, led by Derek
Fisher, pledged to donate $1 million to support

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:52.266
relief efforts in Haiti.

00:05:52.266 --> 00:06:03.300
(applause)

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.266
Jordan Farmar and Pau Gasol are also donating
their money to the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund.

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:15.166
Pau pledged $1,000 for every point he scored
against the Knicks -- and I'm glad he dropped

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:21.600
20 -- (laughter) -- helping the Lakers to
beat New York and changing the lives of Haitians

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.033
thousands of miles away. And earlier today,
the team joined with our United We Serve initiative

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:31.266
to hold a fitness clinic for kids from Stanton
Elementary School right here in Washington,

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:37.633
D.C. -- teaching them about a few moves, but
also how to live healthy and active lives.

00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:43.333
So I just want to again thank the entire Lakers
organization for your service, for the great

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:49.633
joy that you have given the city of Los Angeles,
but also the incredible competition youâ¬ "!re

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:57.533
your organization has graced the basketball
court with for decades now. If this season

00:06:57.533 --> 00:07:01.133
is anything like the last one -- I know that
you guys have your sights on the NBA finals

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:06.967
-- so we might see you here before long.
But we are very grateful for your presence

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:08.700
here today. Give them a big round of applause.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:28.300
(applause)

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.867
Now, one last thing. I was also told that
Mr. Brown here intends to win the dunk contest

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:39.100
-- (laughter) -- so we'll see how that goes.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.166
We're going to break down the podium and get a formal picture. Is that right? Okay, let's go.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.433
(cross talk)

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:08.633
President Obama:
Alright. I get my
official Lakers jersey here.

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:16.533
(applause)

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:23.367
I get my ball. It's
official. Everybody get it?

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:27.300
(laughter)

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.333
I know. I know.

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:29.500
(laughter)

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.533
It won't last long.

00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:35.300
(laughter)

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.967
Alright. Well, congratulations again,
guys. Thank you. I'm very proud of you.

00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:40.100
Thank you so much, Kobe.
