00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.590
Tijuana – Mexico.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.900
Just over the US-border.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.750
Every day, thousands of people make their
way over to the other side.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.680
Amongst them: Illegal immigrants, hard-partying
tourists from the US, and traffickers.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.830
This strip of border is under close surveillance.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.970
Weapons go to Mexico, drugs to the US – a
battle that rages on with no end in sight,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.530
regardless of how tall the fence is.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.780
Thousands of people have already paid – with
their lives.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.390
All of these factors make Tijuana one of the
most extreme cities in the world.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.060
Poverty, slums, and drug abuse on one side.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.570
And on the other?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.230
Mexico’s biggest den of prostitution and
excess.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.810
It’s a place where the parties get wilder
and wilder and never seem to stop.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.550
And yet: Anyone who commits a crime in Tijuana
will soon find themselves here.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.080
La Mesa!

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.140
A prison that strikes more than fear into
Mexicans...

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.340
[Voiceover]: Everything is dirty; just sitting
on the toilet is horrendous.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.020
…and one where Americans feel like scum!

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.180
I mean, I am a United States marine.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.959
Over there, I am a hero, over here I am a
villain.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.959
A self-contained empire.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.830
Governed by ONE man.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.670
Who rules with an iron fist.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.590
[Voiceover]: “I am very proud.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.920
This prison used to be notorious.”

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.330
A jail that houses cold-blooded killers.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.280
[Voiceover]: I killed multiple police officers,
including a high-ranking commander.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.560
It was obvious that they would have it in
for me.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.980
Fighting back leads to harsh punishments.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.530
[Voiceover]: They just leave us to rot away
in here and lock the doors.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.230
The inmates?

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.340
Known for having short fuses.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.980
La Mesas’ history is peppered with riots
and rebellions.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.890
And a high death toll.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.310
No narration

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.120
The next rebellion is a constant threat.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.640
Keeping things under control is a potentially
deadly battle.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.230
In one of the toughest prisons in the world.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.550
No narration

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.690
Six thirty in the morning.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.150
A new shift is about to start at one of Mexico’s
most notorious prisons, located in the heart

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.780
of downtown Tijuana.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.410
Commanding officer Mario Antonio Meza Flores
arrives.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.210
He’s responsible for security inside the
jail.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.240
And he’s constantly in danger.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.400
Apart from the Mexican police and justice,
Tijuana is governed by one thing above anything

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.069
else: Drug cartels.

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.950
Attract their attention and you won’t be
around for long.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.310
The morning security routine.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.820
Regardless of whether you’re a guard or
the commander-in-chief, everyone has to undergo

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.979
the checks.

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.300
Metal detector, security scan, and a physical
search.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.400
There’s no getting out of it.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.690
Drugs, weapons, and even cigarettes are all
banned from La Mesa.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.800
At seven, the guards start to get ready for
duty.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800
Their job?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.290
To keep the three thousand or so inmates under
control.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.410
This involves patrolling the prison and raiding
cells.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.980
Block by block, the commander’s troops tear
the cells apart in a never-ending cycle.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.650
[Voiceover]: We’re mainly looking for weapons
and substances like drugs and tobacco.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.930
First things first: The morning briefing.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:12.240
The guards are equipped with handcuffs, batons,
and tear gas.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.070
No narration

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.070
Their destination?

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.599
The cell blocks.

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:28.419
La Mesa separates its prisoners according
to crime, risk profile, age, and gender.

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.569
Building one is home to drug traffickers,
thieves, and those convicted of violent crimes.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.789
In section two, there are kidnappers and murderers
with a low risk potential.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.210
Three and four house small-scale criminals,
prison workers, and the elderly.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.830
Locked away in section five?

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.440
Sex offenders and the sick.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.849
Ranging from diabetes to HIV.

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.439
They all share a central area.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.400
Block number 6 is completely cut off from
the rest of the prison.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.139
This wing is home to the toughest of all the
inmates: Cartel killers and serial murderers.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.319
And then there’s a whole separate block
for women.

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.099
Commander Flores starts his inspection in
block number one.

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.910
Every day, up to 20 new prisoners wind up
here.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.379
Flores’ goal is to determine what the mood
is like here.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.830
Are the inmates acting up at the moment?

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.430
Are there any gangs forming inside the cells?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.849
And: Where should he start the next raid?

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:40.740
No narration

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:50.309
For committing crimes like theft, mugging,
possession of a weapon, and drug trafficking,

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:56.449
each cell in block one at La Mesa holds an
average of eight to ten criminals.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.309
They share an area of just four by four-and-a-half
meters.

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:05.930
Inmates have few belongings: mainly a few
pieces of clothing, towels, and small souvenirs

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.699
from the world outside.

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:13.370
All stripped back to the bare essentials.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:20.699
No narration

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:24.669
One of the inmates: Abraham Chaves Orozco.

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:29.009
At the age of 22, he is one of the youngest
in La Mesa.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.389
Arrested at the airport for drug trafficking,
he was sentenced to five years.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.039
He’s already done three.

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:40.800
That means three years of sleeping, showering,
going to the toilet – without a single ounce

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.330
of privacy.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:56.369
[Voiceover]: Everything is dirty; just sitting
on the toilet is horrendous.

00:07:56.369 --> 00:08:03.360
I’ve had a foot infection in the past...

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.770
The food is bad and unhygienic...

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.900
And it’s freaking hot...

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:17.039
Abraham’s family have long been trying to
get him relocated to another prison.

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:19.240
Though to no avail so far.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.789
But he’s still hopeful.

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:27.469
Many other inmates have lost all sense of
hope.

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:34.550
Particularly the prison’s American residents.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.280
Such as Taylor Elliott Howard.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.410
After all, US citizens have to remember that
getting in trouble with the law in Tijuana

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:47.050
– just a stone’s throw from home – will
land them HERE.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.630
Taylor shares his cell with six other Americans.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.640
They are kept separate from the others.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.360
The risk of altercations with other inmates
is too high.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.090
I have been accused of stealing a car.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.680
Armed robbery of a car.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.300
So, they said I had two guns, an AR-15 and
a 9-millimeter.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.430
So they gave me nine years for that.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:19.580
Nine years in La Mesa – penned up in one
of the toughest prisons in the world.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.694
This is my bed, this is where I sleep right
here.

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:27.830
This is where Shawn sleeps, this is Troy right
here.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.959
Over here on the top we got Brandon, we got
Dakota, we got Ty.

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:35.230
And Mike sleeps right here.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:40.589
This is the bathroom.

00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:44.100
The sink, where we wash our hands, the toilet
over here.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:50.920
Right now, as you can see, the water is off,
and it comes on only for a few hours a day.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.269
The misuse here is terrible.

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:55.710
The living conditions here are terrible.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.540
I am a combat veteran, I am a United States
marine, I served in the Iraqi war.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.060
I am decorated.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.180
Over there I am a hero, over here I am a villain.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.050
I can’t even make a phone call to my family
to let them know where I am.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.519
But the worst thing isn’t the cell itself.

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:13.839
Even worse is the fact that the inmates are
almost never allowed out.

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:17.230
We only get two hours of sun a week.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.620
If that – sometimes they cut it short, or
sometimes somebody will do something stupid

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.410
on the yard and get the yard messed up for
the rest of us.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.470
So we get like half an hour, an hour if somebody
messes up.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.720
Other than that we are stuck in here 24 hours
a day.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.880
6 days a week

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.509
In La Mesa, exercise and fresh air are a luxury.

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:46.050
Regardless of whether you’re a car thief,
drug dealer, child abuser, or cartel killer.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.550
The only glimpse any of them get of the sun
tends to be through bars.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:55.310
They spend almost their entire sentence in
their cells.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.769
This means two square meters for each inmate.

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:00.550
Some for just a few years.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:08.129
Others for the rest of their lives, no doubt
about it.

00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:12.040
Locked away on an almost permanent basis without
any privacy.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.079
In a prison with an iron-clad set of rules.

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.060
Rules laid out by ONE man.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.130
HE has had the first and last word on what
goes on at La Mesa since 2014.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.440
Director Cesar Daniel Ramirez Acevedo.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.920
[Voiceover]:
Mr. Director, sir, I am reporting for duty.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.700
There are just a few small abnormalities,
everything is in order.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.839
[Voiceover]: “OK, that’s good to know.”

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:37.680
Every day, Acevedo checks whether his prison
is still under control.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.940
And tries to isolate problem cases as early
as possible.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:50.170
Before La Mesa, Acevedo had already held the
post of director at five other Mexican prisons.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.820
Now he’s in the heart of Tijuana.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:59.730
A city where drug cartels battle it out for
total domination – and where 85 percent

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.209
of all murders are related to narcotics.

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:09.460
Acevedo rules with the principle of 100% control.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:16.470
No matter what’s going on in his jail, Director
Acevedo knows about it.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.630
The first inmates are allowed outside early
in the morning.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.040
A moment that puts all of the wardens on high
alert.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.690
After all, the chance of an attack on the
guards – perhaps using a homemade weapon

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:35.629
– is never higher than at this moment.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:46.209
No narration

00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:48.579
The routine is always the same.

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:52.660
Between Monday and Thursday, the guards open
up very specific cells.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.139
On a certain floor of a specific building.

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:00.310
The same cells at the same time every week.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.889
And only one at a time.

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:08.019
The next group cannot be released until all
of the inmates are in the stairway.

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:16.490
This is how the guards keep the upper hand.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:23.519
For most inmates, this precise moment offers
them the only two hours of direct sunlight

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:25.190
they get each week.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.110
The prisoners are separated over three different
courtyards.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:35.910
Thanks to all these measures, inmates can
only ever come into contact with just a few

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.639
dozen others during their time in prison.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:42.740
Regardless of how long they may have been
in there.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:49.430
This is how La Mesa’s Director Acevedo keeps
the risk of illegal trading, fights, and weapon

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.520
or drug dealing to a minimum.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:02.329
[Voiceover]: Nowadays, we have a huge number
of rules to increase security.

00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:05.670
They enable us to keep perfect control.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:11.130
These rules didn’t exist in the past; we
had a lot more yard time but without the proper

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.130
supervision.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:17.160
Back then, a different government was ruling
Mexico and we had a lot more problems with

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:24.100
gang warfare.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:32.899
At La Mesa, the guards have lost their fight
against the inmates on more than one occasion.

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:37.029
With fatal consequences.

00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:40.290
It happened in 2008.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.790
Two riots occurred within the space of one
month.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:50.149
The first riot saw four inmates lose their
lives.

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:55.749
To punish the prisoners, water and food were
rationed.

00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:58.540
This then led to a second rebellion.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:06.939
And days of fighting.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:16.410
The prisoners’ families started to get desperate.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:21.680
No narration

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.910
Eventually, the police stormed the prison.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.490
And the outcome?

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.060
12 severely injured and 21 dead.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.670
A catastrophe.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.829
One that should never happen again.

00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:42.100
These days, the “external security” team
at La Mesa make sure – even if another riot

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:47.769
does occur – nobody manages to escape.

00:15:47.769 --> 00:15:49.389
Guards protect the outer wall.

00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:58.490
In the center of a Mexican city that is home
to millions.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:07.610
An additional safety measure: Highly trained
attack dogs in no-man’s land.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:14.029
Should worse come to worst, the guards are
equipped with both firearms and grenades.

00:16:14.029 --> 00:16:21.120
What’s more, La Mesa places its most dangerous
inmates in strict isolation – in their own

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.029
separate block.

00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:30.050
Commander Flores continues his hunt for rioters
in section 6.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:34.620
This part of the prison operates on a more
or less stand-alone basis.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:39.649
About 450 prisoners are housed in this section
alone.

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:40.649
The difference?

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:42.730
They are all ringleaders.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.399
And they work in organized cartel structures.

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:47.319
Their risk potential?

00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:48.319
Extremely high.

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:49.970
[Voiceover]:
How’s it going, everything OK?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.439
[Voiceover]:
Yes, all good so far.

00:16:53.439 --> 00:16:58.939
Francisco Javier Villa Padilla – one of
the most notorious cartel killers around.

00:16:58.939 --> 00:17:00.490
Sentenced for killing a police officer!

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.899
Other cases will follow.

00:17:03.899 --> 00:17:07.949
[Voiceover]:
Because of my crimes, the military tortured

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:10.240
me to begin with.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:18.170
They hit me, kicked me, held my head under
water, put a plastic bag over my head.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.900
They did it all.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:28.880
I killed multiple police officers, including
a high-ranking commander.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.870
It was obvious that they would have it in
for me.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:39.490
In May 2011, Francisco not only killed several
police officers; he also hung their bodies

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.240
from a bridge.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.700
A pretty brutal way of asserting your power.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.430
Back then, Francisco was working as a hit
man for the Sinaloa cartel, infamous for its

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.390
drug dealing, money laundering, and human
trafficking.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:57.550
It is regarded as the most powerful cartel
in Mexico.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:02.080
He was caught just a few days later – along
with three other gang members.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:08.410
When he was arrested, police officers recovered
five weapons, 174 rounds of ammunition and

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.230
51 bags of crystal meth, among other things.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:19.470
[Voiceover]:
I used to have an amazing life, with my family,

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.970
my kids, my wife, a girlfriend.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.320
And I had plenty of money, things were good.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:33.600
I didn’t know what it was like to go hungry
as I could always afford to buy everything.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:43.560
Here in prison, you don’t tend to get enough
and it’s usually awful.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:50.300
Catering in La Mesa is dealt with by staff
and the one hundred or so inmates with short

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.710
sentences and a low risk profile.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:19:00.010
They are the few permitted to leave their
cell for an extended period outside of yard

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:04.160
and visiting time.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.530
This scheme even allows inmates to reduce
their sentence.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:16.180
Two days of work takes one day off their time
in prison.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.410
Maximum security also applies when the food
is delivered.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:32.460
Every day, the guards check the food and staff
for smuggled goods.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.920
The prisoners prepare a good three thousand
meals, three times a day.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:45.240
They also distribute the 20 or so liters of
water per cell.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.300
There is no canteen.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.250
Food is delivered straight to the cells – by
the prisoners themselves.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:57.400
This is yet another measure that keeps contact
between guards and those inside the cells

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.290
to an absolute minimum.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:08.810
The main aim is to keep them in there as long
as possible.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:20.730
No narration

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:26.540
Strictly isolated from any form of contact:
This is a problem that the American inmates

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.050
in block one are also all too familiar with.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.360
Even if they do manage to come face-to-face
with a guard...

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.220
Almost no-one in the prison speaks English.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.420
They can do nothing but wait.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.490
No narration

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:57.340
Pretty much what they try to do here is: they
lock you up and throw away the key.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.200
Most of us don’t speak Spanish.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:05.720
They don’t understand any English, they
don’t have any interpreters or anything

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720
like that.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.429
So, as far as us, we are in trouble.

00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:12.970
There is no hope out there really.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.170
Almost no communication.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.240
And only the bare essentials needed to survive.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.330
However, even that isn’t the American inmates’
biggest fear.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:28.290
Since I have been here, from the conditions
and the medical conditions here, there’s

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:32.260
been nine people on this tier who just died
from being sick and stuff like that.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.800
That’s not including the whole jail, just
the people on this tier, on this floor right

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800
here.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:44.070
From the living conditions, from getting sick
and getting no medical attention.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:49.799
Taylor hopes to survive his time in La Mesa
– one of the world’s toughest prisons

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:50.799
– unscathed.

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:56.430
He is putting his trust mainly in God.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.030
Night falls over Tijuana.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:04.130
While the Mexican city begins to buzz with
a mix of cartel wars, drug traffickers, and

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:10.550
Americans tourists looking to party, nighttime
means one thing for the prisoners in La Mesa:

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.570
TV, electricity, and lights off.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:30.360
[Voiceover]: Turn the lights and the TV off,
time to sleep.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:40.560
No narration

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.570
The next morning.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.370
It’s the weekend.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.550
Visiting time.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.500
Around five hundred relatives flock to the
prison.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.080
Only those related by blood are permitted
entry.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:57.290
They bring clothes, hygiene products and money
to pay in for the inmates.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.410
Like Abraham’s mother Erika.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.870
She lives a few hours away.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.700
She only manages to visit her son every few
weeks or so.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.120
She knows that a visit from his family is
one of the very few chances her son gets to

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.740
leave his cell outside of yard time.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:22.110
No narration

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:29.460
Erika has been trying to get her son relocated
for a long time.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.150
To a prison where the conditions are a little
less tough.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.090
Closer to his family.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:40.100
[Voiceover]: I want my son to get out more.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.780
More yard time, more activities he can get
involved in.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.500
At the moment, he is cooped up with the other
inmates way too much.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.630
We are waiting for the process to get underway.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:58.200
It started a while back and now we need to
be patient and wait for things to move forward.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.910
Neither of the pair know if and when her application
will be approved.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:07.350
Until then, all they can do is keep persevering.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.790
Not long later and visiting hours are already
over.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.700
Under Director Acevedo’s rules, they are
restricted to just a few hours.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.740
Security comes first for him.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:24.940
Relatives repeatedly try to smuggle drugs,
tobacco or even just pens into the prison.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.400
[Voiceover]:
“When I think about where I work, the first

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.380
thing that comes to mind is that it is a huge
challenge.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.330
It’s definitely very challenging.”

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:39.630
Absolute control.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.500
Tiny cells.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.960
Constant vigilance.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.190
All tools that the prison director uses to
attempt one thing above all else: preventing

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.690
another riot.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.070
And although the prisoners aren’t allowed
out of their cells, they still train every

00:24:55.070 --> 00:25:00.230
day, particularly the inmates in high-security
block 6.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.700
Seemingly ready for battle.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.900
To do this, they go as far as creating a clear
cell schedule.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:12.520
Two inmates at a time are allowed to use the
few spare square meters to keep fit.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:21.350
Until the next time they are let out.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:30.630
And the prisoners here are subjected to even
tougher conditions than the others.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:42.280
Apart from opening cell after cell, this means
one thing above all else: More guards.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:48.740
And a physical search of every single inmate
to avoid smuggled weapons and, att all cost,

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.100
stabbings, gang warfare, and death.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:58.020
After all, inmates from the various drug cartels
come into direct contact with one another

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.020
in the yard.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.460
They only see each other for two hours a week.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:06.880
And yet, if they were out on the streets,
there’s no doubt they would be trying to

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.560
kill each other.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:26.040
No narration

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.650
Even the guards don’t enter the yard in
section 6.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:37.480
No narration

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:46.440
For the inmates, their two hours in the yard
means mainly one thing: their only chance

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.160
to contact the outside world.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.690
This wasn’t always the case.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.110
Up until 2002, La Mesa was a completely different
prison.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.990
One with hardly any guards.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.830
One where any inmate inside its walls could
do whatever he wanted.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.620
It was known as: “El Pueblito – The little
village.”

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.620
A prison town with its own rules and laws.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.920
Back then, La Mesa was ruled by the country’s
most notorious drug barons.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.830
[Voiceover]: We used to have everything, shops,
restaurants, etc.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:22.590
But there was also a huge difference between
those who had money and those who didn’t.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.750
I did well.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.310
I worked as a bodyguard for an important inmate.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.850
Even though I was constantly on the lookout
for people breathing down my neck, I was alright.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:43.530
All that is from a time that now only the
oldest inmates are able to remember.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:48.140
Like one particular inmate in section 7 – the
women’s block.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.030
Dolores Sanchez has been here since 1999.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.360
Her sentence?

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.700
34 years!

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.640
For kidnapping.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:03.290
[Voiceover]: We used to be able to just open
our cells and go wherever we wanted; we were

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.960
free.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.850
However, other things are better nowadays.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:13.940
There are no drugs, no alcohol, and no corruption
any more.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:19.600
So, it’s safer and more structured now.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.570
These days, Dolores acts as a nurse and is
permitted to issue medicines, like insulin

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:28.780
and anti-depressants, to those suffering in
the women’s block.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:34.410
And this gives her just that little bit more
freedom than most of the other inmates.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:40.980
However, Dolores still remembers when she
led a completely different life behind bars.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.090
One with an income.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.490
Along with fast-food restaurants, launderettes,
and night clubs.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.090
But also a whole lot of drug dealing and violence.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:57.910
After being built in 1956, it took the government
until 2002 to raze the “old” La Mesa to

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.290
the ground.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.650
The prison was then restructured.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:10.310
Even now, Dolores isn’t sure which of these
two worlds is better and which one is tougher.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:16.790
[Voiceover]: In those days, there were no
rules.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.980
No-one said, “you can’t assault anyone,”
“you can’t take drugs or alcohol,” “you

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.080
can’t prostitute yourself” or anything
like that.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.250
The prison management only cared about making
sure no-one escaped, that was it.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.480
We used to have computers, we had restaurants,
we all had good money.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.760
Now, there is none of that, no cash.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.600
These days, La Mesa at least has shops.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:52.710
The prison sells instant soups, snacks, and
soft drinks in each of the five yards.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:59.330
They also sell really basic items like toilet
paper – things prisoners need to buy themselves.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.130
And luxury goods, such as hair dye.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:07.720
The sales clerks are inmates like Gisell Vargos
Guerrero – sentenced to almost seven years

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.120
for possession of a weapon.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.510
Inmates pay using their fingerprints.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.220
Everything is completely electronic.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.320
The prison is a kind-of bank.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.910
This enables it to control who owns what.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.700
And it can even freeze your account.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.770
[Voiceover]:
Then you can only buy the essentials.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.650
No cookies, for instance, nothing special.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:39.110
What is sanctioned.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.780
Always in high demand: Fresh food.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.490
For the more affluent inmates.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.630
Prepared in the men’s prison kitchen.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:53.230
And during delivery, an important rule applies:
strict separation of the sexes.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.930
Men and women are banned from any contact
in La Mesa.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.560
The workers hold full responsibility for the
quality and quantity.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.600
[Voiceover]:
“I am making sure the quality is OK and

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.330
checking if there is the right number of sandwiches.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:17.290
Should any of the items go missing, Gisell
risks facing the worst punishment of them

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:24.520
all: Banishment to a place where no-one in
the whole of La Mesa wants to end up.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.910
[Voiceover]:
The punishment would be the isolation cell.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:36.450
They would cut your yard time and you wouldn’t
be able to call your family anymore.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.890
And a stay in isolation means a whole lot
more than just solitary confinement in La

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.890
Mesa.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:45.940
It’s a punishment that all inmates fear.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.980
While on the hunt for the next riot, Commander
Flores arrives at a place that not even the

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.090
guards like to visit.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:59.860
One of the prison’s isolation cells.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:04.160
No narration

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:10.630
Fighting, weapons, drugs.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.010
Anyone who breaks the prison’s rules winds
up here.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.930
And that means even less sunlight.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.310
No electricity.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:24.540
Locked away, inmates vegetate in isolation
for days on end.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:30.710
The cells are dominated by sweat, stagnant
air, and an ever-increasing amount of mold

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.890
on the walls.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.900
Inmates here even have to go without toilet
paper.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.090
They can’t be sure when they’ll be allowed
out.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.760
[Voiceover]:
The overall situation here is just a huge

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760
problem.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:54.190
It’s unbelievably hot, all you can do is
sit or stand up for a short amount of time.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:33:01.590
We’re in total isolation without any air
supply, apart from one small fan.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:10.190
They just leave us to rot away in here and
shut the doors.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:12.770
The other problem is the water.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:16.650
There isn’t running water from the tap every
day.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:22.080
Today there is, but it’s not always the
case.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:29.130
There isn’t enough to drink.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.570
Locked away.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.670
For weeks and months.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:37.100
All the inmates can do is vegetate here.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.400
Everyone in the isolation cell comes from
block 6.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.730
The block for cartel killers and serial murderers.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.470
And most of them are new arrivals.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.350
Director Acevedo is here to check the risk
status.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:58.100
After all, each one of these cells is home
to half a dozen alpha males or more.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.400
Rivalries and fights to become top dog can
spring up at any time.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.000
And this is exactly what the criminals have
been learning to deal with on the streets

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.639
of Tijuana for years.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:13.490
[Voiceover]:
Tijuana is a city where a lot happens.

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:21.550
It’s also the city with the highest number
of border crossings in the world.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:27.210
Because of that there is a lot of crime and
kidnapping here.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.869
All problems that we need to sort out.

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:36.929
What goes on outside the prison is exactly
the same as what goes on inside the prison.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:43.640
It’s just a mirror for this city.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:48.460
Outside, gang members fight each other.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.089
Inside, they have to live with their enemies.

00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:56.069
Just like cartel hit man Francisco.

00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:59.870
He shares a cell with members of other gangs.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.250
He has gradually learned to accept this fact.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:07.600
And he’s not sure if he ever wants to return
to his old life.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:13.700
Be it then or now, he has come to realize
that he has spent a lot longer living an unfree

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.950
life than the seven years he has spent in
La Mesa.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.990
[Voiceover]: I used to hunt people down to
kill them.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.980
And for that reason, I was always in danger.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.580
So, I wasn’t free on the outside either.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.200
It was also like living in a kind of prison.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.560
Francisco’s biggest worry?

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.220
He hasn’t heard anything from his family
for a long time.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.520
The only person to sometimes visit him is
his mother.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.530
Francisco believes that his kids are now criminals,
too – though he doesn’t know for sure.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.890
[Voiceover]: I’m always thinking about my
kids, my sons.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:55.860
I look at this photo every morning.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:01.260
While all Francisco has left is his photo,
Abraham in cell block one is hanging on to

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.880
one thing above all else: Hope.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.410
Finally being free.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:11.380
The 22-year-old is waiting for news from his
mother about his upcoming move to a different

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:16.090
– more lenient – prison.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:20.960
The American, Taylor, lost all feeling of
hope a long time ago.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.260
He hasn’t spoken to his family for months.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:30.530
That’s because inmates wanting to make a
phone call need the thing you need for everything

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.510
else here: Money.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.250
It sucks, it sucks.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:40.810
Everybody that I talk to here, that’s been
in jail in the States says, compared to this,

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.380
that America is like a hotel.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.250
Jails there are like a hotel.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.090
We used to have, for those phones over there,
they used to give us collect calls.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.270
So we could call the States for free.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.930
To talk to our families.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.000
But now they got rid of our collect calls.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.410
So now you have to buy phone cards, to be
able to make the calls, and like me, like

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:02.750
only one person in my cell gets money.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:04.690
Everybody else… we don’t have family here.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.770
We don’t have money, so we can’t even
talk to our families.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:11.320
And because I don’t get a deposit, most
of the wallets, the bracelets that I make

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.961
and sell, I sell for hygiene stuff.

00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:13.961
Toothpaste, toothbrush, soap.

00:37:13.961 --> 00:37:14.961
Stuff like that.

00:37:14.961 --> 00:37:15.961
Toilet paper.

00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:21.160
Because they don’t supply none of that here.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.070
Money in La Mesa is essential to survive.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:27.160
There’s not any good news for Abraham.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.170
No updates about his release.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:34.750
He uses his remaining few minutes for a couple
more calls with his brothers and sisters.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.940
[Voiceover]: These calls are important to
me.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.690
There are some family members and friends
who I haven’t seen for 3 years.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.450
Like my sisters, for example.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.170
They are growing up.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:53.850
That’s why I talk to them, to see how things
are going with them.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:59.600
They need to know that I’m still their brother
and I’m looking out for them.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.000
So now all the 22-year-old can do is wait
another week.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.850
Until the Mexican justice system decides to
grant him more freedom.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:10.080
Or not.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:15.120
Taylor is enjoying the last few rays of sunshine
with his friends from the US.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:23.770
And just keeps on holding out...

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:25.330
Nine years in this place?

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.330
Bad.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.320
Really, really bad.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.550
I mean…

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:32.000
I don’t even know.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.690
I don’t know how I feel.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.880
As of right now, I am just going with the
flow.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.640
Like, you know, another day down, another
day down.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.500
A few more to go, another day down.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.130
Just going with it you know… not trying
to think about it too much, not trying to

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.990
stress on the situation.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:58.400
Just go with it and hope it lets up.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.170
Just go with it.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:10.680
Taylor hopes that he might still get out early
for good behavior or on early release.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.480
Free time is over after two hours.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.710
It’s time for everyone to return to their
cells.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:26.940
The fate awaiting most of the inmates: Nearly
another seven days behind bars.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:32.270
To begin with, all the inmates from one cell
line up behind one another.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:37.830
Then they leave the yard together, keeping
their distance from the next group.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:38.940
Yard by yard.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:44.740
It’s a method with a system behind it.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:50.050
[Voiceover]:
We do it so that the first group finish up

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.010
their yard time first and come inside.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.760
All the others have to wait during this process.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.500
There are some inmates who have to be kept
apart at all costs.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.000
They belong to different gangs.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:13.490
From serial killer Francisco and drug trafficker
Abraham, to car thief Taylor – almost all

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:18.990
of the three thousand inmates eventually end
up behind bars again.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:24.770
For Commander Mario Flores, it is the perfect
time to start his raid.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.920
He suspects a certain cell of having home-made
weapons.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.060
No narration

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:38.300
[Voiceover]:
We’re now going into cell 11/11.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.650
One stays outside.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:46.230
The rest of the inmates are kept under control.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.050
The guards are mainly on the lookout for home-made
knives.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:53.890
Made out of toothbrushes, wires and bits of
metal.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:41:03.200
Anything the inmates could use to fight each
other – or attack the guards.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:11.820
[Voiceover]:
Get down from the beds!

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:21.690
...On the floor....Everyone on the floor...Everyone
down, everyone on the floor!

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.610
Over to the side!

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.130
[Voiceover]:: Everyone face the wall.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:38.220
[Voiceover]:
On the floor, face to the wall!

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:54.910
Then Commander Flores’ men scour the selected
cell.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:42:06.369
First the guards lead the inmates out and
subject them to a thorough search.

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:18.610
Then the troop take apart every last centimeter
of the 18 square-meter cell.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:26.860
Mattresses, shoes, magazines.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:32.350
And more.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:37.850
No narration

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.600
[Voiceover]:

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:50.610
Do you have the fan?

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:57.830
We need to open the fan!

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.680
So far, all they have are some home-made weights.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.340
Probably harmless.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:12.270
But when it comes to a fight, then they could
be a deadly weapon.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.000
Now time for the fan...

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.620
[Voiceover]:
We found this heater inside, that’s home-made.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:27.380
It might not be dangerous, but whatever.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.680
Things like this are banned in prison.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.770
[Voiceover]:
We usually find this type of thing.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:42.290
Like this thing here.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:50.710
The prisoners made this out of a toothbrush
and a piece of metal.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.710
The outcome of the raid?

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:58.470
One pen plus a small knife and a heater for
getting hot water in the cell.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:04.950
Both are home-made from bits of metal, a toothbrush
or some wires from an old fan.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:14.080
It’s all reasonably harmless.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:29.220
No narration

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.630
The punishment for this cell’s inhabitants
will be decided by the prison commission over

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:34.970
the next few days.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:39.750
Now we got to fix everything.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.610
The prisoners are likely to only get a warning.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.490
Or have their TV or yard time taken away.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:52.320
In the worst-case scenario, they could also
end up in isolation.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.790
Yet another day is coming to an end at La
Mesa.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:02.910
Another day that 22-year-old convicted drug
smuggler Abraham spent hoping that he will

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.970
soon be out of here.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:13.500
[Voiceover]: I hope to either be relocated
or maybe even released some time soon.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:17.800
I’ve noticed that people who have already
been here for three years behave differently.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:28.320
They are angrier, more impatient, they’re
in a bad mood all the time.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.680
And the Americans are trying not to back down...
particularly Taylor

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.050
You don’t want to let this place change
you.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.060
You don’t want it because it’s a shithole.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:43.060
You don’t want to let it change you.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.370
You gotta keep yourself strong.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:51.900
Like… you know what I mean?

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:56.650
Giselle – convicted for possession of a
weapon – is due to be released in a few

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:57.650
months.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.240
And she’s already planning her life.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.670
[Voiceover]: I want to start over.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.510
And have a career as a real doctor.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:13.450
I just want to start over and never look back.”

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:19.550
Dolores on the other hand has another fifteen
years left behind bars.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.720
She will be in her mid-50s by the time she
gets out.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:29.000
[Voiceover]: When I get out of here, I need
to start with coming to grips with the new

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
technology.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
So much has changed.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.119
And people have changed, too!

00:46:32.119 --> 00:46:37.650
The whole of society is different.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:44.380
And hit man Francisco isn’t really sure
if he ever really wants to be free again.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.730
[Voiceover]:
The other people I used to work with...

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:51.620
They were all killed within three months of
being released.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:56.910
They are all dead.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:01.940
Director Acevedo has managed to keep La Mesa
under control for another day.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.190
A prison in the heart of Tijuana.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.760
For a long time, a prison ruled by pure anarchy.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.210
And a prison, where many people lost their
lives in riots.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:16.350
A prison with cast-iron rules.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:17.890
Minimal freedom.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.820
And maximum surveillance.

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:27.580
No narration

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:35.290
[Voiceover]:
“I am very proud.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.830
This prison used to be notorious for its chaos.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:41.080
It was called “the little village.”

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.320
And for good reason!

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.200
It had all the qualities of a normal village.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.980
But it was not an effective prison.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:57.700
Now we have everything under control, there
is security for the inmates and for us.”

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.290
When it was known as the “little village”,
the prisoners held the real power behind these

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:07.250
walls –A place full of drugs, prostitutes,
and violence.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:11.780
Director Acevedo is keen to make sure that
nothing like this ever happens in La Mesa

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.400
again.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.540
In one of the toughest prisons in the world.
