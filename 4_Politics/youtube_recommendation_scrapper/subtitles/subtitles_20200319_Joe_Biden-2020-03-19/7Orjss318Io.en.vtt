00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.702
With the world on edge,

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:03.503
people are looking
to their leaders

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.938
for reassurance and answers.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.974
Unfortunately, we have him.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.710
So, last night, the president
held an emergency live address

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.312
from the Oval Office
to calm the nation down

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:15.182
and to find someone else
to blame.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.084
NEWSWOMAN:
Breaking news. Tipping point.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.952
President Trump
addresses the nation

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.687
on the coronavirus pandemic,

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.557
using just his second
Oval Office speech

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:25.993
to announce
the U.S. will suspend

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.861
most travel from Europe.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.797
The European Union failed
to take the same precautions

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:34.301
and restrict travel from China
and other hot spots.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.570
As a result, a large number

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.106
of new clusters
in the United States

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.175
were seeded
by travelers from Europe.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.978
This is the most aggressive
and comprehensive effort

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.048
to confront a foreign virus
in modern history.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:51.251
Okay, first of all,
it isn't a foreign virus.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.953
It's just a virus, okay?

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.722
Trump makes it sound like corona
doesn't speak English.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.557
(laughter)

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.694
And-and... And also, we can
blame Europe for many things--

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:04.031
colonialism, skinny jeans,
Piers Morgan--

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:07.401
but this virus is worldwide,
all right?

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.970
It was gonna get here
no matter what Europe did.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.240
Honestly, it's beginning to look
like shutting down borders

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.676
is just Trump's go-to solution
for everything.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.110
This is all he thinks about.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.378
"What? Problem? Shut a border.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.047
Problem? Shut a border."

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:21.982
Does he do this
in his personal life, too?

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:23.350
Yeah? Is Melania just like,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.952
"I don't love you anymore,
Donald."

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.154
And he's like,
"Close the borders.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:30.090
No one's getting in or out
of this marriage."

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.558
(laughter)

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.027
Now, Donald Trump's
presidential address

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.362
turned out to be as calming

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.698
as a pack of fireworks
dropped into a bag of cocaine,

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.534
because not only
did he surprise everyone

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.269
with this announcement

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.139
but it turns out
he almost got everything wrong.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.141
NEWSMAN: President Trump
ramping up his response

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.810
to the coronavirus outbreak,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.678
but instead of reassuring
the public,

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:55.449
he caused more confusion
than calm, like this statement.

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.585
We will be suspending all travel
from Europe

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.722
to the United States
for the next 30 days.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.390
NEWSMAN: The Department
of Homeland Security

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.658
quickly clarifying,

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.393
assuring
the travel restrictions

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:08.362
will not apply
to U.S. citizens,

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:11.365
permanent residents and some
of their family members.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:14.735
The ban instead would only
apply to foreign nationals.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.269
Trump caused more uncertainty

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.106
when he said the restriction
would apply to trade.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.808
And these prohibitions
will not only apply

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.444
to the tremendous amount
of trade and cargo

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.947
but various other things.

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:28.415
NEWSMAN:
But Trump took to Twitter

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.384
to clear up that statement,
writing, "It is..."

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:32.386
(reading):

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:44.231
President Trump
further jumbled the message

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:45.932
when he addressed
the health care costs

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.901
associated with coronavirus.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.103
Earlier this week,
I met with the leaders

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.639
of health insurance industry,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.675
who have agreed to waive
all co-payments

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.478
for coronavirus treatments.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.048
NEWSMAN: A White House official
later corrected the notion,

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:03.050
saying co-payments
would be waived

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.085
only for coronavirus tests,

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:07.487
not for treatments
of the disease.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.123
I'm-I'm sorry, but this is...

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.625
this is unbelievable.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.193
Like, I would...
I would understand

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.662
if Trump made mistakes, right,

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.264
if this whole thing
was off-the-cuff.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.632
But how is it possible

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:22.469
to get so many things wrong
in a prewritten speech?

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.839
This is crazy.
Watching an Oval address

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.542
shouldn't be a game
of two truths and a lie.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.043
(laughter and applause)

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.178
He's just up there like,

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:33.246
"The coronavirus
is very dangerous.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:34.948
"We need to be vigilant.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:38.118
And my babysitter growing up
was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar."

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.586
(laughter)

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:42.722
"God bless America."

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.092
And this misinformation
that the president spread,

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.860
it caused actual chaos, right?

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.430
The European travel ban doesn't
include American citizens,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.066
but that's not what Trump said
in his speech.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.602
So Americans
who are on vacation in Europe

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.504
rushed to the airport in a panic

00:03:57.504 --> 00:03:59.706
to fly home
before the ban took effect.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.108
Yeah, there were even reports

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:03.143
of people shelling out
thousands of dollars

00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:05.278
for a last-minute ticket
'cause they were panicking.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.147
Yeah. And then the ones
who couldn't get them,

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:08.381
they just hung off the airplane

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.850
like one of those trains
in India.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.251
(laughter)

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.186
Trump caused so much confusion

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.988
that even the coronavirus
was probably like,

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.990
"Okay, wait,
can I fly to America or not?

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.859
"Like,
I-I'm just gonna call Delta.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.160
I don't know
what's going on here."

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.428
(laughter and applause)

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.096
So, just to be clear,
Americans...

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.532
Americans can fly home
from Europe.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.000
Which, if you think about it,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.935
means they could
bring corona back.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.071
Yeah. It's not a fail-safe.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:33.440
'Cause Americans always bring
something back with them

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.875
whenever they come from Europe.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.977
Yeah, it's a thing they do,
whether it's a disease

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:38.778
or a dumb new way
to say "croissant."

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.313
(laughter)

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.748
Yeah. It's a croissant, okay?

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.783
You're from Philly. Calm down.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.153
And another thing. Another thing
that doesn't make sense

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:49.189
is that although Trump
banned travel from Europe,

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.959
he didn't ban flights
from Ireland and the U.K.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.795
And when Trump was asked
about that today,

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.999
he gave one of the strangest
explanations of all time.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.502
And one of the reasons the U.K.,
basically, has been...

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.304
Uh, it's got the border.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.872
It's got very strong borders.

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:08.575
And, uh, they're...
they're doing a very good job.

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.311
They don't have very much
infection at this point,

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.013
and hopefully,
they'll keep it that way.

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:14.381
I'm sorry, what?

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.916
(laughter)

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:19.686
The U.K. is fine
because it's got "the border"?

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.122
Other countries in Europe
also have "the border."

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.691
Unless, maybe,
does he mean the water?

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:25.892
Is that it?

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:27.527
What, does Trump think
the coronavirus

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:28.828
doesn't know how to swim?

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.363
Because that's racist.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.765
(laughter)

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.300
And also, also, I don't even...

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.101
I... Like, I can't believe
I'm saying... It's not true.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.104
The U.K. and Ireland
have more corona cases

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:41.374
than many of the countries
on that list that is banned.

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.577
So, let's just be real.

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:46.379
The reason the U.K.
and Ireland are exempt

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.249
is probably because Trump
owns golf courses there.

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.651
Yeah. Well, that's what I think.

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.620
You know,
if-if Iran thought about it,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.556
they would just put
a Trump golf course in Tehran.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.158
Yeah. They'd have
a nuclear deal tomorrow.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:00.493
Trump would just be like, "Now
you're enriching me and uranium.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.829
It's a win-win. Win-win."

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:05.098
(applause)

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.435
So... So, look,
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:10.237
President Trump's
Oval Office address last night,

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.105
it was an absolute disaster,
right?

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:14.107
But there was a silver lining.

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:16.443
Because, you see,
for some strange reason,

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:19.145
the cameras were recording Trump

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.982
before he gave his address,
all right?

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:24.317
But he didn't realize
it was rolling.

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:28.288
And so today,
we got to see the real Trump

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:31.458
when he's not
acting presidential.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:35.095
And honestly,
this was pure comedy gold.

00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:37.430
You want to do this for me,
Alex, please?

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.165
(exhales)

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.237
What's our timing?

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.706
MAN:
Two minutes and 20 seconds.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.542
Do you like the book
being on the desk or not?

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.911
Would you rather have it not be?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.046
May-Maybe it looks better.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:54.681
Gives you something up here,
right?

00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:55.982
Does it matter?

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.851
What?

00:06:57.851 --> 00:06:59.286
Oh, (bleep).

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:01.154
(laughter)

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.256
Uh-oh. I got a pen mark.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.059
Anybody have any white...
Do you have any white stuff?

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:07.994
(laughter)

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.596
"Oh, (bleep).

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:13.266
Does anyone have
any white stuff?"

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.801
First of all,

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.203
his name is Mike Pence,
okay, Mr. President?

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:19.039
(gasping, laughter)

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.307
(applause)

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:22.809
But can I just say...

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:25.779
I can safely say,

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.647
this is the first time
in my life

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:29.316
that I've seen
the deleted scenes

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.718
of a presidential address.

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:33.453
Like, America's downfall
might be scary,

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.055
but, you got to admit,
the bloopers are hilarious,

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.556
you know?

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.091
And it was-- it was really weird

00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:40.493
hearing a president
in the Oval Office say,

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:42.762
"Oh, (bleep)."

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.431
Although I guess now we know
what it sounds like

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:45.765
whenever he gets a call
from Eric.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:48.168
(groans)

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:50.637
Now, I'm-I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.039
that Donald Trump
is as freaked out by coronavirus

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.507
as regular citizens,

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.176
which is wild,
because he's the president.

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.411
And the reason I say that
is because it turns out

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.480
the cameras carried on rolling

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.283
-after Trump ended his speech,
-(gasping, laughter)

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:06.886
and-and his reaction
was priceless.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.421
God bless you,

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.256
and God bless America.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.325
Thank you.

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.533
Okay.

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:22.702
Okay.
(exhales)

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.704
(laughter)

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:29.175
Yeah...

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.044
That...

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.213
is not the sound
you want to hear

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:36.816
from a president
after a serious address.

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:40.553
FDR didn't reassure the nation
by saying,

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:44.424
"The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:46.559
"Okay, Daddy needs a margarita.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:47.961
"Can I get a margarita? Ha.

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:51.564
I need a drink. Oh, they still--
they're still here?"

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.767
So, look,
this is all to say that,

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:55.902
despite the efforts
of sports leagues,

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:58.571
amusement parks,
state and local governments,

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.774
unfortunately,
the man at the top

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:03.910
just does not seem
to have his shit together.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.946
And with coronavirus now
in full pandemic mode,

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:09.015
all I have to say to that is,

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:11.084
oh, (bleep).

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:11.918
I'm being serious,

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:15.355
leaders are afraid to just say
the thing.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.458
Because it seems callous,

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.894
but we don't want to say
the honest thing in society,

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:25.098
and that is if you're gonna
die, you're gonna die.

00:09:25.098 --> 00:09:26.566
No, because I really think it is
important

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.400
to have perspective,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.836
because death is a thing that
terrifies many of us, right?

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:32.238
But if you have perspective
in and around so many things

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.072
you start to understand,

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:33.973
so for instance here,

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:37.343
coronavirus has claimed
5,000 lives across the globe.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:39.679
5,000 people across the planet
right now.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:40.713
Yes, the number increases,

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.515
but 5,000 people across the
planet.

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.584
So I'm not saying we want
to be ignorant of all risk

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.819
and you don't want the virus to
spread

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:46.820
to those who are most
vulnerable,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.022
but it's also like it
would be good to have

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:50.557
a leader who can put
things in perspective.

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:52.225
The problem with Trump
is he's more worried

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:55.195
about how it affects the
perception of him

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:56.463
versus what he's doing.

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:57.597
This is where you realize how
important

00:09:57.597 --> 00:10:00.099
good leadership is, you
know what I'm saying?

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:03.803
Because a good leader would
set expectations for a nation

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.405
and put you in a good place.

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:08.041
The way I always think
of it is like a pilot.

00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.809
For me, the best pilots are the
ones

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:10.977
who come on and tell you,

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.213
"Hey, it's gonna be bumpy."

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.583
I love those, 'cause I
get terrified when I fly,

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:17.650
but I love it when the pilot
goes,

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.986
"Hey everybody, so it's
gonna be really bumpy

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.454
so we're gonna be suspending
service.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.523
There won't be any
meals served for a while

00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:25.825
but I'm gonna try and
get to the right altitude

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.527
and hopefully it will smooth
out.

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:29.596
And then I'll let you guys know
when

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:30.663
it's safe to stand up."

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:33.099
And then when the bumps start
you're like,

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.436
"Ah, this was the shit
he was telling us about.

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.905
Here it comes!"

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:40.006
But at least you're in the,

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.108
you're like, "Okay, okay,
okay, okay, I get what ..."

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:43.042
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:44.677
But there's nothing worse
than when you're flying

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:48.314
and the pilot comes on like,
"Nothing to worry about folks."

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.717
It's like, "Shit is shaking
right now!

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:51.551
Shit is shaking.

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:52.385
The seatbelt sign is on!"

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:55.121
And the pilot's like, "No, no,
no, there's nothing wrong."

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:56.289
"Something is wrong!

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:58.958
The flight attendant is falling,

00:10:58.958 --> 00:10:59.792
she hit the door!

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:01.561
Now she's on the ceiling."

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.862
"No, there's nothing wrong."

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:05.932
"Ladies and gentlemen take
your seats please, we're fine.

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.834
We're fine ladies and-

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.135
We're fine ladies and-"

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:11.137
No we're not fine!

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:13.473
But if you tell us ahead of
time we get ready for it,

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:15.441
we buckle our seatbelts,
everybody rides it out,

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.776
and then we get to smooth
sailing

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:19.946
and then we're on this thing
together.
