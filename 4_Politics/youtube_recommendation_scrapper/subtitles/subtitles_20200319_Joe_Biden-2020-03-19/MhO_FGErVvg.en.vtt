people<00:03:39.989><c> and</c><00:03:40.140><c> so</c><00:03:40.590><c> then</c><00:03:40.709><c> I</c><00:03:40.799><c> suspect</c><00:03:41.220><c> what</c>

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 align:start position:0%
people and so then I suspect what
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.949 align:start position:0%
people and so then I suspect what
happens<00:03:41.670><c> is</c><00:03:41.790><c> they're</c><00:03:42.000><c> using</c><00:03:42.329><c> Walmart</c><00:03:42.720><c> shares</c>

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
happens is they're using Walmart shares
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
happens is they're using Walmart shares
instead<00:03:43.350><c> of</c><00:03:43.440><c> Amazon</c><00:03:43.890><c> shares</c><00:03:44.190><c> as</c><00:03:45.049><c> yeah</c><00:03:46.049><c> and</c>

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 align:start position:0%
instead of Amazon shares as yeah and
 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.390 align:start position:0%
instead of Amazon shares as yeah and
what<00:03:46.590><c> would</c><00:03:46.709><c> you</c><00:03:46.799><c> rather</c><00:03:46.950><c> have</c><00:03:47.160><c> quite</c>

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
what would you rather have quite
 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.650 align:start position:0%
what would you rather have quite
honestly<00:03:47.670><c> and</c><00:03:47.850><c> so</c><00:03:47.940><c> I</c><00:03:47.970><c> just</c><00:03:48.420><c> think</c><00:03:48.600><c> what</c>

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
honestly and so I just think what
 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
honestly and so I just think what
happens<00:03:48.989><c> is</c><00:03:49.170><c> it's</c><00:03:50.010><c> a</c><00:03:50.160><c> great</c><00:03:50.400><c> foothold</c><00:03:50.880><c> for</c>

happens is it's a great foothold for
 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.180 align:start position:0%
happens is it's a great foothold for
