00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.540
Gas stations line the roads and
highways across the United States,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.150
fueling the country's
cars and trucks.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.410
93% of Americans live within
10 minutes of one.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.790
They arguably comprise one of the
most important retail businesses in the

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.830
country. There are 152,000 convenience
stores in the US.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.860
That's 30% of all
stores in the country.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.720
Put another way, one out of
every three stores in the U.S.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.070
is a convenience store.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.370
It's a $654 billion industry.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.480
But those who follow it say most
Americans know very little about it.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.610
And it's actually
rather misunderstood.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.870
While convenience store retailing has so
far been spared the sometimes

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.740
catastrophic disruptions that have hit
other segments of retail, the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.340
fuel and convenience business is going
through some profound changes of

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.630
its own. For much of their history,
gas stations have been, and still

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.780
are today, small,
locally owned businesses.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.070
For their owners, they often represent
a path toward the American dream.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.550
One of the things that a lot
of folks don't actually realize is that

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.600
almost two-thirds of the industry
is still single-store owner operated.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.660
Meaning that your local gas station may
be owned by somebody who lives at

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.600
the end of your street. But
in recent years, the industry has

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.070
increasingly gone corporate.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.050
The smallest companies, those with
anywhere from 100-200 stores, are

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.920
being bought up by bigger chains or
are otherwise going out of business.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.010
And it is getting harder for
the little guy to survive.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.660
The first commercial fuel pump in the
United States was sold to an

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.150
Indiana grocery store in 1885.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.940
The kerosene pump was invented
by a man named Sylvanus

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.910
Freelove Bowser. He patented his
design two years later.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.740
The first dedicated gas station
opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania within

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.990
two decades. But it wasn't until the
1970s when modern fuel retailing as

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.210
we know it today began to emerge.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.610
The first oil embargo in the 70s
really set the stage for convenience

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.960
stores to sell fuel. There was
technology to sell fuel, but people

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.940
didn't really consider 'I can pump my own
gas and save a cent a gallon'

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.840
or something like that. But that
first oil embargo really changed the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.580
philosophy of people, 'I'll pump
gas, I'll save a cent.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.170
Take the cost out of the
system, it goes to the customer.'

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.480
The second oil embargo in 1979 raised
the price of fuel above one dollar

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.510
for the first time, a huge
price hike for the era.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.860
Up to that point, fuel stations had
been more like service stations, but

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.690
convenience stores began using a self-serve
model that is common in 48

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.310
out of 50 states today.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.560
Only Oregon and New Jersey still require
a gas station attendant to pump

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.120
a customer's gasoline.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.700
That brings us to today.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.850
There are basically three places
a customer buys fuel.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.760
80% of convenience stores have fuel pumps
attached and 80% of the gas in

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.310
the country is sold
at convenience stores.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.150
The other 20% is sold
at standalone gas stations.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.570
These are often attached to a
traditional service station that does

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.950
repairs and inspections.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.420
The other channel is what is called
the hypermarket, a term for big box

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.780
stores such as Costco,
Wal-Mart and Sam's Club.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.280
These outlets sell three times the
volume of a typical convenience store,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.170
but there are only a few of them,
so they comprise only about 10-15% in

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.940
terms of overall fuel sales.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.610
As of December 2019, there
were 152,720 convenience stores

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.670
operating in the United States, down
less than 1% from the 153,237

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.550
stores in 2018.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.670
I'd say the landscape of ownership and
fuel and convenience can be very

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.940
hard to understand at times, and
it can actually get very complicated.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.650
There's many different models here.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.120
There are more than 100,000 distinct
companies in the convenience and

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.460
fuel retailing industry
across the U.S.,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.250
more than in any
other sector of retail.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.840
62.1% of the market is
made up of single-store owners.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.950
That is, as it sounds, owners
who own just one store.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.700
It is somewhat difficult to see this
since many, if not most fuel

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.900
stations often bear some kind of
corporate logo, typically from a

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.660
petroleum company such as
Shell or Chevron.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.020
Despite the corporate logo, though,
these are still independently owned

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.580
businesses. Owners of these stores often
have some kind of franchise

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.870
deal with the fuel provider to share
costs, but the stores are not owned

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.550
by the oil and gas companies.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.820
The other 37.9%

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.700
of the convenience and gas station
market is controlled by larger chains,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.530
which includes familiar corporate brands such
as 7-Eleven and Circle K.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.400
But most of the chains in
convenience and fuel retail are regional.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.770
WaWa, Sheetz, Race Trac, and Casey's
General Store are all brands

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.930
well-known in different regions
of the country.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.090
About 15% of the total market is
controlled by chains that are 500 stores

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.810
or more, and most of those are
regional chains with a few national

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.650
brands thrown in. But that share
of the market is growing.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.900
In 2019, the largest chains
added 312 stores over the

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.890
previous year and the second largest tier
of companies in terms of store

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.340
count added 134 stores.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.420
Every other tier lost stores with
the biggest losses among independently

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.440
owned stores.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.570
Part of the reason for this change is
what the stores are selling and how

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.330
they look is changing
dramatically as well.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.740
As these businesses move away from
the “cokes, smokes, and gasoline”

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.600
model, and more into products like
fresh prepared food, some independent

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.480
and smaller owners are having
a hard time keeping up.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.200
Right now what we're seeing is
some of these one-store operators are

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.980
finding it a little bit harder to
stay in business with some of these

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.500
companies that are continuing to up the
ante on food, because people are

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.160
time starved. When they come to buy
gas, they're often looking to solve

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.260
other problems. 'Can I
get a sandwich?

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.310
Can I get a drink?

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.840
Can I get all these other things?'

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.120
And the the one-store, and
the one-stop shopping v

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.060
alue is just increasing more
and more and more.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.660
And that puts pressure on the
smaller operators that maybe focus more

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.150
on, 'hey, I have a gas
price and a good location.'

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.410
Convenience stores now also have
to worry about competition from

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.490
retailers in adjacent segments of retail,
especially those who might be

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.320
getting pelted with
their own competition.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.130
Convenience stores are so named because
they offer convenience and they

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.620
are built around getting customers in
and out of the store.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.430
The typical visit to a convenience store
lasts about three minutes and 30

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.560
seconds. But the rise of e-commerce,
store apps and other technological

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.010
innovations have left consumers accustomed to
a whole new level of

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.190
convenience that challenges the relevance
of the traditional convenience

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.050
store. Convenience channel is really
being influenced by companies

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.540
outside the convenience channel that are
providing more easier ways for

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.130
consumers to be ordering in advance, to
allow them to to walk in and

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.270
pick-up a product, pre ordered.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.820
And so when people think of
convenience, that's their new level of

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.550
convenience. So they're
expecting that now.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.250
So the convenience channel has
to adjust to do that.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.720
Amazon Go opened stores in certain
cities around the country that you

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.020
use your app to log in, pick
products off a shelf and you leave.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.440
The internet and smartphones have also
gobbled up whole categories of

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.900
merchandise that convenience stores
once depended on.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.770
When you look at stores 20 years ago,
some of the top selling items that

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:56.050
you saw were film, maps, and
a substantial amount of foot

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.700
traffic, as we all know, with somebody
walking in and saying, hey, how

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.750
do I get to here?

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.740
And those directions, somebody would also say,
hey, let me get a drink

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.020
while I'm in here. All that's gone.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.270
What's the next thing
that could be replaced?

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.480
There are other changes taking place
that stand to further alter the

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.800
landscape. One such switch is the move
away from fuel and toward cars

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.120
with electric power trains.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.230
Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk has spoken
about the kinds of experiences he

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.580
envisions for Tesla's Supercharger stations
where just mostly filling

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.330
the battery on a car can take
at least 20 to 30 minutes.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.560
That stands to change how stores think
about how they draw people in and

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.430
hold their attention. It might
require redesigning stores, offering more

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.350
in-store experiences and so on.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.640
So the question is: how does a
store survive in this changing landscape?

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.200
Some are doing it by trying to
outwork the problem, by, for example,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.310
hiring family to keep the store
running, keeping their labor costs low.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.570
But whereas convenience stores used to
survive by being pretty standard

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.650
in what they offered.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.420
Fuel, of course, is a commodity.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.940
But the store offer was almost a
commodity and the way it was

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.040
experienced. The same the same snacks,
the same beverages, the same

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.220
experience, really. It was the same
from one store to the other.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.220
We're entering an era now, though,
where the leading brands are

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.530
differentiating themselves
very strongly.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.430
And you see this at the corporate level,
but you also see this with the

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.990
successful independent retailers.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.580
Brands that are thriving now are
differentiating themselves and many are

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.500
starting to look
more like restaurants.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.160
Historically, there is a bit of a
bias against food bought at gas

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.720
stations. Many now well-known regional chains
grew out of that initial

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.560
complex environment where some stores began
selling gas and some gas

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.150
stations began selling food.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.430
For example, Wawa has built a
reputation for its sandwiches and coffee.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.940
Independent stores are carving out
their own niches as well.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.570
High Country Market and Gastropub
is one such business.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.250
Located in Round Rock, Texas, the store
is a destination for food, craft

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.800
beer and high-end wine.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.840
And it is attached to a gas station.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.690
Before it was a gas station,
regular convenience store, and people would

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.660
come in just buy like
chocolates and buy little things;

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.950
if they wanted any medicine, if
there weren't any bread, milk, bandages

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.090
or Band-Aids or whatever.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.350
It was...it

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:28.780
started as a proper convenience store
with a restaurant, a diner and

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.090
a small beer bar/wine bar.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.510
But he found it difficult to
distinguish himself from the competition, so

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.110
he diversified. If you want
various kinds of good waters,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.540
Kombuchas, at least 10 types of
organic sodas, or regular sodas,

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.970
I will have those.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.330
Walji said many other convenience store
owners who have sought him out

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.870
for advice on transforming their
own businesses sometimes seem

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.050
intimidated by the investments
and the work involved.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.840
Others lack the knowledge
for making the transition.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.650
Many businesses also simply don't have
the space High country has.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.180
Maybe I'm maybe a jack-of-all-trades, but
it separates me from the guy

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.040
who's just going in to buy either a
lottery ticket, cash a check or buy

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.430
a Coca-Cola walking out.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.560
In a market that is crowded, changing,
and like the rest of retail, more

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.990
than a bit uncertain, it
helps to be creative.
