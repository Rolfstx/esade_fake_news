00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.649
Bernie Sanders represents Vermont in the U.S. Senate

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.480
but you probably noticed — 
SANDERS:“Millionaihs and Billionaihs”

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.669
— that his voice represents another place
entirely. And another time.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:19.300
“New York City: Where the world’s nations
sit side by side”

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.179
Sanders grew up in Brooklyn in the 40s and 50s.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.029
The city had long ago developed a distinctive
accent. Surprisingly, its features can be

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.550
traced back to the early English settlers
rather than the big waves of immigration that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.180
came later. NEWMAN: “The most famous feature of the New York City

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.210
accent is what linguists call the ‘thought’
vowel -- and I just said it in a very New

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.340
York way.
SANDERS: “Tawk the issues to the people” “And

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.000
second of awl” “There is a brawd consensus”

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.170
When Bernie Sanders says these words, the
position of the vowel is raised.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.239
What does that mean? For me it was helpful
to look at this chart of vowel sounds.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.949
It’s shaped like this because it’s basically
a diagram of your mouth, with the vowels mapped

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.410
according to the position of your tongue when
you say them.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.979
Try saying eeee and oooo and pay attention
to your tongue. Eee-ooo. No, really, try it.

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.869
eee-ooo-eee-ooo. It’s moving forward and
back, but it can also move up and down.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:24.680
Without moving your jaw too much try aaa-eee.
aaa-eee-aaa-eee. Researchers measure the position

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.930
of these sounds by analyzing their frequencies.
So what’s happening with the New York City

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.740
“thought” vowel is that it stays back
but moves up.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.500
Instead of “thought” you get “thawt”
This feature is becoming less distinct with

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.810
each generation, according to a recent survey
of native New Yorkers — particularly among

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.680
white people.
The more recent the birth year, the lower

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.640
the “thought” vowel. It goes from cawfee
to coffee.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.270
“So the cawf - none of my nephews or nieces
will say it that way”

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.829
You can also hear Bernie Sanders’ New York
roots in his Rs ...or actually his lack of

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:58.469
Rs.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.020
“Democratic pahty” “Our computas”
“Denmahk” “In Novembah”

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.320
Like dialects from Boston “Are you a nahk?”
and Savannah “I like to drive undah the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.250
speed limit”, the New York City accent is
historically non-rhotic,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.420
meaning Rs often get dropped, except before
vowels.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.920
So newscasters call him “Bernie Sanders”
but he calls himself “Bernie Sandahs.”

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.250
R-dropping is something that became fashionable
in London in the late 1700s before spreading

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.010
to the East Coast of the US.
“There must be an end to speculation with

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.530
othah people’s money.”
But now, it too is fading.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.720
NEWMAN: “Particularly after the second world war
it lost its prestige. “

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.880
Americans were focused on their own identity
rather than maintaining ties to England.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.890
And as pop culture increasingly portrayed
New Yorkers as criminals, the stigma led some

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.740
to intentionally lose their accents.
As with all dialects, the New York City accent

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.190
is more pronounced among the working class.
Which may help explain why Sanders — who

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.480
grew up in a lower-middle class home — has
a heavier accent than Donald Trump, also a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.410
native New Yorker. "Law enforcement. "Law enforcement."
But the accent also varies by ethnicity. So,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.170
many people might recognize Sanders’ Jewish intonations.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.360
“My name is rabbi Manny Shevitz.”
One thing you might notice is the Ts at the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.750
end of some his words.
“Profound and important.”

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.590
NEWMAN: “Normally you wont say the T very much.
You’ll say, ‘where’d you go?’ ‘I

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.500
left.’ But you would rarely say ‘I lefT.’
And It’s kind of typical of Jews to do that,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.390
to say ‘I lefT.’”
SANDERS: “This country, in facT.” “I very much

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.090
rejecT.”
But it’s also in the pacing and the rise

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.080
and fall of how he speaks.
Which is why, to do a really good Bernie Sanders,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.440
it helps if you’re also a Jew from 1950s
working-class Brooklyn.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.090
DAVID: “This may not be great politics, but I think the American people are sick and tired of

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:59.770
hearing about your damn emails.”

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.630
One of the things both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are known for is their pronunciation of the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.590
“hyu” sound. SANDERS: “A yooge voter turnout. And I say yooge!”

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.040
Why do New Yorkers drop the h at the front
of the word? Well the answer seems to be that

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.609
it takes less energy to say yooge than huge.
Consider another H that most of us have dropped

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.340
— the H one in what, where and when. Back
before the 18th century, it was considered

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.410
uneducated speech to say what instead of hwhat.
Maybe in the future all English-speaking yoomans

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.790
will say yooge.
