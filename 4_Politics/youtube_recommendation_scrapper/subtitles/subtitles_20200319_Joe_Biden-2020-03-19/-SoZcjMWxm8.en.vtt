-Hey, everybody.

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:05.238
Welcome to "Late Night"
Casual Thursday.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.407
[ Laughter ]

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:10.609
So, we were planning
on doing our show tonight

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.446
and then, on Monday,
we were gonna start doing shows

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.315
without an audience,
but, basically,

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.883
things are moving very fast --
I don't need to tell you that --

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:21.287
and our guests,
with great reason,

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:24.156
decided that they
didn't feel right,

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:25.291
coming in and doing
the show tonight,

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.728
so we decided to cancel it
and we don't know

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.763
when we are gonna start
doing shows again.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.699
But, we had written
"A Closer Look" last night

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.468
and the "Closer Look" is about

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.170
everything that's
happening right now

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.339
and, really, the reason we're
gonna do this right now is that,

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.910
once it's on the cards,
Wally makes us do it.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.249
[ Laughter ]

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.286
So, here's the "Closer Look"
that was written last night

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.555
about the president's address
to the nation...

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.124
And, uh, yeah.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.526
Go to the next one, Wally.
Sorry I jumped ya.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.895
...and the administration's
failed response to the pandemic

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.064
and we thought we should go
ahead and do it, so,

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:07.166
for more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.871
[ Suspenseful theme plays ]
[ Cheering and applause ]

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.806
So, we're in this weird
moment, right now,

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.409
where it's difficult for the
media and public health experts

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.211
to convey the severity
of what's happening

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.645
without sounding hysterical.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.048
It's like being the one person
in a horror movie

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.750
who knows they're
in a horror movie.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.153
Like all the sexy teens are
like, "Guys, I have an idea.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.455
Let's go skinny dipping in the
pool during the full Moon,"

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.390
and then there's a doctor
in a lab coat standing there,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.960
screaming,
"Statistically speaking,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.628
this is werewolf time!"

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.130
[ Laughter ]
Public health experts
are warning us

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.365
that we're failing badly

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.267
and those are the people
we need to listen to.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.569
For example, one said today
"the lack of testing

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.204
in the United States
is a debacle,"

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.707
and another said, "This is
an unmitigated disaster

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.042
that the administration has
brought upon the population,"

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.510
and, on top of that,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.447
things just feel very surreal
and weird right now.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.550
Case in point: If you tuned in
a few minutes early

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.818
to watch the president's
address to the nation

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:03.922
at 9:00 pm last night and you
chose to watch it on Fox,

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:07.393
you would've caught the tail end
of "The Masked Singer,"

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.929
in which case, this is
what you would've seen moments

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.331
before the president addressed
a worried nation

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.632
from the Oval Office.

Yeah, we're sprung.

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:30.416
That is Sarah Palin singing
"Baby Got Back."

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.918
That was so depressing,
Sir Mix-a-Lot immediately wrote

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:35.254
a sequel called
"Baby Got Prozac."

[ Laughter and ohs ]
Also, if we're

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:38.991
encouraging people
to avoid large crowds,

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.426
I'm not sure
it's the right message

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:43.663
to promote a song
by someone named Mix-a-Lot.

I should let you know,

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.349
The weirdest thing
about that clip was

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.118
that the president
immediately followed it up

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.921
by giving his speech
as the Frog.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.889
[ Laughter ]
So that's what you saw,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.190
if you tuned in
to the speech early,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.159
but, if you watched it on C-SPAN
and stayed until the end,

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.361
you might've seen
an equally weird moment

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.597
when C-SPAN forgot
to turn the feed off

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:18.698
and we got to see a rare glimpse

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.300
of the president
after his speech was over.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.802
Now, during the speech,
you could see

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.004
just how hard Trump
was straining

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.273
to read the teleprompter
and strike a somber tone.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.541
I mean, look at him.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.377
He looks like a long-haul
trucker blastin' the radio

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.212
and slappin' himself
in the face to stay awake.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.548
[ Laughter ]
If you walked in
on your teenage son

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.217
and his buddies in the basement
and their eyes looked like that,

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:41.587
you'd immediately say, "Alright,
who brought the doobies?"

He should be surrounded
by a cloud of pot smoke.

So, Trump's face was frozen
in this bizarre, forced grimace

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.003
in a desperate attempt
to project strength

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.837
amid his flailing response
to the pandemic.

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:00.907
But then,
after the speech ended,

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.776
C-SPAN forgot to cut the feed
and this happened.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.413
-We're clear.
-Okay.

00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:12.451

reacted to it.

and deliberately attacked

of the empire of Japan.

a rare glimpse of Trump

00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:43.950
dropping the act of pretending
to be a competent person.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.884
When he's trying
to act like a president,

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:47.686
he tightens his face
and narrows his eyes

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:49.388
and then, when he thinks
the cameras are off,

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:53.358
he's like a grandpa unbuckling
his belt after a big meal.

Ohh! That Sizzler buffet
did not know what was coming.

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:01.200
The relief on Trump's face
was palpable,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.435
probably because he struggled,
as usual,

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.938
to squint his way through
a prepared teleprompter speech

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.340
without screwing up,
and, yet, he repeatedly failed.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.809
Right off the bat,
for example,

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.278
he had trouble reading
the word "continuing,"

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:13.579
and, in his usual style,

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.382
tried to pretend his mistake
was actually correct.

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.817
-I am confident that by counting

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:21.954
and continuing to take
these tough measures --

-I'm starting
to think the president

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.892

You can't start a sentence
with the words "I am confident,"

if you're not even confident
you can make it

through the sentence
without screwing up.

inspire confidence,

was the fact that Trump said

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:23.949
multiple things in his speech

about the usual stuff,

like the fact
that he lies nonstop.

I mean he got
his own policies wrong,

several clarifications

all travel

from Europe to the United States
for the next 30 days

will not only apply

to the tremendous amount
of trade and cargo,

exceptions.

He didn't spell them out,

who are adequately screened

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:04.623
will be excepted from that,
and something about cargo.

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:06.358
I'm not exactly --
It wasn't clear.

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:08.961
-Within the past hour,
the acting deputy secretary

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.630
of Homeland Security
posted a tweet saying

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.067
the travel restrictions don't
apply to American citizens

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:18.537
or legal permanent residents
or their families,

00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:20.506
which makes it difficult
to exactly see

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:22.407
how this will prevent
the spread of the virus.

00:07:22.407 --> 00:07:24.210
Also, the White House
issued a clarification,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.144
saying the president misspoke

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:29.081
and the ban does not apply
to cargo, either.

Millions of people are

without paid sick leave
and health insurance,

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.615
and layoffs
and workplace closures

could leave working people
struggling to make ends meet.

those people

the Trump administration

00:14:50.922 --> 00:14:54.392
is still moving forward
with a truly sadistic plan

00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:57.729
to kick 700,000 people
off food stamps,

00:14:57.729 --> 00:15:00.999

at a time when the nation
is looking for guidance,

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.576
so, now, it's up to the media,
public health officials,

00:15:44.576 --> 00:15:47.313
workplaces, and individuals
to take this seriously,

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:50.115

where the president is failing.
