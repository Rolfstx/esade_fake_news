00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 align:start position:0%
that is is quite difficult and we think
 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
that is is quite difficult and we think
it's<00:04:29.030><c> working</c><00:04:29.449><c> out</c><00:04:29.569><c> for</c><00:04:29.780><c> the</c><00:04:29.900><c> self</c><00:04:30.169><c> swab</c><00:04:30.439><c> and</c>

it's working out for the self swab and
 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.929 align:start position:0%
it's working out for the self swab and
if<00:04:33.229><c> it</c><00:04:33.560><c> would</c><00:04:33.710><c> test</c><00:04:33.949><c> positive</c><00:04:34.159><c> the</c><00:04:34.669><c> people</c>

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:34.939 align:start position:0%
if it would test positive the people
 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
if it would test positive the people
would<00:04:35.060><c> go</c><00:04:35.240><c> and</c><00:04:35.479><c> they</c><00:04:36.289><c> would</c><00:04:36.319><c> do</c><00:04:36.560><c> what</c><00:04:36.740><c> they</c>

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 align:start position:0%
would go and they would do what they
 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.230 align:start position:0%
would go and they would do what they
have<00:04:37.009><c> to</c><00:04:37.159><c> do</c><00:04:37.310><c> is</c><00:04:37.460><c> but</c><00:04:37.729><c> we</c><00:04:37.849><c> think</c><00:04:38.060><c> that's</c>

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
have to do is but we think that's
 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.029 align:start position:0%
have to do is but we think that's

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
your question because it allows me to

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:11.790 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to understand what
 

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to understand what
those<00:51:11.940><c> relationships</c><00:51:12.210><c> are</c><00:51:13.050><c> we're</c><00:51:13.500><c> very</c>

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:13.770 align:start position:0%
those relationships are we're very

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:15.690 align:start position:0%
interested in the curves in Italy
 

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.890 align:start position:0%
interested in the curves in Italy
because<00:51:16.320><c> of</c><00:51:16.760><c> their</c><00:51:17.760><c> different</c><00:51:18.180><c> approach</c><00:51:18.570><c> and</c>

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
because of their different approach and
 

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.630 align:start position:0%
because of their different approach and
we're<00:51:19.020><c> following</c><00:51:19.260><c> every</c><00:51:19.590><c> single</c><00:51:20.130><c> country's</c>

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're following every single country's
 

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:23.450 align:start position:0%
we're following every single country's
curves<00:51:21.000><c> and</c><00:51:21.360><c> so</c><00:51:21.960><c> all</c><00:51:22.410><c> we</c><00:51:22.680><c> can</c><00:51:22.830><c> do</c><00:51:22.980><c> is</c><00:51:23.100><c> look</c><00:51:23.280><c> at</c>

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.870 align:start position:0%
