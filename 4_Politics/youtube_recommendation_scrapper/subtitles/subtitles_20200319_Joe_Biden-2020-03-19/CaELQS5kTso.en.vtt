00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.676
(dramatic music)

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.745
- What if I told you
there's a magical

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.214
but completely
misunderstood place,

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.016
where seemingly
all the smart money

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.118
in the world is
beginning to flow.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:21.855
- You walk down the street,
you go to a different city,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.656
and you say, my God,
last time I was here,

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:26.559
five years ago, none
of this was here.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.628
- It's a place where people
are getting wealthier

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.196
like never before.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.233
Where more millionaires and
billionaires are being created

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.602
than anywhere else on earth.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:40.073
- That transformation is
probably the most rapid

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.576
and significant, I think
in humankind, ever.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.612
- It will probably
come as no surprise,

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.715
that the world's richest and
most successful individuals

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.584
have already discovered
this miraculous place.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.888
People like Warren Buffet,
Charlie Munger, Bill Gates,

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:59.859
George Soros, Elon Musk, Jeff
Bezos, Jim Rogers and more.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.496
And the money being
made here is incredible.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.432
I'll share how one
man, for example,

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.000
even found a clever way

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.871
to turn $200 into a
$1 million payday.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.406
- In my personal opinion,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.942
I think this is once in a
million years opportunity.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.813
- But here's the irony, in
this land of vast new riches,

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:23.083
money no longer exists
in the traditional sense.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.985
There's never a line at the
few remaining ATM machines,

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:29.089
no one carries a wallet and
fewer still write checks

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.958
or carry dollar bills,
credit cards or coins.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.160
Instead, there's
a radical new type

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.197
of currency exchange used
to pay for everything.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.165
- I don't need to
carry a wallet at all.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.533
I mean literally,
no cash at all.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.335
- So you don't carry any cash?

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.838
- No, no, I can
live like every day.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.107
- No credit cards?
- No, no.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.609
- You're about to see
this place in person.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.144
I'm going to take you there.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:54.280
And as you'll see, in many
ways it's more advanced

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.916
than anything you're
probably familiar with.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.651
You'll see stores
without employees,

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.453
buses that drive themselves,

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.123
facial recognition
security and a string

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.691
of other new
breakthroughs and trends

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.060
that are light years
ahead of where you live.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.596
- This technology
and product hunger

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.897
is really unparalleled.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:14.300
It's not seen
anytime, anywhere else

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.902
in the world and in history.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.972
- But what really sets this
place apart is the money.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.475
Both the money pouring in
and the money being made.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.311
- There is the greatest
wealth creation event

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.147
in the history of
the world, frankly,

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.182
happening right here, right now.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.384
- Now to truly understand
and take advantage

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:32.752
of what's happening here,

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.321
you really have to see
this place for yourself.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.557
So I'm about to give
you that opportunity

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.692
as I take you there in person,

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:43.129
to show you the most
misunderstood place in the world

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.567
and the greatest money-making
opportunity of our lifetimes.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.804
(dramatic music)

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.079
Hi, my name is Steve Sjuggerud,

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.781
I'm a former hedge fund manager

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.050
but I'm excited today
to play tour guide

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.586
and take you on this
incredible adventure.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.922
Right now, I'm at
the Newark Airport,

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.624
I left my island home in
Florida early this morning

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.526
and now I'm about
to hop on a plane

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.829
and take you to this place
where so much money is flowing,

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.566
so much wealth is being created

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:23.136
and where you really can get
a glimpse into the future.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.472
But before we go forward,
you need to first step back.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.309
(dramatic music)

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.579
This is a journey that I
started more than 20 years ago

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.348
and have continued many
times in recent years.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:39.219
Every time I come here,
I'm even more amazed.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.088
What I've realized is there's
never been a bigger distortion

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:46.392
between perception and reality
than I see in this place,

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.528
right here, right now.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.464
What people think about this
place is nothing even close

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.534
to what it really is,
or what it's becoming.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.938
So what is this place that
I've been talking about?

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.674
(tense music)

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.143
Well as you can probably tell
from what you see behind me.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:05.979
We are in China.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.414
I'm standing on the
Great Wall of China

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.116
in a place called Mutianyu,

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.952
roughly 50 miles
north of Beijing.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:15.188
This section of the
wall was built beginning

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:19.058
more than 600 years
ago, back in the 1300s.

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:21.261
Isn't this place incredible?

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:25.531
On a clear day, you can
see for over 20 miles.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.233
But here's the incredible thing.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.736
China is not only
radically different

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.205
from the place it
was 600 years ago.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.540
It is also completely
different from the place

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.776
it was just a generation ago,

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.911
even from a political
point of view.

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.513
- They call
themselves communists,

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.682
but they are probably
the best capitalists

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:45.985
in the world in 2018/2019.

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:49.722
California is more
communist than China is,

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:52.825
Massachusetts is more
communist than China.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.827
- And this incredible adaptation

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:57.530
of capitalism has
transformed the country

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.699
in just a single generation.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.435
People who are my age,
in their 40s and 50s,

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.171
grew up in a very
different time.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.775
In Beijing, I met with a
successful hedge fund manager

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:12.312
and the stories he told
me were incredible.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.947
- When I was a kid,
when I read book,

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:18.418
we do not have
electricity, at the night,

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:21.054
I need to use candle.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.456
- I heard the same
story again and again

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.693
as I met with some of China's
most successful people.

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.696
- When I grew up, which
was, I was born in '75,

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.799
and lived in China
til the age of 10,

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.501
in Guangdong Province
which is fairly poor.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.204
The fact that everyone
was poor in China.

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:40.707
And we still had to
have rations, you know,

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:43.643
like coupons for meat, for eggs,

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:46.746
for material to
make clothing with

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.682
and you're lucky if you had
one new outfit per year.

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.084
- Coupons.
- Yes, exactly.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.653
(bright music)

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.757
- Fast forward 40 years
and here is a glimpse

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:01.060
of China today, after years
of lightening fast growth.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.997
(upbeat music)

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.373
Investing legend Jim Rogers
has been here all along

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.275
and watched that explosive
growth happen firsthand.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:19.312
- First came here in
1984, I was terrified,

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:22.648
because I'd been listening
to American propaganda,

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.250
the Chinese were evil, vicious,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.386
dangerous, blood-thirsty people.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.855
Didn't take me long of
traveling around China

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.790
to find out they're disciplined,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.427
educated, ambitious,
hard working.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:37.163
- Jim Rogers probably
knows China more deeply

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:39.365
than any other American today.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.401
When he came here
in the early '80s,

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:45.004
he traveled the entire
country by motorcycle,

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.607
not once but twice.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.609
He'll never forget what he saw.

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:51.043
- I mean, it was amazing,

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:55.782
everybody was up early,
working and they didn't stop.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.717
They worked all
day and all night,

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:00.486
they were saving, they
were recycling everything.

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:03.322
They weren't doing it to to
be, to save the environment.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.426
They were doing it to
make money in those days.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.394
And I could just see,
it was everywhere,

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.930
I could see the
sense of education,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.298
I could see the ambition,

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.300
I could see the sense

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.136
that our children should
have a better life.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.571
I mean, it was just everywhere.

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:21.140
(gentle music)

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.278
- Peter Churchouse
is another person

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.880
who has seen China
like few others.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.917
He's a successful businessman
who arrived in Hong Kong

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.152
in 1980 and soon went on

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:36.322
to run Morgan Stanley's
Asia division.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.592
He was there long before the
explosive growth of China

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:42.395
and he's seen it all
happen firsthand.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:44.163
- I came to Hong Kong in 1980,

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.066
so I've been here
nearly 39 years now.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:50.169
I came to help build a new town

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.271
in the new territories
in Hong Kong.

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.541
And at that time,
Shenzhen, which is the city

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:58.911
just north of Hong Kong,
that city was not a city,

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.348
it was a village of
about 300,000 people.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.284
And you walked around that
village, there were people,

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:08.788
blacksmiths beating charcoal
implements in the street.

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.824
There were no buses,
no taxis, no cars.

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:14.994
(upbeat techno music)

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:20.099
Now it's city of
11 million people,

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:24.103
it's the center of the biggest
manufacturing conglomeration

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.671
in the planet.

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:30.543
That area now had a GDP
roughly the size of Russia.

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.477
- Wow.

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.012
- Slightly smaller than Spain.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:36.048
And there was nothing, it
had nothing 38 years ago.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.950
So that's kind of--
- It's home to potentially

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.485
the highest tech
company in the world.

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:43.789
- Oh, yes, I mean, so many
of the China and European

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.859
and American tech companies
have their operations based

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:49.061
in that area.

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:53.099
66 million people in
that area right now.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:56.769
It has the biggest manufacturing
center in the world.

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:00.840
It has 400 million
air passengers flying
through that place.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.175
- So why does so few
Americans know the truth

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.511
about what's happening
in China today.

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.380
- Most Americans really
know what they know

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.916
about China through
the lens of the media.

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:13.452
- China is really going in
extremely dangerous directions.

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:17.023
- This is a country that is
ripping off the United States.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.624
- The biggest threat,
obviously, is China.

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:23.629
- So you end up having sort
of a warped view on China,

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.098
that tends to have
more negative.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.968
Not structural,
it's not malicious

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:33.072
and so I think a lot of
Americans can be excused

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.875
for having certain
preconceptions about
what China's like.

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.878
- What I tell Americans
about the negative press,

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:41.147
is I think the media
does a disservice.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:45.685
There's a lot of, you know,
misperceptions around China.

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:48.387
But what's really
happening in China is

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.889
this is their moment.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.024
They are now a global power.

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:54.093
They're the second largest
economy in the world,

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.928
will be the largest.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:59.665
- The first time I came to
China, it was in the early 1990s

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:03.002
and I was in Shanghai and I went

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:06.205
to the old Shanghai
Stock Exchange which,

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:08.708
I went in and they said,
"No pictures, no pictures."

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.743
At first I thought it
was for security reasons,

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.112
they didn't want any
pictures in the stock market.

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:15.381
But instead I realized,
they didn't want people

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:19.218
to see how dingy the
Shanghai Stock Exchange was.

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:22.321
And a couple blocks
away, on the Bund I went

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.324
to a meeting with a company
called Shanghai Lujiazui Finance

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:26.792
and Trade Zone
Development Company.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:30.696
They said, "This is what
Pudong is going to look like

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:32.431
"in a very short
period of time."

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.899
There was nothing there.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:37.770
So how you could go from
essentially nothing in Pudong

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.374
to Manhattan in 10 years,
I said, there's no way.

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:44.343
This is impossible,
this would never happen.

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:47.713
(upbeat music)

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:50.316
And I've never been more
wrong about anything

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.084
in the investment
world in my life.

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:54.520
The changes that I saw
from the early '90s,

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.256
over the next 10 years
were extraordinary

00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.359
and the pace of change
has never stopped.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.962
- One of the reasons why things
happen so much faster here

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.563
than what we're
used to at home is

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:06.465
because China is
still in the midst

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:08.200
of what some economists describe

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.703
as they're economic
take-off phase.

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:12.938
This is the process
in which the majority

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:16.409
of the working population
moves from agricultural jobs

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:18.577
to tech and industry and moves

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.579
from the countryside
to the cities.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:24.884
Branden Ahern is a 20-year
Wall Street veteran

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.920
who left the largest
global asset manager

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.156
to help start a business
that makes it easier

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.525
for Americans to
invest in China.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.361
Branden meets regularly
with government regulators,

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.197
banks, insurance
companies and businesses.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:40.332
I don't know anyone who
has a deeper understanding

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:43.202
of China's financial
system than Branden.

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.504
I met with him in Beijing.

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:49.475
- China has urbanized in a
very, very big way in 1980

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:52.678
only 20% of the population
lived in cities.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:56.248
Today it's over 50% and
it'll get up to 75%.

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:58.617
And that's raised hundreds
of millions of people

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:01.587
out of poverty as they
move into these cities,

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:06.592
get access to proper housing,
electricity, sanitation,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.095
air conditioning
but also services

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:11.497
like education and healthcare.

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:14.033
- So you're going from
24% living in cities

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.769
to 56, 58% living in cities.

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:19.739
That's gonna go to 75%
in the next 10 years.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:24.143
So we're gonna see another
130, 150 million people move

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:27.246
to the cities in China over
the next 10 or 12 years.

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.681
They need to be housed.

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:29.949
Who's gonna do it.

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:31.817
They're gonna want to
own their own housing.

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.819
So that's a big growth sector.

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:36.388
- And get this, the big
movement towards cities

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:39.191
and manufacturing that has
taken place over 22 years

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.928
in China, took roughly
120 years in Britain

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:45.064
and 80 years in America.

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:49.602
Here, it's basically all
happened in just one generation.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.204
I know it's probably no
surprise to you to learn

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:55.341
that China has advanced rapidly
over the last few decades

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:57.610
and millions of people
have moved out of poverty

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.412
into the middle class and
even into millionaire status.

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:01.881
But here's the thing.

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:04.683
What Americans don't
realize is this.

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:07.386
China is no longer
simply a nation

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:10.790
that produces cheap
t-shirts and knockoffs.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.659
Wong Hau is the
head of Sigma China.

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:16.162
Sigma is the word's
largest independent

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:19.398
camera lens manufacturer
headquartered in Japan.

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:24.403
- In the past, made in China,
this label means a low value,

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.140
low value added services,
low quality products

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:33.145
and some people just think
China is a assembly factory.

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.315
Because we did not have
any key technologies.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.584
So the only weapon we could use

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:41.320
is the large population,
the low labor costs.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.455
But now things are
quite different now.

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:46.792
So we are moving
forward, with the backup

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:50.196
of government I will say,
sometimes, moving forward,

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:52.364
to the upstream of
the value chain.

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.201
- My view about China
was 15 years out of date.

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:57.870
I expected to come to
China and see bicycles,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.673
to see people just
crowded in the subways.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:01.907
And I saw that, I mean,

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.375
there are many, many
different Chinas.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:07.046
But I also saw a lot of
wealth, I saw a lot passion,

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:10.816
a lot of energy and just
a much more modern society

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.585
than I ever expected.

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:14.386
China eventually became my life.

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:17.189
- James Early is another
American who was quick

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:20.159
to recognize the
opportunity in China today.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:22.394
He's the former director
of research at one

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:25.464
of the world's largest
independent financial
research firms.

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:28.234
- People are missing everything
that's going on here,

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:29.869
how fast things are moving.

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:33.606
- In many ways, the country
has become more sophisticated

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:36.508
and advanced than anything
we're used to in America.

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:39.411
Which is why China is
creating more millionaires

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:41.247
than anywhere else on earth.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:44.016
And why so much
money is flooding in.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.552
Let me show you one
example of what I mean.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.687
One of the first things you
notice when you move about

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:52.024
in China is that almost no
one, including street vendors

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:55.494
and even homeless
beggars use cash anymore.

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:57.630
Regular money, as
most of us know it,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.465
has simply disappeared.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:02.234
- I almost forgot
how fast growing

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:05.037
of the mobile internet
and online payment,

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:08.340
roughly like two or three
years ago I have to, you know,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.810
carry a big wallet
with a lot of changes.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.714
So you have to pay cash or
credit cards whenever you go.

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:18.083
You have to withdraw
cash, you know,

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.185
when you have no cash available,

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.321
you have to find
the ATM machines.

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:25.658
But right now, for here, in
Beijing, not just in Beijing,

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:29.795
even my hometown, I don't
need to carry a wallet at all.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.096
I mean, literally
no cash at all.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.898
- So you don't carry any cash.

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.133
- No, no.
- Every day.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:35.801
- I can live, like
every day, full.

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:37.002
- No credit cards.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:39.471
- No, no, no credit
card, no cash,

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:43.208
even for a full year it's, I
don't need any cash at all.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:46.378
The only thing concerns
me is the battery

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:48.314
of my mobile phone.

00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:49.848
- That's great.
- Yes.

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.417
- So if your battery dies
you don't have any money.

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.419
- Oh yes, yes, that's right.

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:56.455
- Bob van Dijk is
the CEO of Naspers,

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:59.725
one of the biggest technology
investors in the world.

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:02.928
Today, Naspers owns
a huge share of one

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:04.964
of China's biggest tech firms

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.732
and they've helped
build tech companies

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.201
in more than 120 countries.

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:11.704
I met with Bob at his
office in Amsterdam.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:14.440
- Where typically now
you check into a hotel,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.241
you put your credit card down

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:19.912
and you go through
registration, like in China,

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:23.315
you show up with your
phone, they scan a QR code,

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.084
or code that's on your phone

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.286
and they will have your
complete reservation there,

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.687
they'll have your
credit card details

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.422
and your check-in
procedures done.

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:32.358
And interestingly,
it goes as far,

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.493
like if you travel in
parts of China now,

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:37.763
in Beijing for example, you
want to pay with a credit card,

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:38.998
they don't accept
your credit card.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.568
They insist on being
paid by mobile phone.

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.236
The other day I was in Beijing

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:46.505
and I was trying to
buy an ice cream,

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.941
she was a 19-year-old
lovely young woman,

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:51.577
and she couldn't sell me an
ice cream 'cause I had money.

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:55.080
I had renminbi, she
couldn't take money.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.116
You have to do it on your phone.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.185
Everything is on, I wish
I were buying a Mercedes,

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.287
'cause she gave me the
ice cream in the end.

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.622
- Oh really.

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:04.990
- She felt so sorry for
this poor foreigner,

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.426
who couldn't, all
he had was money.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:11.997
Now, there are many things in
China are ahead of the U.S.,

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:15.167
again, I don't like saying
it, Steve, I'm an American,

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.536
my kids are American,
my wife is American,

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:21.206
but I have to face reality
and Tencent, Alibaba,

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.642
I mean, you know the
names as well as I do.

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:26.211
These are not from the guys
in the backyard somewhere,

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:30.983
these are major
gigantic powerhouses,
built on technology.

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:35.421
Liu Xin is business TV
anchor for CGTN in China

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:38.891
and a former China
correspondent for CNBC.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.893
No, I don't see any money
changing hands here,

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.294
I just see these signs.

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.363
- Exactly, so convenient.

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:47.266
- So literally, is there any
money changing hands at all?

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.068
- Very little, I think.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.438
You'd have to be living under
a rock to not have WeChat,

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:56.875
not have Alipay because
the blue is for Alipay

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:59.244
and the green is for WeChat
and there's a constant battle

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:01.480
to see who has more market share

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.382
in the online or offline space.

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.984
Online, because of
Taobao, Alipay definitely

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:10.556
but offline because everyone
uses WeChat as social messaging

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:14.259
and just about everything else
WeChat pay has an advantage.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:16.895
- WeChat, Alipay, Taoboa,

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:19.231
what are these names
that Liu's talking about?

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:22.167
WeChat is the most powerful
social media platform

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:25.370
in China with over
a billion users.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.173
It's like Facebook
but on steroids.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:29.942
You can use it not
only for communication

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.411
with friends and family
but for business dealings,

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:35.347
for setting up doctors
appointments or
dinner reservations,

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:38.050
for paying bills, even
for paying your taxes.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.487
Taobao is the largest
e-commerce website in the world.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:42.955
Bigger than Amazon.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.290
And Alipay is another
mobile payment app,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:49.061
which with WeChat Pay are the
two most popular apps in China

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:51.530
for paying for everything
with your mobile phone.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:54.399
It's amazing, every
time I come to China,

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.502
I see fewer coins and bills.

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:59.838
So I asked Liu Xin about
the virtual disappearance

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:02.040
of all types of physical money.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.642
So how long has this been?

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:05.677
Because I was here
just a few years ago--

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:07.946
- And people still
had coins and notes.

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:11.383
- Yeah, as little as five
years ago, this didn't exist.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.851
- Well--
- I mean, it was--

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.820
- Five years is a
long time in China.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.524
- Right and today, I mean,
do you use cash for anything?

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.225
- Very, very little, yeah.

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.760
- Do you carry cash.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.263
- No, no, I mean, you know,
I've got my Pravda, you see,

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:27.466
I've got my sunglasses
and I've got my phone.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:30.769
And this is why even pickpockets
are becoming unemployed

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.872
in China because they
can't steal phones,

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:35.274
'cause everyone's holding them.

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.342
They can't steal money
anymore, nobody carries money.

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:38.844
- Right.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.146
And that is what is leading
this new cashless society.

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:43.115
You can see it in
action everywhere

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.516
and many times it's paired

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:47.853
with other really
interesting new technologies.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.888
(upbeat music)

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.490
All right, it's
lunchtime in Beijing

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.658
so I want to take you to one

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.693
of the most unique
places you've ever seen.

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.002
So here's what's unique
about this place,

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:06.271
there are no servers
at the tables.

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.607
All of your food travels
down all of these tracks,

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:11.176
goes right in front of you
at the individual table.

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:16.715
Let's get started and
order us a burger.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.517
This is the way it
goes, we'll find,

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:24.723
the American burger there,
check out, continue to payment.

00:20:26.758 --> 00:20:31.763
Select WeChat, hold up
the QR code right here.

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.199
Now we just wait for our burger.

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:44.076
There's my burger.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:47.346
- So I would say a great
example of technology

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.314
that we think is coming

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:52.985
to fruition everywhere
is using mobile phone

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:54.753
to sell used goods.

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:58.490
Think in America, Craigslist
is something everybody knows

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.525
and I think it's
worked well in the past

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:02.427
but it's something
that requires a bit

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.263
of work to sell your item.

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:07.065
Now we've come with
a business like LetGo

00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:08.767
which we're a big investor in,

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.769
to the point where you
basically just need

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:14.706
to point your mobile phone
camera at stuff you don't want

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:18.610
to own anymore and just by
pushing a single button,

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.212
the phone will take a picture,

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.514
it will recognize what
it is you want to sell,

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:24.783
suggest a price for
what you want to sell

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:28.520
and it will immediately
post it on the web

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.389
which gives people
a huge audience

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.725
with absolutely zero effort
to sell their used goods.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:37.229
- This trend, of course,
is proliferating worldwide.

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:40.265
But nowhere is it more
prevalent than in China.

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:42.701
Jonathan Crane is an
American entrepreneur

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:43.935
who got his start bringing

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:46.004
the world's most
popular music acts,

00:21:46.004 --> 00:21:48.073
like the Rolling
Stones, Whitney Houston

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:51.943
and Beyonce to China
roughly 20 years ago.

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:54.346
He explains the
incredible transformation

00:21:54.346 --> 00:21:56.948
he saw take place
in just a few years.

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:59.618
- Doing business in China,
what you immediately see is

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.887
that things move very
quickly over there.

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:05.857
People are very
fast at innovation

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:10.095
and also adoption is
much faster in China

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:11.863
than anywhere else in the world.

00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:14.032
An example is, we had
a ticketing company

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:17.102
and when we started that
ticketing company, we were,

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:21.840
it was probably 2004 and it
was a cash society still.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.310
We then saw 2005, 2006,
people were starting

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.112
to use debit cards, okay.

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:29.114
So instead of having to
have lot of cash around,

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:31.883
you use the debit card
which was convenient.

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:34.052
And then within two
years from there,

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.821
we started doing
mobile ticketing.

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:37.956
So really within
four or five years,

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:41.526
we went from cash delivery
to mobile ticketing.

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:46.531
And the adoption was incredible

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:48.467
that was happening across China.

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:51.837
- This trend will soon
reshape America too.

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:55.540
This is all just a preview
of how it will play out.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.610
Brian Takango has been traveling
across Asia to research

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.114
and invest in local
businesses since 1999.

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:03.882
He's got a remarkable
track record

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.717
of finding future
blue chip companies

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.986
when they are just
still small firms.

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:10.355
I met with Brian
recently in Hong Kong.

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:14.926
- Companies like
Alibaba, like JD.com.

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:18.597
Companies like
BingoBox, for example,

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:23.135
that now have 300 cashless
convenience stores in China

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:25.137
and you just go in,
there's no cashier there,

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.572
you just walk in and
you scan your app

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:31.109
and you get your stuff,
you scan it in this table

00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:34.346
and then you just walk
out with your goods.

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:38.683
And it's all being done through
artificial intelligence,

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:41.920
it's all being done
through the internet

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.689
and these wireless
payment methods.

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:48.059
- I went to one of
these employee-less
stores in Shanghai.

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.928
- All right, Steve, we're
coming out of the subway here

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:52.531
in suburban Shanghai, this
is a middle-class area,

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:54.433
this is not fancy, this
is not cutting edge,

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.134
this is just average China.

00:23:56.134 --> 00:23:57.669
But you can do a lot of things,

00:23:57.669 --> 00:24:00.539
including visit an unmanned
store just with your face.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:04.276
(speaking in foreign language)

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:05.811
(upbeat music)

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:08.180
So inside it's got really
the same stuff you'd find

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.449
in a 7-11, we're the
only people in here,

00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:12.284
you don't need any
person to run this store.

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.286
And yet it's also safer, Steve,

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:16.054
than you'd expect
because everything

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:18.223
in this store is
connected to my face,

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:20.025
which is connected
to my WeChat account,

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.993
which is connected to
my Chinese bank account.

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:23.528
So whatever damage I do here,

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:25.597
all comes back to me
at the end of the day.

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.032
Here you go sir.

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:29.468
I'm just gonna push this
button and we scoot right in.

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:33.972
All we do, we set this guy down.

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:36.241
I'm gonna show my face,

00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:39.511
not proud of that
picture but it'll work.

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:42.147
I'm gonna scan this QR
code with my WeChat app.

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:46.318
And simple as that.

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:48.854
- No employees.

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.722
- No employees, took just a few,

00:24:50.722 --> 00:24:53.291
probably faster checkout
than if we had employees.

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:54.359
Here's your Coke by the way.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:55.727
- Thank you.

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.329
- So that's the future,
right here in China.

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:58.797
- So one of the
things I think is

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.665
really transforming
people's lives is

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:03.101
how people use WeChat in China.

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:06.204
For example when people
decide to meet some friends

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:07.873
for dinner, they typically
would invite them

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:11.376
via WeChat 'cause they're
obviously in their contacts.

00:25:11.376 --> 00:25:14.112
Then they would send, the
reservation would happen

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.780
through WeChat because
the restaurant they want

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.315
to go to is a contact as well

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:21.653
and they have their booking
system integrated in WeChat.

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.488
So then they show
up at the restaurant

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:25.323
at the same time the ordering,

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:28.093
actually the menu of the
restaurant will be embedded

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:30.061
in WeChat and they online order.

00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:31.830
So there will be no
way to take an orders

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.699
but everybody orders
on their mobile phone.

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:37.669
In the end the check also
gets sent to the mobile phone

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.070
and people actually can choose

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.507
to pay with their
integrated tempe options.

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:44.543
So the waiter only
brings the food

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:47.045
and everything else
automatically gets done

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.647
through the WeChat app.

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.050
- These technologies
have even changed

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.152
the way people buy cars.

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:57.889
Get this, you can now reserve
a test car on your phone,

00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:59.491
then pick it up, at
what is essentially

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:03.662
a giant vending machine for
new cars by BMW, Ford and Volvo

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:06.364
and then drive it around
all you want, test it

00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:09.801
for the next three
days for less than $50.

00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:11.169
(upbeat music)

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.971
The thing you need to
understand is that it's not just

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.839
about making payments
on your phone

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:17.042
or getting rid of physical cash.

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:19.578
This development creates
hundreds and hundreds

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:21.413
of new business ideas.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:23.748
This is the future
for us in America

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:28.253
but it's all unfolding right
now in realtime here in China.

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.289
Kevin Lui studied at
Cornell University.

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:35.026
Today he's an equity
strategist at CICC,

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:37.796
the largest investment
bank in China.

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:39.864
Kevin is part of what
is widely considered

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:42.734
to be the best equity
research team in the country.

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.636
And we met up in Beijing.

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:47.105
- Back to 2006 is roughly just

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:50.575
over something
like 1% in China--

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:51.776
- That's unbelievable.

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.545
- With regard to
mobile penetration.

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:58.550
- In 2006, 1% of Chinese
people had mobile internet.

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:00.785
Today it's at least 50%.

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:02.287
- At least, yes, at least.
- At least, yes.

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:07.158
- My life is kind of, very
closely tied with my phone.

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:09.294
(dramatic music)

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:11.630
- Today the amount of
money the Chinese spend

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.700
on e-commerce is 42%
of the world's total.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.070
That means the value of China's
e-commerce transactions is

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.140
now larger than the value of
the e-commerce transactions

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:27.145
from France, Germany, the
UK and the U.S. combined.

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:29.948
This is why the money
is flowing to China

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:32.150
and why more millionaires
are being created here

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.252
than anywhere else in the world.

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:36.855
Everyone, everywhere
uses their mobile phone

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:38.790
to pay for everything.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.560
Food, train tickets, plane
tickets, tolls, clothing,

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.264
fast food, everything
with their mobile phone.

00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:48.299
In fact, on our
most recent trip,

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:50.802
we tried to spend a few hundred
dollars buying souvenirs

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:52.203
at a Shanghai bookstore

00:27:52.203 --> 00:27:54.372
but they no longer
accepted credit cards.

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.107
- What we often look at is,

00:27:56.107 --> 00:28:00.178
what is the size of the
potential user group we have.

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:03.381
And for example the
number of internet users

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:06.217
in China is rapidly
approaching a billion.

00:28:06.217 --> 00:28:07.752
And those are numbers that even

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:09.754
for a huge market like the U.S.,

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:13.158
they dwarf the very
impressive numbers of the U.S.

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:14.859
and I think that in time

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:18.563
as these populations become
connected, wealthier,

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:21.700
presents a fantastic
investment opportunity.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.468
- Things have changed
so fast in China

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:25.770
over the last 30
years from nothing,

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.673
from a very backwards country,

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:32.143
now people are living
lives that a lot of people,

00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:35.246
even in the U.S.,
couldn't even imagine.

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:37.415
- Okay, so from a
cashless society,

00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:40.318
to unmanned stores and
waiterless restaurants,

00:28:40.318 --> 00:28:43.321
to mobile commerce
beyond our imagination,

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:47.325
clearly this is not how most
Americans perceive China.

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:50.195
And these are not stories
you typically see reported

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:51.796
in the mainstream press.

00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:55.467
However this is the
reality in China today.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.469
But hold on, you might
be saying to yourself,

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.871
I thought this was
a communist country.

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:02.407
This doesn't sound
like communism to me.

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.908
Well as Jim Rogers said earlier,

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.244
California and
Massachusetts are probably

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.513
more communist than China.

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:09.781
And the truth is,

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.150
while the Chinese call
themselves communists,

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.787
they are actually among the
best capitalists on earth

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:19.157
and this is part of what's
caused such a radical distortion

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:23.394
between between perception
and reality in China today.

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:25.463
- China isn't a communist
country anymore.

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:29.234
It's not a Marxist
communist regime

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:31.369
like it was under Moa Tse-tung.

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:32.871
It has advanced much more

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:37.208
into what you might call a
form of autocratic capitalism.

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:40.145
It's still a dictatorship,
it's still an autocracy,

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:43.982
it's not a true democracy by
any means, but think about it,

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:47.886
most of the economy is now run
by private sector interests,

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:50.421
by private companies who
are doing their own thing,

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:52.957
investing, doing
what they want to do.

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:56.261
Families can pretty much live
where they choose these days,

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.129
they can get educated
the way they want,

00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:59.664
they can own their own home,

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:01.332
they can invest
in stock markets,

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:03.134
invest in all sorts of products.

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.736
Still a lot of restrictions,

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.305
nowhere near as free as
it is in the West perhaps,

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:10.508
but it's certainly not a
communist country in the way

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:14.746
that Marxism says that all
resources be owned by the state.

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:17.682
That is not the case
in China anymore.

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:19.584
(upbeat music)

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:22.821
- I mean, this is a country
where, since 1978, 1980,

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:25.190
when Deng Xiaoping started
the Open Door Policy,

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.026
a country where GDP
growth has skyrocketed.

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:30.195
Where life expectancy
has skyrocketed.

00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:31.963
Where quality of
life skyrocketed.

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:33.364
Everything has gone up, up, up.

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:35.333
This an economic miracle.

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.168
You know, those are
measurable facts,

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:40.538
in a communist country,
brought about by capitalism.

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:43.708
- It's almost ridiculous to
call China a communism country

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:45.176
because the government
is the biggest capitalist

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.444
in the world.

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:48.379
- I never look at China
as a communist nation.

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:51.049
I don't even ever use the word.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:54.619
You know, China is very
capitalistic, okay.

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:58.256
There's a middle class
forming there, you have hope,

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:02.427
I go back to the word hope
that you can be, you know,

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:05.763
you can be low income
and become a billionaire.

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:08.633
- The truth is the government

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:12.937
in China works very differently
than most Americans think.

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:15.273
In short, they are doing
everything they can

00:31:15.273 --> 00:31:17.208
to foster innovation,

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:20.211
entrepreneurship,
and personal wealth.

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.780
Here's a great example

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.749
of how the Chinese
government has worked

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:27.085
with private businesses
to develop something

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:30.021
that is light years ahead
of what we have in America.

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:34.926
We're getting on the
high-speed train to Shanghai.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:37.528
(upbeat music)

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:55.146
So here we are
experiencing another

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:58.283
of the wonders of Chinese
technology and innovation.

00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.584
We're traveling on
the bullet train

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.786
going 350 kilometers
an hour right now.

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:05.857
That's 250 miles an hour
and one of the common things

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:08.526
I hear from Americans
is, oh well,

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:12.063
China makes inferior goods,
their technology's inferior

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:14.799
but meanwhile everyone's using
their Chinese made iPhone.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:19.470
And I think it's fair
to have American pride,

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.675
which I do myself, but
I think we also need

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:25.843
to be honest about the reality.

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:30.648
I mean, here we are, again
traveling 250 miles an hour,

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.650
using our Chinese technology

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.086
and this is reality
in China today.

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.989
China's high-speed
train system is

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:41.059
a government private
sector collaboration

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.227
that was built in
about 1/3 the time

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:45.596
it could have been
built in America, Europe

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.632
or anywhere else in the world.

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:50.301
Jerry Liu spent
more than a decade

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:53.705
at Morgan Stanley and
Templeton Asset Management.

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:57.408
Today he's the founding
partner of Everpine Capital,

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:59.477
a private equity firm
that helps companies

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:01.679
with cutting edge
technologies take advantage

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.114
of the Chinese markets.

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:04.916
We met with Jerry in Shanghai.

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:08.886
- Once again, if you look at
the high-speed rail network

00:33:08.886 --> 00:33:12.156
in China, I mean,
even, you roll back

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:16.527
by 15 years it
literally did not exist.

00:33:16.527 --> 00:33:19.364
They built everything
from scratch,

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:23.568
from scratch into
the longest, fastest,

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:27.739
most extensive logistics
infrastructure in
the whole world.

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:31.909
- I think the high-speed rail
network is really changed

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:35.380
that country in allowing
people to move, you know,

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.216
in and out of cities
quickly but also be able

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:42.286
to have access to
major cities to work

00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:46.424
but be allowed to live in
second and third tier cities

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:48.026
for more affordable housing.

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:51.162
- If you go to the Hongqiao
Station, in Shanghai,

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:54.766
at 6:30 in the morning, you
will have difficulty getting in.

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.834
It's so packed in and out.

00:33:56.834 --> 00:33:59.404
We're talking about tens
of thousands of people,

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:03.474
traveling into that station,
dismissing themselves

00:34:03.474 --> 00:34:05.610
to everywhere else
in the country,

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.279
starting their business
on Monday morning.

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:11.616
This is how charged
China is today.

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:14.285
You don't see that in
Grand Central Station,

00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:16.187
you don't see that
anywhere else in the world.

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.856
This is how driven China is.

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:23.127
- And it's like, the interstate
highway back in the '50s.

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:24.762
I mean, can you imagine America

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:26.264
without the interstate
highway system.

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.499
Can you imagine
the inland states,

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.301
what would they be right now.

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:33.337
That's what's happening
in China right now

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:35.039
with the roll out of
the infrastructure

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:37.775
from zero expressways
30 years ago,

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:41.179
they now have 116,000
kilometers of expressways.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.682
260,000 kilometers of highways,

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:48.119
from 99 airports they now
have almost 300 airports

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.520
and they're building
dozens more.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.590
- And when you come
to China and see,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.826
you fly into these
brand new airports,

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:59.797
you ride these bullet trains
going 250 miles an hour,

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:02.033
you pay for things
just using your phone,

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.535
you don't carry cash
or even credit cards,

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:07.371
you know, you
really do understand

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:10.141
what's happening
here is different

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:12.243
and it's potentially
only in its infancy

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:13.978
and is only gonna
get even bigger.

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:16.280
- What I think you
have to understand is

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.249
that the leaders
here are not trying

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:21.519
to establish a communist
system where everyone is equal,

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:24.722
this is not at all like
Russia or North Korea.

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.257
Instead, they are trying

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:28.759
to design the most
effective capitalist

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:31.062
and entrepreneurial
system in the world.

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:34.465
And they've proven pretty
darn good at it so far.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:37.034
There's no better example of
the radical transformation

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:39.303
that has taken place here,
with the government's help,

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:41.439
than the amazing place
I showed you earlier,

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:42.907
the city of Shenzhen.

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:48.546
As we told you, in 1979, only
300,000 people lived here.

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:52.416
But Shenzhen became China's
first special economic zone.

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.452
It's gone from a
backwater village

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:57.021
to the most important
tech manufacturing center

00:35:57.021 --> 00:35:59.223
on the planet with a population

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:02.059
that's about the same size as
America's two biggest cities,

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:04.562
L.A. and New York put together.

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:09.567
- It's home to 1,500 research
scientific institutions.

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:13.638
It's not just making
t-shirts and training shoes,

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:16.374
it's some of the highest
tech companies in the world.

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:20.144
Shenzhen is one of the big
reasons why in mid 2018,

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:21.679
for the first time ever,

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:24.949
Chinese companies attracted
more venture capital

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:27.185
than American companies.

00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.787
And although the mainstream
press almost never tells

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:32.924
this story, the money is
clearly flowing to China.

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:35.026
When you take a quick
look at what's happening

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.361
in Shenzhen, it's
easy to see why.

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.597
Today, just this
one Chinese city,

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:41.632
which most Americans
have never even heard of

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:44.835
and basically didn't even
exist 40 years ago is home

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.305
to the world's third
biggest internet company,

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:49.440
it's bigger than
Facebook or Netflix,

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.543
the world's biggest
maker of drones, DJI,

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:55.379
the world's biggest maker
of plug-in electric cars,

00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:58.249
not it's not Tesla, it's BYD

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:01.319
and the world's biggest
telecom equipment company,

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.854
it's Huawei which is
three times bigger

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:05.656
than Sweden's Ericsson.

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:08.826
Many, including The Wall
Street Journal have referred

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:12.330
to Shenzhen as Silicon
Valley of the East.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.665
But in many ways, it's
actually much more advanced

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:16.500
and more sophisticated.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.470
Shenzhen has the world's
largest metro line

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.373
and the world's first
all electric bus fleet.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:27.378
Incredibly, it's 16,000
buses are all electric

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:30.348
and make no noise or pollution.

00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:33.384
This single city has
built more skyscrapers

00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:36.587
in a single year than
the entire United States

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:37.922
during that same time.

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:40.191
And this is the critical point.

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:42.627
Today in Shenzhen,
it's not a place

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:45.463
where businesses simply
copy ideas and products,

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:48.499
it's a new reality where
China is quickly becoming

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:52.003
one of the most innovative
economies on the planet.

00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:56.374
Kaiser Kuo knows both
America and China intimately.

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:57.708
He's a former director

00:37:57.708 --> 00:38:01.379
at Baidu China's largest
internet search engine.

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:04.081
He's also former member
of the Tang Dynasty,

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:05.783
China's first heavy
metal rock band

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.885
which formed 30 years ago.

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.954
Today Kaiser lives in America,

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:13.090
where he helps run a
China focused media firm.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.593
I met up with Kaiser in Beijing.

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:16.761
- Yeah, it was a joke
even among people

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.462
who worked in the industry.

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:20.798
We said C to C which
of course in America,

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:24.201
in English means, you
know, consumer to consumer.

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:26.370
C to C to means copy to China.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.639
There certainly were
a lot of companies

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:32.009
that were simple clones
of American counterparts.

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:33.210
What's really
interesting though,

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.379
is how quickly that
whole merit has shifted.

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:37.715
- Shenzhen, the city
that had blacksmiths

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:39.950
beating charcoal
implements in the streets

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.920
less that 40 years ago
is now the electronics

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.156
and hardware capital
of the world.

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:48.392
It's the most sophisticated
and advanced place on earth

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:51.062
when it comes to building
new electronics and hardware.

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:52.897
While Silicon Valley
has chosen to focus

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:55.599
on software, Shenzhen
has a major advantage

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:58.069
in all of the world's
actually equipment.

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:01.272
That's why Apple has set up
its latest R&amp;D center here.

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.740
IBM is here.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.477
So is Oracle, Cisco and
Videa, Emerson Electronics,

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:10.848
Amazon, Samsung, Microsoft,
Intel, Qualcomm, Tesla,

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:14.185
DuPont, Whirlpool,
Mattel, Phillips Lighting,

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:17.421
Radio Shack, Texas
Instruments, 3M, Broadcom,

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:20.057
BLACK + DECKER, Toshiba, GoPro

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:23.694
and dozens more of the
world's top technology firms.

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:26.364
They've chosen to open
up shop in Shenzhen.

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:29.066
Airbus, the word's
largest plane maker,

00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:32.536
just chose Shenzhen for
an innovation center.

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:34.038
- General Motors
makes more in China

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.573
than it makes in America.

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:38.609
Apple makes more in China
than it makes in America.

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:42.913
Many major American
companies, they know.

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.415
- Right.

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:47.785
- General Motors knows that
China's is gigantic market

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:50.020
for high-quality products.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.722
- The reason these
companies are here is

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:52.957
because they have access

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:55.126
to the world's most
advanced supply chain

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:57.428
for manufacturing
and distribution.

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.797
You can get everything
from raw materials

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:02.600
to computer components
right here in Shenzhen.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.536
- It has become
really the epicenter

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:07.905
for all global
high-tech manufacturing.

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:10.541
It is where the
supply chains sit.

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:13.477
I'm not in Palo Alto,
calling across time zones,

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:15.446
using online translation,

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:17.481
trying to talk through
these things, that you know,

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:19.683
where the back and
forth is taking weeks.

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.152
- Right.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:23.487
- It's an immediacy that
is of tremendous advantage.

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:27.158
And when the United States
stopped manufacturing things,

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:30.494
I think it surrendered a lot
of its advantage in that way.

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:32.530
- Edith Yeung is
a general partner

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.933
of venture capital firm
called 500 Startups.

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:39.837
When asked how to explain
Shenzhen to Americans, she says,

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:42.706
"I would tell them it's a
Silicon Valley for hardware."

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:46.210
She says, "Americans have no
idea what's going on in China.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.045
"There are so many areas

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:51.715
"where China already
exceeds the U.S."

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:53.617
Right now and for the
foreseeable future,

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.885
many of the world's biggest

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.887
and most important
breakthroughs are going

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:58.489
to be coming out of this city

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:01.492
that most American's have
still never heard of.

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.927
One of the most successful

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:07.531
of Shenzhen's recent start-ups
is a company called DJI,

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:10.367
which makes affordable
commercial drones.

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:12.670
The company has a
1,500 person research

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.004
and development team.

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:18.142
Today they have 70% of
the global drone market.

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:19.610
They'll be going public soon

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.712
but Americans have
never heard of them.

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:23.414
All they know is GoPro.

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:25.816
But DJI's drones
are far superior

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:28.052
to GoPro's in almost every way.

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:30.387
The tech site
Gizmodo for example,

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:32.623
recently compared the
two and concluded,

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:36.227
it's practically a
landslide in DJI's favor.

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.128
When you look at
the amazing list

00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:40.564
of new technology
companies in Shenzhen,

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:42.399
it's simply astonishing.

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:43.567
There's a company called

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:46.103
Beijing Genomics
Institute, for example.

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:48.205
The scientific journal, Nature,

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:52.209
called it a DNA superpower
after the company bought

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:54.612
so many genomic
sequencing machines

00:41:54.612 --> 00:41:58.249
that it quickly owned more
than half of the world's total.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:01.151
China used to be known for
being the best supplier

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:04.889
of cheap pharmaceutical
ingredients and knockoff pills

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:07.291
but today China has the
second largest number

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:10.828
of clinical trials involving
biologic treatments

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:12.530
after the United States.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.965
This is why Merck
and Johnson &amp; Johnson

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:17.401
have innovation centers in China

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:19.136
and why companies like Eli Lilly

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.804
and many others are selling

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:24.074
Chinese discovered
drugs overseas.

00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:27.011
But again, almost no one
in America knows this.

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:29.046
It's a story that's
hardly ever reported

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.548
in the mainstream press.

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:34.552
Then there's the
biggest electronic
automaker in the world.

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:37.388
It's not Tesla but a
Chinese company based

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:40.157
in Shenzhen called BYD.

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:42.726
This company has the
biggest battery factory

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:45.129
in the world and
it already sells

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:48.332
more electric cars
every year than Tesla.

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:51.235
BYD also has something
Tesla doesn't,

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:54.505
the backing of the
world's best investor.

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:56.073
Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet

00:42:56.073 --> 00:43:00.277
of Berkshire Hathaway
own nearly 10% of BYD.

00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:03.047
Charlie Munger is one of the
word's leading proponents

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:04.882
of investing in China.

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:06.517
He said in a recent interview,

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:09.486
American investors are
missing out on China.

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:12.389
It just looks too
hard, sitting in Omaha,

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:15.292
but it's where they
should be looking.

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:17.061
And keep in mind,
all these companies

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:21.332
and all these innovations are
all located in just one city.

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:24.401
This is why The Atlantic
magazine recently wrote,

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:27.338
it's now becoming clear
that in many respects,

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:30.641
China has distinct advantages
over Silicon Valley

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:34.211
as it hopes to become the
next nexus for innovation.

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:36.680
- Well, I think the current
perception in America

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.217
of China right now is one
of very archaic perception,

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:42.286
that China is this
massive sweatshop

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:45.155
that's just constantly throwing
cheap goods into America.

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:47.191
But the reality is China is one

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.827
of the most dynamic
economies in the world.

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:52.896
- Okay, but what about all
these impressive numbers.

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:56.000
One of the objections to
China I hear constantly is

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.936
that China's economic
numbers are manipulated.

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:00.504
So I put the question to one

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:03.040
of the most knowledgeable
people on the subject.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.209
- I don't trust any
government numbers,

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:07.645
America, Germany, anybody.

00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:10.247
We've all been caught
lying about our numbers

00:44:10.247 --> 00:44:11.849
and I'm sure that
the Chinese numbers,

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.484
or some of them,
are made up too.

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:16.020
But it doesn't matter
'cause I've been coming here

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.889
for 34 years, you
walk down the street,

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:21.558
you go to a different
city and you say,

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:24.128
my God, last time I was
here five years ago,

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:25.629
none of this was here.

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:28.766
And it all happened, and it
happens very quickly in China,

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.968
partly because it's
a one party state,

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:32.503
therefore they get it done.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:35.939
In America it takes you years
just to build a new church

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:37.908
or a new hospital or
a new school even.

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:41.011
- Jim, as you heard earlier,
is the only man in the world

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.248
who's crossed China on
land three different times.

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:46.984
Twice by motorcycle
and once by car.

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:48.652
And he also has what is probably

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:51.522
the best investing
track record of all time

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:54.124
for the work that he
did during the '70s.

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:58.062
His Quantum Fund
delivered a 4,200% return

00:44:58.062 --> 00:45:01.265
to his investors during a
time when stocks did nothing.

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:04.535
- That does not mean there
won't be problems in China.

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:08.439
America became the greatest
country of the 20th century,

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:11.975
along the way we had 15
depressions, with a d,

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:13.811
we had a horrible civil war,

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:15.813
we had massacres in the streets,

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:19.950
we had very little rule of
law, you could buy and sell,

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.719
you could still buy
and sell congressman,

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:23.454
but in the 19th century
they were cheap,

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:26.623
you could buy four of five
for the price of one now.

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:29.226
America has many
problems along the way.

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:31.195
But we became an
astonishing success,

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:34.264
the most successful country
in the 20th century.

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:36.133
- For me, as we look at China

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:38.168
and this potential opportunity,

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:40.404
I think it's crucial
for us to consider

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:43.073
what we can see
with our own eyes.

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:45.375
Has China grown like crazy?

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.078
And is there more wealth
being created right here,

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:51.181
right now than any
place on earth?

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:52.416
The answers to both

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:55.886
of those questions are
unequivocally, yes.

00:45:55.886 --> 00:46:00.023
Remember, here's what
Shanghai looked like in 1987.

00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:02.459
And here we are cruising
around on a private yacht

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:03.727
in the same spot today.

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:07.264
Here's what Shenzhen
looked like 30 years ago,

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:10.200
and here's what Shenzhen
looks like today.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:14.938
- This is really the greatest
wealth creation event

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:17.741
in the history of
the world in my view.

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.877
If you look at the scale we see,

00:46:19.877 --> 00:46:23.247
this is 1.4 maybe even
1.5 billion people

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:26.617
because of under
counting who are going

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:30.721
from literally third-world
conditions in 1978

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:33.791
when Deng Xiaoping began
the Open Door Policy

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:37.227
to now you've got this mix
of the third world still,

00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:39.396
if you go to rural China,
definitely in the third world,

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:41.965
second world and
increasingly first world,

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:43.300
more and more and more.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.768
And that's why
everybody's trying to come

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:47.004
to the Chinese cities,
that's why we're in

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:49.306
one of the fanciest hotels
I've ever stayed at,

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.508
that's why, you know, you
look at when you see Bentleys

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:54.411
in the parking lot here,
Ferraris, Porsches,

00:46:54.411 --> 00:46:57.414
that's real wealth and
it's growing day by day.

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.483
- Sure, the government
has a heavy hand

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.018
in directing this economy,

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:03.954
but one amazing
thing is very clear.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.522
The Chinese government can get

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:09.026
enormous initiatives completed
in a fraction of the time

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:12.162
it would take to accomplish
these anywhere else.

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:14.364
I showed you the most
amazing bullet train system

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.666
in the world already.

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.401
But that's just the beginning.

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.570
Right now the Chinese
government is forcing

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.373
the big telecom companies
to spend $180 billion

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:26.109
over seven years to
build the infrastructure

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:29.146
for the world's largest
5G mobile network.

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:32.015
Meanwhile in America,
50 different states are

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:34.351
all trying to plot
their own course.

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.819
Do you really want
to bet against China

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.888
with this type of
infrastructure initiative?

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.356
I sure don't.

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:42.960
- Most of the rural areas,
they've skipped the landlines.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.928
Now they, and my suspicion is

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:46.797
that they're gonna
make the next leap

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:49.867
into the 5G faster than
anywhere else in the world.

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.935
- Another example, in Beijing,

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:55.505
I met with the man who designed
Beijing's tallest building

00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:58.742
and helped design an area
called Beijing Fun Town.

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:02.112
This is an ultramodern
environmentally friendly area

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:05.048
where nearly all of the
businesses are venture capital,

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:07.751
hedge funds, private
banks, asset managers,

00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.953
and other types of
investment funds.

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:13.857
This is what's possible here
in this communist country.

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:17.094
- China is an example of
a country that has gone

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:20.197
from the Stone Ages
into the 21st century

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:22.366
over the space of 30 years.

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:27.070
So it's really a fundamental
transformation of a society

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:30.374
and an economy, the likes
of which I've never seen.

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:33.510
I don't think anybody's seen
this kind of transformation

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.247
in this kind of time frame,
anywhere in the world.

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:40.417
Not least a country
with 1.3 billion people.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.185
- The way I look at it is, yes,

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:44.888
China has a thousand
challenges on its hands.

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:47.691
But so does nearly ever
other country in the world.

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:50.160
And there can be
absolutely no denying

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.863
that the opportunities
in China are far bigger

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.798
than anywhere else on earth.

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.199
Folks who are
getting in early on

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:58.735
these trends are
making a fortune.

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:01.805
You might be familiar with
FANG, the acronym in the U.S.

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:05.242
for Facebook, Amazon,
Apple, Netflix and Google.

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.444
Well in China, there's
something similar.

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:11.882
- BAT is an acronym that stands
for Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent.

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:15.352
These are three major
technology companies in China.

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:18.255
Baidu search company, I think
a lot of people draw analogies

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:19.823
to Google because, of course,

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.158
like Google in
the United States,

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:24.161
it's the dominant search
engine here in China.

00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:26.897
Similar business
model and everything.

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:30.167
Alibaba is a massive
e-commerce company.

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:32.202
It really dominates e-commerce.

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:35.072
Tencent is a company that
doesn't have a close analogy

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.306
in the United States.

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:38.308
It actually draws
most of its revenue

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:39.943
from gaming and
things like that,

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:42.379
but it's most famous
product is a sort

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:45.182
of all in one
communications platform,

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:48.385
kind of a Swiss Army knife
of an app called WeChat.

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.487
And it's sort of
WhatsApp, Facebook,

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.990
all these things sort
of rolled all into one.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.158
You can pretty much do
anything you need to do

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:58.562
from buying things,
from hailing taxis.

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:01.498
- They have WeChat account not
because they're required to,

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:03.934
but because it's just so
convenient for them now.

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:06.103
I mean, their entire
lives are online.

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:08.872
They have their bank
statements there,

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:12.175
they can send money to relatives
halfway across the country

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:16.246
in just a few seconds, I mean,
it's a huge benefit to them,

00:50:16.246 --> 00:50:17.981
that's why they're all online.

00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:19.549
- We have the
incredible opportunity

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:22.519
to have meetings in two
of Tencent's locations.

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:25.822
First in Beijing and
then also in Shenzhen,

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:28.392
their amazing new headquarters.

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:30.861
Well that was amazing,
we just left Tencent,

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.295
and we weren't allowed
to bring you inside

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:33.897
because of high
security and everything

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:35.165
but really James and I got

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.667
to see the future
right here at Tencent.

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.403
- Yeah, just the place is
tighter than Fort Knox,

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:41.505
they've got high tech,
cool stuff but the thing,

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.673
Steve, that you just said
that struck me a minute ago is

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:45.142
that this could
have been Google,

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.476
this could have been
in Silicon Valley.

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:49.579
We walked in, we were
greeted by an AI robot,

00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:52.349
we have AI facial recognition
to get into the elevators,

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:55.318
that's also in use by the
Chinese government they said,

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.020
and these are people
working 15 hours a day.

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.288
- Yeah, they want
you to stay there,

00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.756
so their working 15 hours a day.

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:00.991
But just like Google, you know,

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:02.926
James and I played ping pong,

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:05.195
James also climbed the
climbing wall inside there.

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:07.130
So we weren't working
hard inside there

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:08.398
but everyone else was.

00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:09.232
- We were the only
ones playing actually,

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:10.667
yeah, but it was fun.

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:13.270
- I told you about how
tech companies like Tencent

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:18.075
and Baidu are up as much
as 50,000% since 2004.

00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:20.544
But it's not just the tech
firms that are soaring.

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:23.380
Look at some of these real
estate and construction firms

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.650
that are making people
simply extraordinary gains.

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:28.885
China Fortune Land
Developments soared more

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:32.722
than 8,000% beginning in 2003.

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.724
China Overseas
Land and Investment

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:39.529
also soared roughly 8,000%
beginning in the year 2000.

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:41.364
China Resources Land soared more

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:45.669
than 6,500% beginning
in the year 2000.

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:50.640
Country Garden Holdings soared
1,400% beginning in 2008.

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:54.077
The list goes on and on and on.

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:56.179
- People now talk about
a new crop of companies

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:58.715
that are coming
up, many of them,

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.784
not all of them yet listed.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:03.887
TMD is the new acronym that
you'll be hearing a lot about.

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:08.725
Toutiao which is an AI driven
news site which is massive.

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:10.794
The actual company
is called ByteDance

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:14.030
but they're flagship
product is Toutiao.

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.999
Meituan is another one

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:18.635
which is a sort of
online services platform.

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:22.606
O2O as it's called in Chinese,

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:26.209
where you can do anything from
book seats in restaurants,

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:29.479
order takeout or buy
movie theater tickets

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:33.016
or get discounts on things,
group buying, it's enormous.

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:35.085
And finally, D, stands
for Didi Chuxing

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:38.855
which is like the Uber
of China but on steroids.

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:40.023
- Yeah.

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:42.159
Kaiser mentioned a
business called Meituan.

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:45.128
It's the biggest food delivery
platform in the world.

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:47.330
You can order from
thousands of restaurants,

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.367
on your phone and have food
delivered to your door.

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:53.036
Get this, Meituan is
worth more than twice

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:55.005
its American counterparts, Yelp,

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:57.774
Groupon and Grubhub combined.

00:52:57.774 --> 00:53:00.277
- China has really
come to the stage.

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:04.481
It's technology and product
hunger is really unparalleled.

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:07.918
It's not seen
anytime anywhere else

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.886
in the world and in history.

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:14.357
So, we're talking about really
more than a billion people,

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.126
upgrading their lifestyle,

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:21.097
pretty much catching up
to U.S. and European style

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:22.832
but in a very dramatic manner.

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:26.736
- China has seen technology
develop very much

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:30.040
in lockstep with its really
rapid environmental growth.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.676
There's a kind of
faith in the ability

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:35.812
of technology to
deliver better lives.

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:37.781
Compare that to the
United States right now

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:40.784
where there's a lot of
anxiety about technology.

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:43.687
- This will be a rising economy.

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:48.692
I'm not seeing the market
degrading itself anytime soon.

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:52.062
I think it's still
going full steam ahead.

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:55.265
China is the second
largest economy today

00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:57.934
and I think it will
probably keep growing

00:53:57.934 --> 00:54:02.839
and become the biggest
consumer market in the world.

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:06.109
It will be there with
or without your capital.

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.978
So it's really your call.

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.212
(dramatic music)

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:10.614
- There's a saying in
the financial world

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:13.016
that money flows to
where it's treated best.

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:15.318
And right now the
best place to build

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:18.822
and grow wealth is
unquestionably in China.

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:21.491
Which is why the smart
money is moving here.

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:23.293
The money being made here is

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:26.396
like nothing we have ever
seen in human history.

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.466
What's crazy to
me is that despite

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.301
all the evidence I've shown you,

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:33.703
the mainstream media
in America still loves

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:35.171
to hate on China.

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:37.207
Look at some of these
recent book covers.

00:54:38.475 --> 00:54:39.309
(dramatic music)

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.977
But here's the truth.

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:43.680
Already the best
investors from America,

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.049
including our most famous
and successful investor,

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.485
Warren Buffet, and his business
partner Charlie Munger,

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:50.754
are here in a big way.

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.856
So are Bill and Melinda Gates,

00:54:52.856 --> 00:54:54.958
the Yale and Harvard
pension funds,

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:57.327
Goldman Sachs, Bill Gross.

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:00.497
And by the way, speaking of
millionaires and billionaires,

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:03.333
according to the BBC
and the latest figures,

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:07.837
China is producing two new
billionaires every week.

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:09.773
That's twice as
many as were created

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.975
in America over the
same period of time.

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.911
And get this, the
country recently created

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:18.715
a million new millionaires
in a single year.

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:22.052
That's more millionaires
in a single year

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:23.586
than the total that exists

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:26.056
in the wealthy nation
of Switzerland.

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:28.825
But it's not just individuals
making huge money.

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:32.495
There are many success stories
for small businesses too.

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:35.932
- So I give you one
example we invested in,

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:38.702
it's a French company,
it's called EyeTechCare.

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:41.971
So this is a company, with
a cutting edge technology

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:46.576
that could cure glaucoma using
the ultrasonic technology.

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:47.777
It's the only
company in the world

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:48.878
that is capable of doing that.

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:50.814
But it was a local company,

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:53.550
it was a French
company based in Lyon.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.286
Today we took this company
to the China market

00:55:56.286 --> 00:56:00.790
and it's already in more
than 30 cities in China

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.760
and it's doing
business really well.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.295
- Jerry told us the
money they're making

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:07.430
in some of these individual
Chinese cities is

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:10.367
as much as they were
making in all of France.

00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:13.169
And there are others making
extraordinary gains as well.

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:15.638
America's number one
venture capital firm,

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:19.175
Sequoia Capital, has even
set up a division in China.

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:22.579
They recently made
more than 1,000% return

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:26.182
worth millions of dollars
on one of their investments.

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.251
And the most
profitable investment

00:56:28.251 --> 00:56:30.453
in the history of the
world was made here.

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:34.391
A 500,000% gain in
roughly 17 years.

00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:37.260
Bloomberg called it
the deal of the century

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.828
and for good reason.

00:56:38.828 --> 00:56:42.031
That type of gain turns
every $200 invested

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:43.333
into more than $1 million.

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.003
That investment was made
by a man named Koos Bekker

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:50.206
and his company, an investment
firm called Naspers.

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:53.209
What they did was
invest in Tencent,

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:56.446
even though most Americans
had never heard of it.

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:58.915
Again, the smart money
is moving to China,

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:00.750
simply because this
is the best place

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.853
to turn a small investment
into a sizable fortune

00:57:03.853 --> 00:57:05.355
in the years to come.

00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:07.957
- And I left the U.S. for
China, where I am right now,

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:11.461
because frankly, in all
my life I had never seen

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:14.798
such wealth creation
happening in the size

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:17.934
and with the speed that
is happening right here,

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.969
right now in China.

00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:22.739
- But I moved to Asia
because of China,

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:24.707
I want my children to
grow up speaking Mandarin,

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:27.777
and in their lifetime
China will be

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.546
the most important country.

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:31.948
- As an American investor,
I think this is the,

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:34.150
in my personal opinion,
I think this is once

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:37.220
in a many years
opportunity to dive in.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.355
- You've seen the
incredible new technologies

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:41.090
and innovations
coming out of China

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.693
that almost no one in
America knows about yet.

00:57:43.693 --> 00:57:46.196
I've told you about the
huge economic tailwind

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:49.799
of this market, how another
300 million people migrating

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:52.469
to cities and moving into
the middle class will create

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:55.004
the biggest consumer
market in history.

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:56.873
And I've told you
about how so much

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:59.609
of the smart money
is already in China.

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.578
But there's a huge
part of this story

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.379
that I haven't
even mentioned yet,

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:05.181
in fact it's what
got me so interested

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:06.850
in China just a few years ago

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.319
and might be the
most important part

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:11.387
of this incredible story.

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.655
(gentle music)

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:15.325
In short, there are two
enormous piles of money,

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:18.061
I'm talking over a
trillion total dollars

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:21.231
that are about to get pushed
into the Chinese stock market.

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:26.236
This new money is absolutely
100% coming to Chinese stocks.

00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:28.705
And nothing like this
has ever happened before

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:31.574
in the history of the financial
markets, not on this scale.

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:32.775
Here's the deal.

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:35.144
A group called
MSCI, which stands

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:37.747
for Morgan Stanley
Capital International,

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.549
controls where huge portion

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:41.684
of international
money is invested.

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:43.186
And for the first time ever,

00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:47.290
MSCI is forcing hundreds
of billions of dollars

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.993
from the world's biggest
mutual funds, pensions

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:51.194
and insurance companies

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:54.130
to be invested in
local Chinese stocks.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:57.834
- There's gonna be a
sea change around China,

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.969
because it's the
largest asset managers,

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.938
it's the largest
pension plans globally,

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:04.674
they're gonna be coming
here for the very first time

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:08.645
because they have
to own these stocks,

00:59:08.645 --> 00:59:10.980
these bonds that we hold today.

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:14.183
- This process started
in June of 2018,

00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:15.852
the next waves of
money are scheduled

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.387
to go into Chinese stocks

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:21.357
in May and August of 2019 with
even bigger moves after that.

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:25.461
We're talking hundreds of
billions of dollars in total.

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:27.196
Never in my career
have I seen a way

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:29.032
to legally front run many

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.967
of the worlds biggest
money managers.

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:32.869
But that's what you can do today

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:35.338
by buying the exact same
stocks they're going

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:37.173
to be soon forced to own.

00:59:37.173 --> 00:59:39.242
This development has
been barely been reported

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.543
in the mainstream press.

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:42.011
But the few folks

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:44.180
who have picked up on it
understand the consequences.

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:48.985
As the BBC reported, this is
definitely a game changer.

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:50.486
But this secret boost

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:53.389
to the Chinese stock market
won't remain a secret forever.

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:55.825
Once these big American
institutions have

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:57.327
their money invested there,

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.062
you will begin to
hear them talking

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.330
about the great new companies

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.198
in China every chance they get.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.701
So that's one big pile of money

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.669
that will soon be
forced into China.

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:10.607
The second big pile coming
here could even be bigger.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.976
The Chinese government recently
announced they're going

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:16.613
to pour enormous sums,
as much as $1 trillion

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.849
in the years to come, into
their public pension funds

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:22.852
to make sure there's
enough money for retirees.

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.921
And as the Financial
Times reported,

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:26.923
this will send a flood of cash

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:29.158
into domestic Chinese equities.

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.960
- We're about to see, over
the next two to three,

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.062
four to five, and
especially 10 years,

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:35.331
a new era in Chinese investing.

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.500
And it's gonna be powerful.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.737
- In total, these two new
big piles of money going

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:43.106
into the Chinese stock
market will total

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:46.509
at least $1 trillion and
what's incredible is,

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.978
you can get your
money there first.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.180
I'm sure I don't have to
tell you what's gonna happen

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.883
when you essentially double
the pile of money chasing

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:56.686
the same big local
Chinese stocks.

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:59.489
The value of these businesses
in the market will have

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:04.027
only one way to go in the
longterm and that's up, up, up.

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.895
Again, almost no one

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:09.232
in the mainstream press is
reporting on this story.

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:11.367
But that's great
news for you and me.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:14.437
I've simply never seen
a bigger difference

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.973
between perception and reality

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:19.809
than what we see in China today.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:22.045
It's both the biggest
in dollar terms

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:25.848
but also just in
those emotional terms,

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:29.986
I come home from China and I
try to explain to Americans,

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:33.956
to my wife, to my mother-in-law
what I've experienced

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:36.893
and when I explain the
reality of what's going on

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.928
on the ground, they
still are not willing

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:43.833
to change their extreme
perception of what they think.

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:48.404
My wife and kids never
really understood China

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:50.840
until I took them
there in person.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.543
And that's the whole
reason I created this film,

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:57.113
so you could hopefully
understand this
amazing opportunity

01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:59.782
without having to
go there in person.

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.584
(upbeat music)

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:04.320
Look, while it's going
to get harder and harder

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.023
to make money in America,
in the years to come,

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:09.592
the money that will be
made in China is going

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:13.096
to dwarf everything
else on the planet.

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:15.932
I think we'll see a time
in the next few years

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:19.268
where the entire Chinese
stock market at least doubles

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:22.472
in value in as
little as 18 months.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.707
And that's just
in the short term.

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.142
Over the long term,

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:30.213
this entire market is
going to soar 500% or more.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.315
And the best companies
in China are going

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:35.318
to return thousands
of percent gains.

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:39.122
Investing in China's best
businesses today is very much

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:42.658
like investing in
Microsoft, Apple, Amazon

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:46.562
and Google before they
became household names.

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:50.399
These are truly life-changing
investment opportunities

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:53.469
which are extraordinarily
cheap to purchase today,

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.404
especially compared
to similar investments

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:56.706
in the United States.

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:59.108
- The U.S. is making
all-time highs.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:01.711
Chinese market is down 60%.

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:04.247
Now, I don't know if
they told you at school,

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:07.016
but you're supposed to
buy low and sell high.

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:08.184
- Right, right.

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:10.987
- So for me, something
that's down 60%,

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.789
might be more attractive

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.158
than something making
all-time highs.

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.926
(dramatic music)

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:20.263
- Investing in China is an
incredible deal right now.

01:03:20.263 --> 01:03:22.198
Very few investors
are paying attention

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:24.000
plus the growth potential

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.403
in China is radically
bigger and China has some

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:30.239
of the most innovative
companies in the world.

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:33.409
Also, more than $1
trillion will be forced

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:35.878
into Chinese stocks
in the next few years

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:38.080
because of the MSCI decision

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.917
and the national
pension catch-ups.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:43.653
Anyone of these factors
would be reason enough

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:48.057
to invest a significant sum
in China in the years to come.

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:51.127
But when you add all
these factors together,

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:55.198
it's a perfect storm
for making new money.

01:03:55.198 --> 01:03:56.833
- I am extremely bullish

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.402
on where China is
going to be going.

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:01.137
I think there all
right a lot of things,

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:04.373
a lot of very strong
tailwinds that we still see.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.275
- Warren Buffet
is the most famous

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.244
and one of the most
successful investors

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:10.847
in America over
the past 60 years.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.915
One of my favorite
Buffet quotes is

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:15.751
from his 1996 shareholder letter

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:17.720
because it summarizes
the opportunity

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.456
before us in China
today, perfectly.

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:24.794
Buffet says, your goal as
an investor should simply be

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.363
to purchase at a rational price,

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:30.933
a part interest in an easily
understandable business

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.902
who's earnings are
virtually certain

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:37.173
to be materially higher, five,
10 and 20 years from now.

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:40.409
Over time, you will find
only a few companies

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:42.011
that meet these standards.

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.247
So when you see
one that qualifies,

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.250
you should buy a
meaningful amount of stock.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.151
I never thought we'd
see a moment like this

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:51.621
in my entire career,
we have a moment

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:54.891
where China is the world's
second largest economy

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.559
and it's battling with Japan

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.662
to be the world's second
largest stock market,

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:04.166
but meanwhile, nobody is
invested in Chinese stocks.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.668
And when I say nobody,

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.871
I mean American institutional
investors, global investors,

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:11.707
even the local Chinese
are not really invested

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.743
in Chinese stocks.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.778
- I think China has huge
investment potential.

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:18.080
- As I tell my
customers all the time,

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.051
there are always plenty of
reasons not to invest somewhere.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:25.855
Yes, there are many reasons
not to invest in China today.

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:28.925
But think about this,
there were many reasons not

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:32.194
to invest in U.S.
stocks back in 2009,

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.864
in fact back then the reasons
were way more compelling

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:38.100
than they are to not
invest in China today.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.536
But the U.S. market
tripled back then

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:43.673
while most people simply
sat on the sidelines.

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:45.574
The same thing is
going to happen

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:47.677
over the next few
years with China.

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.045
There are plenty of reasons not

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:52.515
to invest but the
big picture is clear.

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:56.419
- China has lifted 600
million people out of poverty

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:58.321
over the last 20 years or so

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:01.123
and they've been brought
into middle income status.

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.525
And in the next 20 years,

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:05.194
China will become a
high-income status country.

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:09.799
So that transformation is
probably the most rapid

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:13.002
and significant I think,
in humankind ever.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.570
You've seen other
little countries

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.573
when they get an oil
rush, the Middle East,

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:20.343
you'll get oil comes through
and oil prices jump up

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.844
and suddenly they're
very wealthy.

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:24.580
But it's 10, 20 million people.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:28.084
This is over a billion people
and it's not stopping here.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.486
There's still a long way to go.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.722
- You know how people today
are kicking themselves

01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:36.359
for missing out on Amazon,
Google, Facebook and more?

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.860
Well in five years or so,

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.929
most of those same people
are gonna look back

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:42.498
and say, man, how
could I have not seen

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.300
this huge opportunity in China

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.769
in the fastest growing
economy in the world

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.204
with many of the best

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.639
and fastest growing
businesses on the planet.

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.174
- At this point, Steve,

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:55.144
I've essentially gone all
in on China in my career.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.879
I've invested not just my money,

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.948
but my entire career
in this country.

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.384
- I think you'd be
crazy not to participate

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:03.252
in it even in a small way.

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:05.087
You don't need to
jump in boots and all,

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:08.157
but I think this
is a growth story

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:11.594
that's gonna run for at
least another 10 or 20 years.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.362
- Imagine if you had
not invested in the U.S.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:16.899
in the last 30 years, what
would you have missed out on.

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:19.001
That's exactly what
you will miss out

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.970
if you don't invest
in China today.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.172
(dramatic music)

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.808
- I hope you enjoyed this
journey through China

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:28.244
and a look at the
incredible opportunities

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:29.545
that it presents us today.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.282
You know, I'm sure that some
people are gonna be very angry

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:35.918
at me for making this film
and encouraging people

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:37.420
to learn more about China

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.222
and to ultimately take an
investment stake there too.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:43.926
In fact, I'm sure some people
will call me un-American.

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:45.628
But I hope that you're
open-minded enough

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:47.930
to see what's really going on.

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:52.334
The truth is, China and America
are the future together.

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.703
It's not going to be
and it doesn't have

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:57.606
to just be just
one or the other.

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.442
And the simple reality is,

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:02.111
many places in China
are more advanced

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:05.548
and more sophisticated
than anyplace in America.

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:07.683
But many of America's
biggest breakthroughs

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.919
in trends of tomorrow,
are taking place

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.622
in China right before
out eyes, today.

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.591
Plus China's economy is likely

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:17.993
to double in size
in the years to come

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:21.964
and that's not likely gonna
happen anytime soon in America.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:24.266
Yes, there are a
thousand reasons

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:26.836
not to invest in China today,

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:30.372
but I think anyone who takes
an unbiased look will see

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.576
that the positives far
outweigh the negatives.

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:36.946
There's no doubt in my
mind, the massive difference

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:40.649
between perception and reality
in China today has created

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:45.287
the greatest money-making
opportunity of our lifetimes.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:48.724
But this story won't
remain a secret for long.

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.392
I hope you take advantage of it

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.394
before the rest of
the world catches on.
