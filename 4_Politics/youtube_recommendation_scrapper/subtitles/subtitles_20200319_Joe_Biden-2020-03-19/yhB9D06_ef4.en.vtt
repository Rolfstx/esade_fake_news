00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.801
 - Trevor Noah here.

00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:02.069
Right now, we don't know

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:03.503
 when we're gonna go
 back to the studio.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.005
 We don't know if we're
 gonna go back to the studio.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.308
And I don't think any of
you know any different.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.811
Coronavirus has changed
everybody's lives.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.980
  And so, what we've decided

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.816
 is to try and make The
 Daily Show from homes.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.651
 Not just my home,
 but everyone's home,

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.820
 so the producers, the writers,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.722
  the directors, the
  graphic producers.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.490
 We're all just
 gonna chill at home

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.793
 and use the technology we
 have to try and make a show.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.762
 So, I know a lot of
 people have said,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.764
 "Hey, we still wanna
 watch The Daily show,

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.132
 "we still wanna be informed,

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.567
 "we still wanna
 catch up on the news

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.702
"without having to
watch 24 hours of CNN,"

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.371
and I don't blame you for that.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.840
 So, that's what
 we're gonna be doing.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.541
 So, let's get into it.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.778
 Today we're gonna be chatting
 about coronavirus, obviously.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.046
 It would be weird if was like,

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.281
 "Today, we're gonna
 be chatting about

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.516
 "infrastructural
 development in ... "

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.918
 No.

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.185
 So, we're gonna be
 chatting about coronavirus.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.420
 We're gonna be talking about

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.355
the U.S. border with
Canada being shut down.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.858
  We're gonna talk about NBA
  players getting tested.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:58.825
We're gonna chat
about how people

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.594
 need to stop going to the ER,

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:03.730
because you're actually
hurting everybody who needs it.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.332
So, let's get into that and more

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:09.036
 in our very first Daily
 Show Social Distancing Sh--

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:09.970
 No.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.471
 Daily Social Distancing Show.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:12.472
  That's it.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.042
The Daily Social
Distancing Show.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.444
(dynamic music)

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.446
 - [Announcer] From Trevor's
 couch in New York City

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.115
to your couch
somewhere in the world,

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.519
 this is The Daily
 Social Distancing
 Show with Trevor Noah.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.222
 - All right, y'all.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.724
Let's kick it off with
the big news of the day.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:34.394
 The coronavirus has
 officially surpassed 200,000

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:38.799
  confirmed cases worldwide,
  which is pretty insane,

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.600
 'cause right now,
 that means corona's

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.503
running around the world
like those penguins

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.606
 at the aquarium, doing
 whatever it wants.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.309
It's actually funny
when you think about it.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.412
 Like, you know when you watch
 that video of the penguins?

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.848
 We always think that, if
 humans were off the planet,

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.383
 then there would be no zoos.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.885
 But then, when I watch that
 video, it made me realize

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.488
animals would make
zoos for other animals.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:02.556
Like the penguins would be like,

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:03.790
 "And this is the polar bear.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.992
 "He used to hunt us.

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.227
  "How things have changed."

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:10.397
Anyway, I'm not telling
you the news of corona

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:12.432
  surpassing 200,000
  to make you sad.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.800
  All right?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.735
I'm just keeping you up-to-date
with what's happening.

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.403
  We all gotta be informed.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.839
 Now, just because coronavirus
 cases are going up

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.576
 in the world, please, that
 shouldn't make you more sad,

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:24.411
 because there is a lot
 of encouraging news

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.213
 coming out from
 all over the world.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.248
  For instance, just
  today, just today

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.617
 there was a story that
 came out of Italy,

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.120
 where a small town
 of about 3,000 people

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.622
tested everyone in the
town, and then they just

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.058
 kept track of everyone
 who had coronavirus

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:39.626
 and who was giving it to who,

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:42.629
  and they got the cases of
  coronavirus down to zero.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.500
 So, it shows you that's
 basically what we need to do.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.734
  All right?

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.369
We need to test as many
people as possible.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.238
 And I know, if you live in New
 York, you're probably like,

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.341
 "Yeah, but, Trevor, that town
 only had 3,000 people in it.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.209
  "That's how many
  roommates I have."

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.211
But still, it shows that the key

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.615
to stopping
coronavirus is testing.

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:03.417
  What's scary about
  testing, though,

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.552
  is that the cases
  are gonna go up,

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.054
'cause the more people we test,

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:09.489
  we're gonna discover more
  people have coronavirus.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.792
 But at least we'll know how
 many people have coronavirus.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.093
  You know?

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.694
  It's like today,
  we just found out

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.631
that four Brooklyn Nets
players, NBA players,

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.966
have coronavirus,
including Kevin Durant.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.201
 Yeah.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.669
  So, now the Nets
  have coronavirus,

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.571
 the Jazz have coronavirus,
 the Pistons have coronavirus.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.441
 It's going around to
 all of the NBA teams,

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:29.543
except the Knicks,
because not even corona

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:31.278
  wants to be on the Knicks.

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.680
  Now, the White House keeps
  trying to reassure people

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.182
 that more tests are coming,

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.384
  but every time Trump tries
  to calm the nation down,

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.487
 I feel like he does
 the exact opposite.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.589
 - We are all in this together,

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.891
and we'll come through together.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.393
  It's the invisible enemy.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.463
  But we're going to defeat
  the invisible enemy.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.698
 - [Reporter] Your credibility
 ratings are very low.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.200
 There's a recent NPR poll--

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.068
 - Who are you asking
 that question?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.336
 - I'm asking--

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.871
 - 'Cause I see that
 they're very high.

00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:00.073
  - Why do you keep calling
  this the Chinese virus?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.608
 Why do you keep using this?

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:02.976
 All of people say it's racist.
 - 'Cause it comes from China.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.344
It's not racist at all.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.645
No, not at all.

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.614
 It comes from China.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.149
 That's why.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.584
  - There are some, at least
  one, White House official

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.253
 who use the term "kung
 flu," referring to the fact

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.921
  that this virus
  started in China.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.223
My question is,

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:16.890
  do you think that's wrong?
  - Kung flu?

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.125
 - Kung flu.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.460
And do you think using
the term Chinese virus,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.262
  that puts Asian
  Americans at risk,

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:23.530
 that people might target them?
 - No, not at all.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.464
No, not at all.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:25.565
  I think they probably ...

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.602
  would agree with it 100%.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.804
  - You know Trump
  is the only person

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:32.672
 who could hold a press
 conference about a pandemic

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.242
 and then turn it into
 a fight about racism.

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:36.843
 Who does that?

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.278
 Like, who does that?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.113
 The guy comes out there like,
 "Let's stay calm, folks.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.715
 "So calm, everybody."

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:42.916
 And then, five minutes
 later, he's like,

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:45.852
"Kung flu is a term of respect.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:49.790
  "Ask any Asian. (speaking
  in foreign language)

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.059
 "Kung flu." (speaking
 in foreign language)

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.894
 Focus.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.364
  This is where you
  need presidential.

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.899
This is one of those
moments where I wish ...

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.268
 I wish Obama could
 come back, you know?

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.435
 I wish Barack Obama could--

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.703
  Not as president.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.572
 I'm not trying to mess
 with the Constitution.

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:07.307
 I'm just saying they
 should hire Obama

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.442
  to handle press briefings.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:10.944
  You know?

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:12.279
  'Cause whether you agree
  with his policies or not,

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.348
you have to admit Barack
Obama did his thing.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.184
 He knew how to calm
 everybody down.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.886
He'd just come out and be like,

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.154
 "All right, everybody.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.956
 "This is what's gonna happen.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:25.158
"We're gonna get the ...

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.226
  "testing.

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.327
 "All the kits.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.763
"We're gonna isolate the virus.

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.198
 "We're gonna beat this thing.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.600
"We're gonna isolate the virus,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.335
"and we're gonna
beat this thing.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.239
  "In the meantime, if you
  want something comforting

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.440
  "to binge at home.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.475
"A lot of people
are watching TV.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.277
"If you want to watch something,

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:48.348
 "you can watch the first
 eight years of my presidency.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.717
 "That's a rerun
 that never gets old.

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.619
"The best part is in season two,

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:54.821
 "when I go after Bin Laden.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.490
  "Spoiler alert: he
  doesn't make it."

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:00.694
 Actually, I feel like Obama

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.829
  takes so long to
  finish a sentence,

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.166
 it might make social
 distancing fly by.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.434
 Like, right now we're like,

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.536
 "Oh, we're gonna be
 in here for months."

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:13.039
If Obama speaks,
"We've gotta ...

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.411
 "We gotta ...

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.646
  "be safe."

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.615
 And we're like, "Wow,
 it's August already.

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.283
"I guess we can go outside now.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.185
"Thanks, Obama."

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:27.053
 Now, Trump held
 another presser today,

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.755
  where he said that
  America and Canada

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:32.225
are closing their border
to non-essential travel.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.760
 Yeah.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.729
  And that actually made me
  kinda feel bad for Trump,

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.465
 because he's finally
 getting the border shutdown

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:39.933
  he always wanted.

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.168
 It's just happening with
 the wrong country, you know?

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:43.470
 Which sucks for him.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.605
It's kinda like wishing
for more vacation days,

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:47.207
 but then get fired.

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:50.577
 You sort of get what you
 want, but it's not the same.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.979
 And so, from now on,
 only essential travel,

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.583
only essential travel is allowed
into Canada from the U.S.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.019
  So, stuff like government
  business, trade,

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.154
and your boy's bachelor
party in Montreal,

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.523
 but that's it, nothing else.

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.025
See you there, Brandon.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.293
 And like ...

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:08.128
You know, I just wonder
if this is gonna work.

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:11.197
'Cause you know
Canadians are so polite,

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.565
 I bet if you showed
 up at the border,

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.067
they'd still let you in.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:15.935
 They'd be like, "Oh, gosh,
 I'm really not supposed to,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:19.172
"eh, Trevor, but I can't
say no to new friends.

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.507
  "Come on in, eh?"

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.376
  I don't even know if that
  was a Canadian accent,

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:24.244
 to be honest.

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:27.514
 I don't even think I
 remember a Canadian--

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:29.149
  I feel like I ...

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.717
 I haven't been around
 people for so long,

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:32.786
 I don't know what any
 accent sounds like.

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:35.588
That could be Canadian.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.324
 For all I know, all the
 accents in my head are wrong.

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:38.625
  Maybe it's been that long.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:41.661
 This corona self-distancing,

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:46.333
 it's gonna be making up random
 accents that are incorrect.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:49.336
  "Yeah, so sorry
  about, about that.

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:51.538
  "Yes, welcome to Toronto.

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:53.206
 "Yes, I'm Canadian.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.441
  "Yes, yes.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:56.710
 "Sorry, yeah.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.644
  "But, but.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.646
 "Oh, you want maple syrup?"

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.283
 Oh, one other thing
 I wanna mention.

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:05.652
Doctors need our help right now.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:08.154
 Yes, doctors need our help.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.390
 Because there are many
 stories coming out

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.259
 that a lot of young people,
 especially in New York,

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.228
  have been going to
  emergency rooms,

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:18.798
  looking for a corona
  test when they don't have

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:22.769
  serious symptoms, and the
  hospitals are overwhelmed.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.637
They can't handle that.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:25.905
 Like, I know.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.374
 I know that they've
 shut down the bars,

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:28.675
  so maybe you think the
  ER's the hot new hangout,

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.176
 but it's not, people.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:31.878
  Yes, they have alcohol,
  but it's rubbing alcohol.

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:33.346
It's not the same thing.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.082
  When you go to an ER, and
  it's not an emergency,

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.450
 you're overloading the system.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.685
  You're overloading
  the hospitals.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.520
 You're taking care
 away form the people

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.422
in really desperate situations.

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:45.091
  So if you're feeling sick
  but it's not that serious,

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:46.993
  just self-isolate
  for a few days.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.228
This is not from me, by the way.

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:49.896
 This is what the CDC
 has told us to do.

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:52.332
 If you're feeling
 sick, stay at home,

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:55.969
 self-isolate for a few days,
 and you see if you get better.

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:57.437
  All right?

00:08:57.437 --> 00:08:59.172
 Emergency rooms are like
 flights on Spirit Airlines.

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:02.175
You should only go
there as a last resort.

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:03.410
Spirit Airlines.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.545
Thanks to corona, we're
not the worst anymore.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.349
  All right.

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:11.151
  I've been alone in this
  apartment for a few days.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.319
 I could use some
 human conversation,

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:16.289
 so let's call up Roy Wood, Jr.

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:21.294
 and see what he's up to with
 the magic of technology.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.064
  (ringing)

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:27.734
Yo, Roy!

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:28.568
What's goin' on?

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.536
- Yeah.

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.004
 Yo.

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:33.039
How's it goin' over there, man?

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.674
 - I've missed your face, man.

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:36.176
 This is fun.

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:37.777
 - I'm all right, man.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.379
  I'm doin' okay over here.

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:43.516
  My three-year-old flushed
  a full bar of soap

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:47.287
 down the toilet, so
 for about 14 hours

00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:48.688
 we didn't have
 nowhere to take a du--

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:49.889
 Like, you ever had--

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.458
 pray you don't have
 to take a dump,

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:52.959
 'cause you know you can't ta--

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.062
 Like, this is the worst time
 to need another bathroom.

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:57.530
  Other than your--
  - Wait.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.834
  Wait, so your son flushed
  soap down the toilet?

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:02.068
 - Not soap, don't say soap.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.470
 It's a bar of soap.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.139
  A whole ass bar of
  soap, brand new,

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:08.141
  and it got clogged
  in the corner.

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:10.343
 So I went on Twitter
 asking questions

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:11.578
 and somebody--
 - But why didn't you just--

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.880
 Yeah, so why didn't
 you just pull it out?

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.381
- 'Cause it's down under there.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:19.452
 You know, the toilet, the
 turd goes down, up, and down.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.553
When a turd goes--
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:21.387
It's that thing.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.689
Okay, yeah, that thing.

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:24.958
- So the soap was there.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:25.992
 So I couldn't get ...

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.360
- Right.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.628
  - So I had to ...

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:33.700
  Hanger, I tried--
  (child yelling)

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.268
 - Is that him?

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:36.469
 - Yeah, man.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.404
  (laughing)

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:41.441
 - You know, dude, the only
 thing worse than coronavirus

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:44.911
 is having coronavirus shutdown
 and kids at the same time.

00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:48.081
 I have never been happier to
 not have a child in my life.

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:49.716
  (laughing)

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.051
 - He just yells for no reason.

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:53.820
  (laughing)

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.855
  - Does he even understand
  what the shutdown is?

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.390
  Does he understand
  self-distancing.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.292
- He think this is spring break.

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:01.027
 He keeps waking up,
 he goes, "School?"

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:02.228
 And I go, "No school."

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.998
And he goes, "Yeah, no school!"

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.166
 And then I make grilled
 cheese sandwiches all morning.

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.636
 Grilled cheese and
 apples every morning.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:10.603
 - Man.

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:11.538
 I feel sorry for you.

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.072
  I'm sorry.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:13.973
- How you doin'?

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:14.807
 - I'm good, I'm great.

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:16.009
 I won't lie.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.243
 Like, I mean, I'm
 worried about people.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.645
 I don't know where
 the world is going.

00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:20.580
 I'll tell you, the
 biggest stress I have

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.283
is that I don't know if
I have corona or not,

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:24.450
'cause you don't show symptoms,

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.085
 so I don't know if I have it.

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.787
 What if I already had
 it, and then like,

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.122
 maybe I don't have it anymore.

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:30.657
Do you know what I mean?

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.926
  And then like, I'm immune,
  I could be in the streets.

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:35.028
 But now I don't know,
 because I haven't,

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.529
  'cause I can't get tested.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.265
 You can't get tested unless
 you really show symptoms,

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.833
so I don't know.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.536
  So, yeah, that's the only
  frustrating thing for me.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.105
 - It's like a lot of famous
 people are getting tested.

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.640
  That's what it seems like.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.309
 Seem like what you need to do,

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:50.810
  you need to do
  what I'm gonna do.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.078
 I'm joining the NBA.

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:55.315
  That's how I'm
  gonna get my test.

00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:56.916
 I already thought about this.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.385
 I already ordered a
 jersey and everything.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.654
 - That doesn't, I
 don't even know ...

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:02.655
 What are you saying?

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.695
 - If you want to get tested
 for corona, join the NBA.

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.965
 NBA show symptom, they
 test 'em immediately.

00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:14.300
  They tested all
  of the Utah Jazz.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.569
 They tested all of the
 Oklahoma City Thunder.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.770
When it first--
- Oh yeah.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.238
  Yeah, the Brooklyn
  Nets, I think,

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.974
 what, four players got tested.

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:22.141
- Yeah.

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.376
 - Oh, no, four players
 were confirmed.

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:24.510
 Yeah, they tested everybody.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.745
- Yeah.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.213
  So, if you want
  to get a test ...

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:28.848
 I've been lookin' on the TV,

00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:30.316
all I see are these corona tests

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:32.685
and people lining up
at 6:00 in the morning.

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:34.988
 The testing doesn't
 start til 9:00.

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:37.924
 You don't even up that
 early for Jordans.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:41.027
 You get to the mall a hour
 before it opened for Jordans.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:42.495
And people are there four hours.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:44.697
That's how dire this is.

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:45.898
  - That's like the new ...

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.166
 The way you just said
 it makes it sound

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.602
 like corona testing is
 gonna be the new swag.

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:52.038
- Yeah.

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.373
- Like rappers are
gonna be in their videos

00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:55.875
  like, "Yeah, got
  that corona test.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.111
"Got all corona tests."

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.846
- Yeah, with a (garbled speech)

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:02.582
 mask on.
 - Bugattis and corona tests.

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.350
- With a N95 mask on they face.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.652
  (laughing)

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:07.353
Hey, hey, you ain't got my mask.

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:08.921
Bitch I got the mask.
- Got that corona test.

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.856
Yo, yo, corona.

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.427
  Wait, but now ...

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:16.863
 But now, if you say
 celebrities get it,

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:19.132
then how come we
haven't gotten the test?

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.969
 - I think this is ...

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.804
  If there's ever
  a time to confirm

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.806
 whether or not you an
 A-list celebrity ...

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.374
 - Wow.

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:30.176
 - This is the time.

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.478
  'Cause if you look at the
  celebrities that's got it,

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:33.746
  top shelf.

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.148
 Idris Elba.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.149
 - Tom Hanks.
 - Tom.

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.520
 They're people that
 are bonafide stars.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.155
 - Wow.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.524
 - If you're doin'
 Hallmark movies, you
 might not get a test.

00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:46.025
They might just not ...

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:46.859
 I'm nervous.

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:47.694
 I'm gonna be honest.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.028
This is myself included.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.431
  (laughing)

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.598
  You might be good.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.334
  - Oh, man.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:56.836
  I haven't gotten the test,
  though, so I mean ...

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.539
- I'm saying, if we was both
in line to get the corona test,

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.241
 and the swab lady
 came down the line,

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:05.078
 she's be like, "Oh,
 Trevor Noah, come."

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.279
And I'd be like,
"What about me?"

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:07.680
 And she's be like,
 "No, Anthony Anderson.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.848
  "I don't watch Black-ish."

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.250
  (laughing)

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.219
  That's what would happen.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:15.688
  - Oh, man!

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.323
  Oh, dude.

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:18.725
 I hope you're wrong.

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.193
 I hope you're wrong.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.494
 I heard too many people
 are trying to get the test,

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:23.229
 so maybe that's a good thing.

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:24.764
 I don't know.

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:29.035
 Or maybe they should say
 every NBA player/movie star

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.269
 that gets tested has to bring

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:31.537
  a friend to get
  tested with them.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.540
Maybe that's how we get
the thing to everybody.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.109
  - I probably should wear--

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:39.679
 I got more baseball gear in
 my house than basketball.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:43.149
 And I know that for
 sure I have enough

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:46.119
to make three-fourths of
a Chicago Cubs uniform.

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:49.021
 I have a hat, I have a glove,

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.556
I have a jersey, I have cleats.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:51.758
  I just need pants.

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:53.493
 - And who are you
 gonna be on the team?

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:55.561
 When they say, "Oh, you
 play for the Chicago Cubs?"

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:57.363
 who are you gonna say you are?

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.198
- They probably won't
believe I play baseball

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:00.133
  'cause I'm black.

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:02.001
 It ain't but eight of us left.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.403
 So, I probably
 gotta learn Spanish

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.506
and trick 'em in to
thinking I'm Dominican.

00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:07.974
  I don't--

00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:10.676
  Look, I'm just hoping
  that we continue to remain

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:14.313
  alone together and that
  I don't get any symptoms.

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.681
(child yelling)

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.016
 - Is that ...

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.117
 - Hey, let me go, man.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.621
 - Is everything okay?

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.889
- This boy, man.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:23.723
  I'm sorry.

00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:26.259
- Roy, what's going on?

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:27.260
 - I'm sorry.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.194
 Ay!

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:29.829
 Stop eatin' the toilet tissue!

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.398
This boy's eatin' toilet tissue.

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.133
  That's like eatin' money.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:35.401
 That's actually worse
 than eatin' money.

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:36.903
 Ay, eat this $20 bill.

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:38.171
 Don't do that.

00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:39.372
  - Roy, are you ...

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.446
  All right, I'll
  chat to you later.

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:51.050
 (Roy screams)

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.554
 Uh, all right, cool.

00:15:54.554 --> 00:15:55.488
 Thanks, Roy.

00:15:55.488 --> 00:15:57.256
  I'll chat to you tomorrow.

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:01.194
If your kid's not eating
more toilet paper.

00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:03.262
 Oh, speaking of kids
 eating toilet paper,

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:07.700
before we go, school,
in America specifically,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.437
 is where millions of kids get
 their lunch every single day.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.407
 But with many schools
 closed down right now,

00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:16.342
 these kids could use our help.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:18.411
 So if you can help, please,

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:19.912
 if you can donate
 anything right now.

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:22.048
  I know it's hard,
  but if you can,

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:27.053
 please go to nokidhungry.org
 and give what you can.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.355
 You can help
 children get a meal.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.257
 It might be their
 only meal of the day.

00:16:31.257 --> 00:16:33.593
 And if you want to help in
 New York City specifically,

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:36.295
 please go to cityharvest.org.

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:39.165
  In times like this, we
  all need to pull together

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:43.302
 and help out however we can,
 because it's gonna be a ride,

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.304
 and the only way we
 can make this journey

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:49.075
 a little more tolerable is
 if we travel on it together.

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:49.909
 Wow, that was deep.

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:51.677
 I just made that up.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:52.578
  That was powerful.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:55.648
  So, yeah.

00:16:55.648 --> 00:16:57.750
  That's The Daily Social
  Distancing Show for today.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.285
I'm Trevor Noah.

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:00.920
  Stay out there, stay safe.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.489
  Please, distance
  yourself socially,

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:05.491
 but connect with
 each other digitally.

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:08.861
 And I'll catch up with
 everybody tomorrow.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.797
  But before we go, here it
  is, your moment of zen.

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.566
 - [Reporter] This Los
 Angeles grocery store

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:16.335
 also offering special
 hours for seniors.

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.970
 - We have a package for you.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.173
 - [Reporter] And in Chicago,
 a non-profit putting together

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:24.277
 and delivering care
 packages to seniors in need.

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:26.012
  - This is something that's
  gonna affect everybody.

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:27.680
  We just have to do a
  better job of recognizing

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.182
 the humanness or the
 Americanness of each of us,

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:33.386
 and if we're gonna rise outta
 this, we gotta do it together.
