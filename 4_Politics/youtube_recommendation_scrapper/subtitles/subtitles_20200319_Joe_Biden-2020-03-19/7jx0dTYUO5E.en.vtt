 Translator: Mahmoud Aghiorly Auditor: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.330
 Well, now I'm going to show you some pictures 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
 Of interesting research 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.330
 In the medical journal Ultrasound 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
 I think it is the most interesting research 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
 It was published in the medical journal Ultrasound from its inception 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
 Its title is Notes on Intrauterine Masturbation 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 (Laughter) 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.330
 Well, on the left now you can see the hand, this big arrow 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 And the penis on the right, and the hand hovering around 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
 On this side we see 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
 As the radiologist says Israel Meisner 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 "The hand holds the penis in a way that represents masturbation movements." 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.330
 Notice that these are ultrasound 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
 So the pictures were supposed to be animated 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
 Now, this part of the nervous system 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 He is responsible for the things that we do not control voluntarily 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 Like digestion, heart rate, and sexual arousal 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 And this sexual tremor can be provoked 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.330
 With a surprising number of means 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 Stimulating sexual organs, of course 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 But Kinsey also interviewed a woman 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
 You can reach the sexual thrill 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
 By caressing her eyebrow by someone else 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330
 People with spinal cord injuries 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
 Like various types of paralysis 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330
 They often have very sensitive places 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 The highest area of ​​injury 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
 Wherever this is 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.330
 He mentioned something in the literature about euphoria through the knee 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.330
 And I think the most interesting thing I have ever encountered 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330
 It is a case of a woman 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 She gets to orgasm every time she brushes her teeth 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 (Laughter) 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 This was due to 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.330
 Brush movement while brushing teeth 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
 Than what he used to reach for orgasm 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.330
 This woman went to a neurologist and was amazed 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 And check if the toothpaste was caused 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
 But no, it was with any paste you use 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
 And they tried to stimulate the gums 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
 With a toothpick, to see if this is the cause of the problem 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.330
 But no, the reason was the movement 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
 And the amazing thing is 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
 You think this woman has 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
 Mouth very clean 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.330
 (Laughter) 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330
 Unfortunately, no - that's what was said in the magazine. 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
 She thought she was haunted by evil spirits 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.330
 And she used mouthwash to clean her mouth 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
 It is sad 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.330
 (Laughter) 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
 When I was writing the book 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.330
 I met a woman who could reach euphoria with imagination 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
 She was involved in a study taking place at Rutgers University 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
 You should love this, "Rutgers Students". 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.330
 So I interviewed her in Auckland 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
 At a sushi restaurant 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.330
 And I said, "Well, can you do it here?" 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
 And she replied, "Yes, I can, but I prefer to finish my meal if you don't mind." 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.330
 (Laughter) 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
 But then she was good enough to show me how to do it 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.330
 On a bench outside 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.330
 It was remarkable and took about a minute 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.330
 Then I told her 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
 "Are you doing this all the time?" 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.330
 (Laughter) 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.330
 She said, "No, in fact when I get home I often get tired." 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
 (Laughter) 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.330
 She told me that the last time I did it 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.330
 She was on a Disneyland train 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.330
 (Laughter) 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
 The main center of ecstasy and spinal nerve 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.330
 It's something called the sacral nerve root and it's located behind here 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
 And if you stimulate or excite by an electric charge 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.330
 For a specific area you get an orgasm 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.330
 And it is possible to elicit reactions from the spinal nerve 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.330
 In the dead 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
 A certain kind of dead, have a still beating heart 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.330
 This person will be brain dead 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
 He is considered legally dead 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
 But he lives on a ventilator 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.330
 Where oxygen is delivered to the body's organs 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.330
 In order to transfer it 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.330
 Now if you take a brain-dead person 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
 And I stimulated a specific point 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
 You will see something happen 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
 It's called "Lazarus" reaction. 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.330
 That is, I will make it as clear as I can not as a dead person 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
 This is what happens, you stir a specific position 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.330
 So the dead do this 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
 A worrying thing for those working in anatomy laboratories 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.330
 (Laughter) 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.330
 Now, if you could provoke Lazarus' reaction in a dead person 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
 Why does not excite him in it? 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.330
 I asked this question to an expert in brain death 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
 Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to answer my emails 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.330
 (Laughter) 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
 I told him, "So can you 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
 "The excitement of orgasm in a dead person? 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.330
 And she said to me: "Yes, if the oxygen reaches the sacral nerves 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.330
 You can. " 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.330
 Obviously, this wouldn't be fun for a dead person 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
 But it will still be a trance 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.330
 (Laughter) 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.330
 however 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
 In fact I suggested to a researcher at the University of Alabama 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.330
 She is researching orgasm 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.330
 I told her, "You should do an experiment." 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.330
 You can get bodies if you work at the university. 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
 I told her, "Actually, you should do it." 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
 She replied: "You must obtain the approval of the Human Resources Committee to do this." 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
 (Laughter) 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
 According to the author of the marriage book of 1930 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.330
 Theodore van de Veld 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.330
 You can find a slight smell of semen in the same woman 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.330
 Within an hour after the sexual relationship 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.330
 Theodore Van de Veld was a bit of a semen expert 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330
 (Laughter) 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
 And this is another person who is the author of "The Perfect Marriage". 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.330
 A lover of the opposite sex 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
 He wrote in his book 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.330
 It can differentiate the semen of a young person 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.330
 It is characterized by a fresh and fresh aroma 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
 The semen of an adult 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
 Which is characterized by "Mona" smell, as he says: 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
 Similar to the smell of Spanish chestnut 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
 Sometimes it smells fresh like flowers 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
 Others are pungent 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.330
 (Laughter) 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.330
 Well, in the year 1999 in the State of Israel 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.330
 A person was injured in Al-Hazouqa 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.330
 This situation has continued without interruption 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
 And he did everything that his friends suggested 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.330
 But none of them succeeded 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.330
 Days passed, and at some point 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.330
 And hiccups were still going on, when he was having sex with his wife 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
 Hiccups have gone! 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.330
 A female doctor told him about it ... and who played a role in spreading a research message about the matter 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.330
 In the Canadian medicine newspaper themed 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
 Sex quotas as a potential treatment 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
 For the intractable Hiccups " 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.330
 I liked this article because it was suggested at some point 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.330
 Those with hiccups and those not associated with one of the masturbation experiences 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.330
 (Laughter) 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.330
 She liked this because she gave some demographic profile to those who suffer from hiccups who are "single" - unrelated - 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.330
 (Laughter) 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:22.330
 That is, people are classified as (married - singles - singles but have hiccups) 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.330
 In 1900 specifically its inception 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.330
 Gynecologists believed ... many of them 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.330
 That when a woman reaches her sexual thrill 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.330
 The contractions that accompany them are aimed at pulling the semen into the cervix 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.330
 As a kind of help quickly deliver it to the egg 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
 The possibility of fertilization increases 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
 This theory was called "absorption inward". 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.330
 (Laughter) 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.330
 Going back to the time of the physical "Hippocrates" 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
 Then the doctors thought that the woman’s sexual tremor 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.330
 Not only beneficial to fertilization but necessary for it 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.330
 The doctors automatically told the men 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.330
 On the importance of satisfying their wives 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
 And the author of the marriage guide and expert to smell semen 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.330
 Theodore van de Veld 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.330
 (Laughter) 

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.330
 Mentioned in his book 

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.330
 And I love this man .. Theodore Van de Veld taught me a lot 

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
 It was mentioned in his book 

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.330
 Something that supposedly came from "Royal Habsburg" 

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.330
 Where was Empress Maria Theresa 

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.330
 She was having trouble getting pregnant 

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.330
 Where the group of doctors told her then 

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.330
 "We think it should 

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.330
 Your Majesty's vagina is to be done 

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
 Configure - stimulate - before sexual intercourse " 

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.330
 (Laughter) 

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.330
 This story appears to be in one of the historical references 

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.330
 Let's go back to the 1950s to Masters and Johnson 

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.330
 Masters and Johnson did not like the theory of absorption inward 

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330
 And that was funny to them 

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.330
 They did not believe her 

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
 Masters and Johnson decided 

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
 They will understand it themselves 

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
 So they brought the women to their laboratory ... and I think they brought 5 women 

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
 They were stripped naked and injected into their cervix 

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
 With artificial semen 

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.330
 This was an artificial semen 

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.330
 Dark matter absorbs radiation and ... 

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
 Can be seen by X-rays. 

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
 This was in the 1950s 

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.330
 Then these women were placed in front of the X-ray machine. 

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
 They were asked to masturbate 

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.330
 Masters and Johnson monitored the artificial semen if it was absorbed or not 

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
 But they found no evidence of that - absorption - 

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.330
 You may ask how to make semen? 

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
 (Laughter) 

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
 And I have the answer for you .. Actually, I have two answers 

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.330
 You can use flour and water ... or cornstarch and water 

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.330
 And I found in the literature .. three recipes for making semen 

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.330
 (Laughter) 

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.330
 And I was impressed with one of the books 

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
 As you know - you now have a list of ingredients 

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.330
 For example in the usual method of preparation they say .. 

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
 Loudly: 12 candy bars 

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
 But in this recipe it is said, "Bring one toss ..." 

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.330
 (Laughter) 

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
 There is another way in which sexual thrills can increase fertility 

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
 These are related to men 

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.330
 Semen that remains in the body for a week or more 

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.330
 It may develop some kind of anomaly which it makes 

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
 Sperm "Ras" is less effective during its course 

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.330
 Toward the egg 

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
 The sex world says "Roy Levin" 

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.330
 Expecting the reason for the desire's development 

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.330
 Men's enthusiasm for masturbation 

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
 He says "If you continue to ejaculate by masturbation .. 

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
 Because I will get fresh semen periodically. " 

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.330
 I find this interesting because I am with this theory 

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
 Masturbation became justified .. as a motivation for eugenics by virtue of the theory of development and advancement 

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.330
 (Laughter) 

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
 Okay 

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
 (Laughter) 

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.330
 Well ... there is evidence that can be taken into account about the theory of internal absorption 

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
 Pigs, for example 

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.330
 And in Denmark ... where the Danish National Pig Production Association said 

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.330
 They discovered that he had a farmer 

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.330
 Sexually stimulated for the pig during the process of artificial insemination 

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.330
 This will increase the percentage of "rendering" by 6%. 

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.330
 This is the number of pigs produced from artificial insemination 

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.330
 So they suggested a five-step plan for sexual stimulation 

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
 Industrial fertilization 

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.330
 Then it was promoted to farmers - flyers were distributed to the stables 

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.330
 And they have DVDs for operation 

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
 And I got a copy of that DVD 

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.330
 (Laughter) 

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.330
 I am not hiding anything from you because I will show you a scene of that 

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
 (Laughter) 

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
 Well .. ah .. well 

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330
 Well here we go to work .. 

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.330
 This looks very innocent 

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.330
 Here he does some work with his hands 

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.330
 The pig performs his "snout" because he has no hands 

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.330
 (Laughter) 

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.330
 This is ... the pig has several methods of courtship reference 

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.330
 (Laughter) 

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
 Here are simulated pig weight 

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
 (Laughter) 

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.330
 You should know .. that the "clitoris" of a female pig is in her vagina 

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.330
 So this work leads to its excitement .. Here it is! 

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:20.330
 (Laughter) 

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
 And here we got the happy result 

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
 (clap) 

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
 I love this video 

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
 And there is a goal from this file back to the introduction 

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
 When the image was rounded to the wedding ring in his hand 

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:35.330
 They also say, "It is okay. This is his job ... and he really loves his wife." 

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.330
 (Laughter) 

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.330
 Well ... I said that when I was in Denmark I was hosting "Anne Marie" 

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:48.330
 And I said, "Well, why don't you stimulate the clitoris of a female pig?" 

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.330
 Why do not you push farmers to provoke it directly 

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.330
 Why clitoral stimulation is not among the five stages of your method? " 

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.330
 She said .. I want to read you what she said because I like him 

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
 She said "It was very difficult 

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
 Convince farmers to touch the bottom of the vagina .. 

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330
 We told ourselves, 'Let's not mention the clitoris now!' " 

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.330
 (Laughter) 

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.330
 For ambitious and shy farmers. They can ask - that's a fact - 

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.330
 Vibrating device 

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.330
 The semen syringe is attached to it by "tube" 

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.330
 Because as I mentioned earlier 

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.330
 The clitoris is inside the vagina 

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.330
 So theoretically. Female pig can get a little more excitement than it is now 

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
 And from Qom I told her 

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.330
 "These females ... I mean, as you may have seen before 

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.330
 They do not show signs of complacency or euphoria. 

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
 She replied, "You can't check this 

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
 Because the animals do not appear on 

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
 Its faces are signs of pain or pleasure ... as is the case with us as human beings. 

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.330
 Understand .. pigs as dogs for example 

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
 She uses the upper part of her face for expression .. She sees the ears moving more expressively 

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
 So it is not possible to know what is really happening with the female pig 

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.330
 On the other hand, sophisticated animals use their mouth more for expression 

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.330
 For example. The expression when tossing in a tailed tail macaque 

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
 (Laughter) 

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.330
 Surprisingly, this expression was also observed in female macaques 

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.330
 But when he was molesting other macaques 

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.330
 (Laughter) 

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.330
 Masters and Johnson decided in the 1950s 

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:14.330
 They must discover the full human response cycle 

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.330
 From the start of arousal to the sexual tremor in both men and women 

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.330
 They discover everything ... it happens inside the human body 

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.330
 Well for women, a lot happens inside their bodies, not outside them, as men do 

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.330
 But this did not discourage Masters and Johnson 

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.330
 They have developed an industrial machine that simulates intercourse 

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
 It is essentially an "artificial penis" equipped with an optical camera and motor 

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.330
 Any rod 

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.330
 Really bar .. with camera and lighting lamp 

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.330
 Connected to a motor that works like this ..! 

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.330
 They tell the women to imagine the sexual process with him 

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
 And that's what they're going to do ... an interesting thing 

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
 Unfortunately, this device has been dispensed with 

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
 This saddens me very much ... not because I want to use it 

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.330
 Because I want to see him 

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.330
 (Laughter) 

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.330
 One day 

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.330
 Alfred Kinsey decided 

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.330
 To calculate the average distance traveled by the semen 

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.330
 This was not just a curiosity 

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.330
 Dr. "Kinsey" heard 

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
 A, there is a theory of a king in the early 1940's 

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
 You talk about the ejaculation force of semen 

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
 Inside the vagina 

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
 It has a direct impact on the potential for fertilization 

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.330
 And Kinsey thought that was nonsense ... so he decided to check this out 

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
 He gathered in his laboratory 

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.330
 300 men with metric tape measure and camera 

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
 (Laughter) 

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
 And he found a fact that says .. 

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.330
 That three-fourths of men 

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.330
 They were just throwing out 

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.330
 The semen was not released for a great distance or with great force 

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.330
 But the record holder at the time 

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
 Fling eight steps ... which is really interesting 

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.330
 (Laughter) 

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.330
 (clap) 

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.330
 Yes in deed 

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.330
 (Laughter) 

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.330
 Unfortunately, his name is unknown and he will remain "unknown". 

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.330
 And in his subsequent report 

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.330
 In his report on this experience in his book 

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.330
 Kinsey Books 

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.330
 "The newspapers were laid out to protect the oriental carpets I had." 

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.330
 (Laughter) 

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.330
 This phrase is my second favorite phrase 

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.330
 In my review of Alfred Kinsey's research 

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.330
 And my first phrase is, "the cheese crumbs that are spread before the mice. 

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.330
 The mind only distracts the female and does not distract the male's mind! " 

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.330
 (Laughter) 

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
 Thank you very much 

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.330
 (clap) 

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
 Thank you !
