00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.160
 So we’re going to start off with the inaugurations of these two presidents, Obama and Trump. 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:21.640
Give me a sense of—of who Obama is, who Trump is, what their aspirations are and how they deal—

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:34.392
 Barack Obama and Donald Trump are probably on the opposite sides of the continuum of 

00:00:34.392 --> 00:00:49.456
Obama is very cool, very unruffled, very eager to reach consensus; doesn’t like conflict; 

00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:56.487
feels very much a sense of responsibility to the nation as a whole.

00:00:56.487 --> 00:00:58.386
Donald Trump is just the reverse. 

00:00:58.386 --> 00:01:04.163
Donald Trump loves conflict, loves chaos, doesn’t really feel any responsibility to the nation, 

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:13.480
really feels that his future is based upon his own followers; wants to divide the nation; loves confrontation.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.864
 Take us to the promise of Obama. 

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:25.846
Here’s someone who sold his biography as someone who could bridge the gaps, why he appealed—

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:30.658
what was he, how he came across and why he appealed to so many voters.

00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:37.638
 Barack Obama genuinely believed that he could forge a consensus, 

00:01:37.638 --> 00:01:48.778
that he could bridge the emerging, growing gap across race, across class, across rural and urban America. 

00:01:48.778 --> 00:02:01.248
He appealed to many people because, I think, he touched upon what Lincoln referred to as the “better angels of our nature.” 

00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:12.200
And he wanted Americans to believe that we could forge a new commonality, that we could find a—

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.212
not just a consensus, but that the “We the people” had a real meaning beyond nationalism, 

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:28.128
that the ideals that bound us together were not historic but were future. 

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:38.628
His campaign about hope and the reiteration of hope was hope about the possibility of the country to be a place not just 

00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:46.736
of freedom and liberty, but also hope about the possibility that the whole would be greater than the sum of the parts.

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:54.064
 Now, this appealed to a huge number of Americans, but there were other Americans out there 

00:02:54.064 --> 00:02:59.843
that Sarah Palin attracted, that she tied into. 

00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:01.849
What did she tap into? 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:09.836
Explain what she understood and why there was this population that is out there that was a very different population 

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:12.352
that what was attracted to Obama.

00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:18.127
 Sarah Palin understood that there were a lot of people out there who felt that 

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:19.532
the game was rigged against them. 

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:27.108
They were angry; they felt they were being left behind; that there was a kind of ruling or leadership class, 

00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:38.240
mostly well-educated and coastal, that had contempt for average working people. 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.040
And so she tapped into that anger. 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.917
She tapped into that feeling of bitterness, and it was real, genuine bitterness…

00:03:50.917 --> 00:04:01.216
You have to understand that the financial crisis of 2008 illuminated for much of America 

00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:05.557
what had been happening for many years, but people just didn’t see it. 

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:13.452
They had found ways of coping with stagnant incomes and with a game that looked to them increasingly 

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.797
like it was rigged for the benefit of the wealthy. 

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:27.936
But as long as they could maintain their own incomes through everything from having women enter paid work 

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:35.038
to using their homes as collateral for refinancing their homes and getting deeper and deeper into debt, 

00:04:35.038 --> 00:04:39.893
they could basically persuade themselves that everything was fine.

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:46.656
That financial crisis was a—not just a wakeup call; it was as if a curtain was opened 

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:55.710
and everybody could see the true landscape of America, which was a fairly frightening landscape. 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.272
Most people were not getting anywhere. 

00:04:58.272 --> 00:05:04.216
A small group at the top was basically raking in more and more power and wealth.

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:09.209
 Did Obama understand that population? 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:17.329
Did he understand the consequence of the 2008 recession and how it affected these Americans, 

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:20.256
how it affected and how it divided America?

00:05:20.256 --> 00:05:26.696
 I don’t think Barack Obama understood the degree of vitriol and anger 

00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:35.754
and sense of betrayal that average working Americans felt, particularly after the financial crisis of 2008. 

00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:42.283
Now remember, the median wage hadn’t increased since 1979. 

00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:45.144
I mean, this was something brand-new in America. 

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:50.512
I mean, that entire generation of people expected, for good reason, that they would do better and better and better. 

00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:56.827
But from 1979, 1980 onward, the middle class didn’t. 

00:05:56.827 --> 00:05:58.812
In fact, if anything, the middle class shrunk.

00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:05.092
Now again, when women went into paid work and when everybody worked longer hours and when they used their 

00:06:05.092 --> 00:06:16.121
homes as collateral, they could persuade themselves that this reality of stagnation was not really something that hurt them. 

00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:21.552
… They could pretend that there wasn’t a vast distortion going on in terms of politics and the economy. 

00:06:21.552 --> 00:06:24.892
But after 2008, they couldn’t. 

00:06:24.892 --> 00:06:31.480
Barack Obama did not get that fundamental fact.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:41.380
 How did that event, the events of 2008, define this division in America that we see as of today? 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.808
I mean, looking back at that moment, how consequential, how important a moment that was?

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:52.120
 2008 was an extraordinarily important turning point. 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.985
Out of that disillusionment, anger, that sense of betrayal, came on the right the Tea Party movement, 

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:02.360
and on the left, briefly, the Occupy Movement. 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.328
They were saying essentially the same thing. 

00:07:04.328 --> 00:07:10.553
 The famous moment when the president—President Obama bailed out the banks, 

00:07:10.553 --> 00:07:15.264
the whole meeting where he said, “I’m protecting you from the pitchforks here,” 

00:07:15.264 --> 00:07:23.544
did he understand the consequences of the actions that he took to salvage the economy? 

00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:28.464
But did he understand that anger that you’ve been talking about that was out there 

00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:32.592
and the way he was dealing with these bankers, what the long-term consequences would be?

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:38.212
 I don’t think Obama focused on the long-term consequences of 

00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:44.064
the bailout in terms of the political sociology, if you want to use a fancy term, on the nation. 

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:52.055
His focus was, as I think it should have been, on getting the nation going again, preventing another depression, 

00:07:52.055 --> 00:08:01.736
making sure that the financial crisis did not lead to the kind of apocalyptic economic consequences.

00:08:01.736 --> 00:08:12.995
But in ignoring the larger political fallout, the sociological fallout, the sense of fundamental betrayal, 

00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:20.104
I think he lay the foundation for what we have seen today. 

00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:25.645
… Everybody knew that the bankers got bailed out and no major executive went to jail, 

00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:29.548
and at the same time, homeowners, many of them underwater, 

00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:36.152
owing more on their homes than they could actually get for their homes, they didn’t get help. 

00:08:36.152 --> 00:08:42.528
Millions of people lost their jobs and their savings and, ultimately, their homes. 

00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:48.240
And there was a sense that this was fundamentally unfair. 

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.976
 Leading to, eventually, Donald Trump?

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:59.039
 The sense of unfairness expressed itself on the right in the Tea Party movement, 

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:03.608
on the left in briefly the Occupy Movement. 

00:09:03.608 --> 00:09:09.680
It then in 2016 expressed itself in Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald Trump on the right. 

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:17.577
But Bernie Sanders was the direct lineal descendent of the Occupy Movement, that sense on the left that government 

00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:23.456
had betrayed the people by getting too close to corporations and big banks, and the sense on the right, 

00:09:23.456 --> 00:09:30.642
with Donald Trump, that government had betrayed people by getting too close to the bankers and to big business. 

00:09:30.642 --> 00:09:32.759
And you see, it was essentially the same message. 

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:37.616
It was—it was articulated in slightly different language, in slightly different ways. 

00:09:37.616 --> 00:09:51.168
But Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump became the oracles of this deep-seated sense of betrayal. 

00:09:51.168 --> 00:10:01.228
… I was out in the Midwest doing research for a book and conducting focus groups, free-floating focus groups, 

00:10:01.228 --> 00:10:09.390
all sorts of focus groups, and I remember being struck again and again by the fact that when I asked people 

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:16.448
who they were thinking about for president—and this was before Donald Trump even announced—

00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:22.323
they would say to me, “Well, somebody like either Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump.” 

00:10:22.323 --> 00:10:26.112
And I remember, I would say back: “What? 

00:10:26.112 --> 00:10:28.947
These people, how can you even put them in the same sentence? 

00:10:28.947 --> 00:10:33.225
They are—they’re different—they’re different species.” 

00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:41.276
But what I got back from people, and this was Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and Kentucky and North Carolina, 

00:10:41.276 --> 00:10:46.592
I kept on getting back from people, “Well, they’ll shake things up; they are on our side.”

00:10:46.592 --> 00:10:48.556
 … So let’s talk about health care. 

00:10:48.556 --> 00:10:56.553
The decision to move forward, to push hard for ACA [Affordable Care Act], did they understand the stakes? 

00:10:56.553 --> 00:11:01.976
Did they understand—what were they doing?

00:11:01.976 --> 00:11:02.800
 Who’s they?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.105
 The Obama administration?

00:11:04.105 --> 00:11:10.098
 … [Speaker of the House] Nancy Pelosi really pushed for the Affordable Care Act. 

00:11:10.098 --> 00:11:15.616
She did it because she understood that the chances of the Democrats ever having both the presidency 

00:11:15.616 --> 00:11:22.298
and the House and the Senate again were, you know, de minimis. 

00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:26.247
I mean, it’s not going to happen for years, and this was a window of opportunity. 

00:11:26.247 --> 00:11:30.856
And you bailed out the banks and you did a lot of things that were great for business; 

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.616
now is the time to do something for the public.

00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:43.198
Health care and health insurance was and is still the biggest issue that people worry about. 

00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:50.689
And the Democrats since the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt had been trying to 

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:59.000
widen and enlarge the number of people who would be eligible for health insurance, make it accessible. 

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.278
And this, starting in the ’30s and going right through FDR and Harry Truman, everybody tried. 

00:12:06.278 --> 00:12:08.224
Every Democratic president tried. 

00:12:08.224 --> 00:12:13.482
And yes, Medicare solved some of the problem, and Medicaid solved some of the problem, 

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:20.756
and Child[ren]’s Health Insurance [Program (CHIP)] under Clinton, that solved something. 

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.672
And you had veterans’ insurance. 

00:12:22.672 --> 00:12:28.256
But that left out a lot of people, and medical costs were getting higher and higher as percentage 

00:12:28.256 --> 00:12:30.276
of the typical family’s budget. 

00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:32.280
The Democrats had to do something.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:38.743
 Now, President Obama tries to do it in a way that is palatable to the—to the Republicans. 

00:12:38.743 --> 00:12:47.223
In fact, uses the same tenets that the Republicans had attempted to sell, or in Massachusetts in fact you used. 

00:12:47.223 --> 00:12:54.488
But he gets nowhere with the Republican Party, and he gets not one vote. 

00:12:54.488 --> 00:13:00.883
What’s—what’s the consequences of the decisions to move forward 

00:13:00.883 --> 00:13:06.680
despite the fact that there was no bipartisanship, and sort of where did it lead?

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.713
 … In order to understand what happened with health care, you actually have to go back to the 1990s 

00:13:10.713 --> 00:13:21.005
when Newt Gingrich and his band of radical Republicans took over basically the House and much of Congress. 

00:13:21.005 --> 00:13:25.809
That was the beginning of a partisanship, 

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:32.864
a kind of fierce, angry, no-holds-barred partisanship that lasted all the way through. 

00:13:32.864 --> 00:13:36.370
Barack Obama came into office thinking, well, I can reason with them. 

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:42.890
If I’ve got good arguments, they’re reasonable people, and we’ll come to some reasonable conclusion. 

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.040
Well, he was wrong. 

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.374
That was not there. 

00:13:46.374 --> 00:13:49.057
The Republicans didn’t want to give him any victory. 

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:53.351
It had nothing to do with reason or logic; they just didn’t want to give him a victory. 

00:13:53.351 --> 00:14:02.316
So he did somersaults trying to come out with some sort of a plan that would be amenable to Republicans, 

00:14:02.316 --> 00:14:04.808
and he got absolutely nowhere.

00:14:04.808 --> 00:14:11.628
 And the results, both on the left and the right, of proceeding forward with this non-bipartisan—

00:14:11.628 --> 00:14:19.545
I mean, the fact is for decades later, this battle has been going on back and forth about Obamacare. 

00:14:19.545 --> 00:14:20.665
What were the results? 

00:14:20.665 --> 00:14:21.652
What could have been? 

00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:24.946
What didn’t they see, the Obama administration, that is?

00:14:24.946 --> 00:14:28.318
 Ultimately, Obama got no Republican votes. 

00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:32.158
Now, for those of us who had been in the Clinton administration, 

00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:36.535
we could have told him he was going to get no votes, and we probably did in many ways. 

00:14:36.535 --> 00:14:39.928
But he still thought the power of reason would prevail.

00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:46.480
Getting no Republican votes essentially means this is going to be a partisan issue forever, 

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.464
and the Republicans are going to fight it tooth and nail. 

00:14:51.464 --> 00:14:57.536
I think that in retrospect, in hindsight—and everything is easier in hindsight—

00:14:57.536 --> 00:15:07.056
Obama would have been much better off using the framework of Medicare and simply making it Medicare for All, 

00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:16.087
paid for through your Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, just a very simple, fundamental premise. 

00:15:16.087 --> 00:15:19.256
And everybody loves Medicare; everybody loves Social Security. 

00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:23.011
And so building on that would have been just utterly simple.

00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:30.092
But he creates a kind of Rube Goldberg, complicated mechanism in order to 

00:15:30.092 --> 00:15:37.031
appease the Republicans and also get the insurance companies and everybody else on board. 

00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:44.936
And given that it came out so utterly Republican versus Democrat, 

00:15:44.936 --> 00:15:51.192
that complexity itself made the Affordable Care Act very vulnerable. 

00:15:51.192 --> 00:15:53.440
 It wouldn’t have gotten any more votes from the Republicans, though.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.220
 He wouldn’t have gotten any more Republican votes 

00:15:55.220 --> 00:16:00.000
if he had based it on Medicare, but he wasn’t going to get any Republican votes anyway. 

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.704
That’s the point. 

00:16:00.704 --> 00:16:09.456
In other words, if he’s going to create an affordable health care system, Medicare for All, 

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:17.429
or Medicare with an opt-in, would have at least given him a stronger system that was 

00:16:17.429 --> 00:16:24.408
easily explainable to people and wouldn’t be as vulnerable to the inevitable Republican attacks.

00:16:24.408 --> 00:16:25.028
 … All right. 

00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:29.668
So the Tea Party backlash in the summer of 2009. 

00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:36.880
That blowback about the bill, where does that come from? 

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.243
Are the roots, again, in the economy? 

00:16:41.243 --> 00:16:47.171
You know, what’s your overview of what the meaning of that was that surprised the hell out of 

00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:53.720
both Republicans and Democrats when they went back home and saw these angry crowds? 

00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:03.907
 The Tea Party was an expression of the public’s outrage with what seemed to be 

00:17:03.907 --> 00:17:08.824
a very cozy relationship between government and business. 

00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:12.765
But let’s be very, very candid and clear about this. 

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:21.805
There were Republican operatives, right-wing operatives, that were out there stoking that flame. 

00:17:21.805 --> 00:17:26.385
I mean, they—they wanted to pull the Republican Party even further to the right. 

00:17:26.385 --> 00:17:31.393
They saw that opportunity, and … that opportunity was the financial crisis and the sense of unfairness 

00:17:31.393 --> 00:17:36.546
that so many people felt about what had gone on. …

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:42.243
 The fact that the GOP started—they basically recruited Tea Party members because 

00:17:42.243 --> 00:17:45.648
they realized that it was an easy way to get elected. 

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.828
Did the GOP understand the long-term trends that were going on? 

00:17:48.828 --> 00:17:52.802
Did they understand, perhaps, what gamble that they were getting into here?

00:17:52.802 --> 00:18:02.120
 I doubt that Republicans understood that they were making a deal, in effect, that would 

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:11.605
ultimately lead to a different kind of Republican Party, because they were allying themselves with a grassroots, 

00:18:11.605 --> 00:18:18.466
a so-called grassroots movement that itself had ties to elements in the Republican Party 

00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:22.607
that the establishment Republicans didn’t want to have anything to do with. 

00:18:22.607 --> 00:18:28.560
So by allying themselves with the Tea Party, those establishment Republicans—

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:38.440
and I’m talking about the Republican Party of the ’60s and ’70s and ’80s—that Republican Party spelled its own doom.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:46.460
 They basically bought into a path that they would never have expected, that they would—the leadership would lose their 

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:56.431
job because of, and it would become a party that eventually would be able to pursue and work with a Donald Trump.

00:18:56.431 --> 00:19:00.177
 The Republican Party did not understand—or let’s put it this way: 

00:19:00.177 --> 00:19:07.304
The establishment part of the Republican Party didn’t understand that by allying themselves with the Tea Party, 

00:19:07.304 --> 00:19:17.725
they would be ultimately undermining the principles and the infrastructure that supported the Republican establishment; 

00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:22.256
that they were, in a sense, writing their own death certificate … 

00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:29.656
in a way that would lead to the takeover to the Republican Party by somebody like Donald Trump.

00:19:29.656 --> 00:19:35.127
 2011, the failure of the grand bargain with [then-Speaker of the House John] Boehner and Obama. 

00:19:35.127 --> 00:19:38.706
Number one, to get into it, what were the aspirations? 

00:19:38.706 --> 00:19:40.768
Number two, what were the consequences?

00:19:40.768 --> 00:19:47.040
 The grand bargain with Boehner was doomed from the start. 

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.724
I think the Obama administration really did believe and continued to believe 

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:56.198
that there was a possibility out there for some negotiation. 

00:19:56.198 --> 00:20:00.678
I think Boehner thought, and I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt, 

00:20:00.678 --> 00:20:03.333
but I think Boehner thought there was possibility, too. 

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:20.344
But both Obama and Boehner still believed that their parties were capable of making that kind of a deal. 

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:26.392
But if you just look below Obama and below Boehner, 

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:35.960
you would see that both parties were getting more and more partisan, more and more polarized. 

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:43.272
Now here it’s important to note that the populist Democrats or the populist progressives 

00:20:43.272 --> 00:20:50.000
and the populist Republicans, the grassroots Tea Party Republicans, had a lot in common. 

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.576
They felt that the establishment had shafted them and most Americans.

00:20:56.576 --> 00:21:04.585
But instead of the establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats reaching out to the populist parts 

00:21:04.585 --> 00:21:12.285
of those parties and saying, “OK, yes, campaign finance reform is important; we’ll get big money out of politics; 

00:21:12.285 --> 00:21:19.296
we will—we condemn corporate welfare; we will really use antitrust to break up these big monopolies; 

00:21:19.296 --> 00:21:26.056
we will actually reform the system in ways that make the system respond to average Americans instead of big money,” 

00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:27.156
they didn’t do it. 

00:21:27.156 --> 00:21:27.936
They couldn’t do it. 

00:21:27.936 --> 00:21:29.283
They didn’t understand how to do it. 

00:21:29.283 --> 00:21:38.063
They were entrapped in a kind of old politics that made it impossible for them 

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:44.408
to believe that the entire political structure was being upended.

00:21:44.408 --> 00:21:52.908
 By the election of 2012, Obama’s great quote or statement that he thought the win would 

00:21:52.908 --> 00:22:03.270
break the fever, that there would be a new ability for him to actually get bipartisan actions with the Republicans, 

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.888
how badly did he misunderstand? 

00:22:06.888 --> 00:22:11.868
And of course, you know, soon after that the Newtown killings happened, 

00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:20.589
and the attempt to put forth gun reform took place and started a bipartisan action that went nowhere. 

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:23.029
And that, to some extent I guess, changed their mind a little bit. 

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:25.504
But what did they misunderstand? 

00:22:25.504 --> 00:22:31.968
Why that optimism after 2012, and why was it—why was it sadly wrong?

00:22:31.968 --> 00:22:40.576
 At every step along the way, Obama thought there was a possibility for bipartisanship. 

00:22:40.576 --> 00:22:51.856
But at every step along the way, Obama, just like Republican leaders, failed to understand the underlying dynamics. 

00:22:51.856 --> 00:22:58.088
… Years before, there had almost been bipartisan agreement on immigration. 

00:22:58.088 --> 00:23:04.908
Years before, there had been almost bipartisan agreement on some sort of gun control, 

00:23:04.908 --> 00:23:07.703
some sort of sensible gun policies. 

00:23:07.703 --> 00:23:15.248
Years before, they came pretty close to some bipartisan agreement even on some health care issues 

00:23:15.248 --> 00:23:19.248
that might have led to Medicare for All.

00:23:19.248 --> 00:23:21.248
But that was years before. 

00:23:21.248 --> 00:23:32.496
By the time you get to the Obama administration, the entire structure of bipartisanship had been wrecked. 

00:23:32.496 --> 00:23:34.896
It was wrecked during the 1990s. 

00:23:34.896 --> 00:23:45.125
It’s very easy when you’re inside the political system, when you’re inside Washington, to put blinders on 

00:23:45.125 --> 00:23:55.248
and not see history, not see the results of what had happened even 10 or 12 or 15 or 16 years before, 

00:23:55.248 --> 00:24:00.432
and not see the grassroots, not feel where the public actually is, 

00:24:00.432 --> 00:24:06.664
not understand the degree of partisan outrage and not respond to it.

00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:11.415
 And—and as you said, immigration had almost happened once. 

00:24:11.415 --> 00:24:14.192
It almost happened in 2013- 2014. 

00:24:14.192 --> 00:24:16.246
There was a real belief—the Senate passed it. 

00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:19.546
There was a real belief that they could accomplish something. 

00:24:19.546 --> 00:24:23.424
Something, if it had been accomplished, would have meant that all that we’re seeing right now would—

00:24:23.424 --> 00:24:25.531
would probably not have happened. 

00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:33.351
Why the backlash in the GOP population about when [House Majority Leader Eric] Cantor loses, 

00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:39.791
and why is there this backlash, and why didn’t Obama see it? 

00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:42.488
But more importantly, why—why the backlash?

00:24:42.488 --> 00:24:50.465
 The GOP backlash against any kind of cooperation on issues like immigration occurred 

00:24:50.465 --> 00:24:58.880
for a very simple reason, and that was the GOP saw in immigration a terrific issue to run on. 

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.352
It’s the same thing with guns. 

00:25:01.352 --> 00:25:08.992
It’s the same thing with health care, if it was going to be a massive government operation. 

00:25:08.992 --> 00:25:17.279
You see, the Republican Party by the 2000s had been a party that was looking for every opportunity 

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:27.896
to entrench itself and divide the country, and issues of immigration and guns and national health care, 

00:25:27.896 --> 00:25:35.488
quasi-socialism, those were things that would give the GOP tremendous bargaining leverage, they thought.

00:25:35.488 --> 00:25:41.598
But in order to understand that mentality, you’ve got to go back before. 

00:25:41.598 --> 00:25:49.784
You’ve got to understand that the biggest division in America is not right versus left as we’ve come to understand it. 

00:25:49.784 --> 00:25:52.976
It’s not Democrats versus Republicans. 

00:25:52.976 --> 00:25:58.400
The deepest division is between the vast number of people who are going nowhere 

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:05.424
and the small number of people at the top who are getting richer and more powerful every year. 

00:26:05.424 --> 00:26:15.984
It is in the interest of those people at the top to keep everybody else angry at each other.

00:26:15.984 --> 00:26:23.088
 But in the Republican—the “autopsy” had happened after 2012, and so the thought was 

00:26:23.088 --> 00:26:32.424
we’re losing the game here long term; we need to look more favorably about Hispanic community and such. 

00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:38.224
But this was turned on its head by some people like [Jeff] Sessions and [Steve] Bannon and [Stephen] Miller 

00:26:38.224 --> 00:26:49.648
when they were able to turn the tide on the argument because of an anger that they saw within the GOP base. 

00:26:49.648 --> 00:26:53.352
Explain that a little bit.

00:26:53.352 --> 00:27:02.552
 Economic frustrations can easily be channeled into racism and xenophobia. 

00:27:02.552 --> 00:27:05.128
This is not new. 

00:27:05.128 --> 00:27:17.474
For 150 years, demagogues have taken economic frustrations and actually pointed to what are essentially scapegoats: 

00:27:17.474 --> 00:27:25.231
the other, people who look different, foreigners, people who have different skin pigments, 

00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:27.408
people who have different religions. 

00:27:27.408 --> 00:27:32.616
This is one of the oldest tricks in the demagogue’s playbook.

00:27:32.616 --> 00:27:34.784
 And it worked here.

00:27:34.784 --> 00:27:36.080
 It worked.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:44.320
 So Trump comes down that escalator, the famous speech about immigrants. 

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:54.760
Tie that into the argument you just made about the understanding of how this message resonates and what’s at stake playing this game.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:06.048
 Donald Trump knew intuitively how demonizing them—the other, immigrants, blacks, 

00:28:06.048 --> 00:28:14.190
people who looked and acted differently, even women on occasion—how that would help him 

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:26.552
and help build a base, because it built on frustration and anger, a sense of being left behind, a sense of unfairness. 

00:28:26.552 --> 00:28:36.134
And Trump is—say what you will, he’s a marketing genius. 

00:28:36.134 --> 00:28:52.179
He knows how to get at the emotional chord, the rage, and how to conduct that, how to utilize that emotional chord, 

00:28:52.179 --> 00:29:00.936
that deep sense of betrayal and rage and elevate it, use it, exploit it, make it work politically. 

00:29:00.936 --> 00:29:02.384
And he did it.

00:29:02.384 --> 00:29:12.480
When he announced his candidacy for president, he used Mexicans; he called them rapists and murderers… 

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:19.272
He knew intuitively that that would be a key to his success.

00:29:19.272 --> 00:29:25.069
 He tied into the Sarah Palin people that we were talking about already. 

00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:27.576
He calls them the “forgotten.” 

00:29:27.576 --> 00:29:33.808
How his message resonates with those people, what he understood, something that Obama didn’t understand, 

00:29:33.808 --> 00:29:43.328
but what he understood about the forgotten and the consequences, the effect on his ability to move forward.

00:29:43.328 --> 00:29:46.768
 Remember, this is not a new Republican strategy. 

00:29:46.768 --> 00:29:50.512
Richard Nixon talked about the “silent majority.” 

00:29:50.512 --> 00:29:54.744
George H. W. Bush talked about Willie Horton. 

00:29:54.744 --> 00:29:58.339
Ronald Reagan had talked about “welfare queens.” 

00:29:58.339 --> 00:30:04.512
These were all coded messages about blacks. 

00:30:04.512 --> 00:30:13.696
What Donald Trump did is he took that same framework and he applied it to immigrants 

00:30:13.696 --> 00:30:19.896
and people who would be ostensibly coming across the border. 

00:30:19.896 --> 00:30:26.328
He used nationalism as a vehicle for conducting hate.

00:30:26.328 --> 00:30:27.768
Again, this is not new. 

00:30:27.768 --> 00:30:29.440
In history, this is not new. 

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:37.543
I think it’s very easy to forget how many demagogues have used nationalism, confused it with patriotism, 

00:30:37.543 --> 00:30:41.008
and appealed to the worst instincts in people instead of the best.

00:30:41.008 --> 00:30:44.624
 And bring us up to date on who are these forgotten?

00:30:44.624 --> 00:30:46.375
 … The forgotten Americans are real. 

00:30:46.375 --> 00:30:54.640
The median wage has gone almost nowhere since the late ’70s, early 1980s. 

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:02.144
Most Americans have not seen any gain in their own economic lives, 

00:31:02.144 --> 00:31:06.680
even though the national economy is two to three times bigger than it was.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:14.917
CEOs who in the 1960s took home 20 times what the typical worker was taking home 

00:31:14.917 --> 00:31:19.008
are now taking home 300 times what the typical worker is taking home. 

00:31:19.008 --> 00:31:21.152
People aren’t stupid. 

00:31:21.152 --> 00:31:23.872
The game is rigged. 

00:31:23.872 --> 00:31:30.136
Washington is awash in money, and that money is coming from big corporations and wealthy people. 

00:31:30.136 --> 00:31:40.522
Unions are no longer a major force in politics because they have been busted or made irrelevant 

00:31:40.522 --> 00:31:44.672
or companies have moved to non-union states. 

00:31:44.672 --> 00:31:51.096
So the forgotten people are basically most Americans.

00:31:51.096 --> 00:31:54.738
The question is not are they bad or good. 

00:31:54.738 --> 00:31:57.840
They are decent, hardworking people. 

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.808
The question is, what’s being done for them? 

00:32:02.808 --> 00:32:04.888
What’s being done to them? 

00:32:04.888 --> 00:32:08.760
Are the major parties speaking to them? 

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.784
One of the problems the Democrats have had, and I think one of the problems—biggest problem Hillary Clinton had, 

00:32:14.784 --> 00:32:21.168
she didn’t have a clear and forceful explanation for what happened to the working middle class. 

00:32:21.168 --> 00:32:32.472
 Talk a little bit about Obama’s legacy and how in the world it led to Trump. 

00:32:32.472 --> 00:32:41.296
I mean, what’s the birth of this and how it relates to our first black president?

00:32:41.296 --> 00:32:46.662
 … One way of viewing the journey from Barack Obama to Donald Trump is 

00:32:46.662 --> 00:32:48.328
through the lens of racism. 

00:32:48.328 --> 00:32:56.800
It’s very easy to say, well, we had our first black president, and then we had our first white supremacist president. 

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.688
I think that’s utterly simplistic. 

00:33:00.688 --> 00:33:16.248
The real story is that Barack Obama was a very good and decent 

00:33:16.248 --> 00:33:19.776
He did some very important and good things. 

00:33:19.776 --> 00:33:28.600
He made sure that the economy—the economy didn’t succumb to the great crash of 2008 brought on by the big banks. 

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:35.776
He created the beginnings of a national health care system that nobody thought was possible. 

00:33:35.776 --> 00:33:46.956
But Barack Obama did not respond to the core grievance of America, and that was we’re not getting ahead; 

00:33:46.956 --> 00:33:51.116
the system is rigged; big money is taking over politics. 

00:33:51.116 --> 00:33:58.405
It’s all corporations and Wall Street and the wealthy, and that has to end.

00:33:58.405 --> 00:34:03.664
Barack Obama had Wall Streeters in his office all the time. 

00:34:03.664 --> 00:34:06.352
He hired people from Wall Street. 

00:34:06.352 --> 00:34:10.168
People from Wall Street left the administration, went back to Wall Street. 

00:34:10.168 --> 00:34:17.520
Barack Obama didn’t understand the degree of anger in the population. 

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.520
 And did Hillary Clinton?

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.706
 Hillary Clinton did not understand the degree of anger in the population. 

00:34:23.706 --> 00:34:35.096
Donald Trump intuitively understood, but he used it for his own purposes, and he twisted it into racism and xenophobia.

00:34:35.096 --> 00:34:44.128
 So a big question is how is Trump’s America different than Obama’s America?

00:34:44.128 --> 00:34:50.108
 … Donald Trump has done basically nothing for the so-called forgotten Americans, 

00:34:50.108 --> 00:34:52.536
for the bottom 60%. 

00:34:52.536 --> 00:35:03.144
You know, their wages have grown a little tiny bit, but the big tax cut went mostly to the big corporations and the wealthy. 

00:35:03.144 --> 00:35:13.659
Donald Trump’s regulatory rollbacks have hurt many people because regulations are actually protections 

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:16.243
in terms of health, safety, the environment. 

00:35:16.243 --> 00:35:20.989
The big winners are the big corporations and the very wealthy 

00:35:20.989 --> 00:35:24.944
who are investing in those big corporations because there are more profits.

00:35:24.944 --> 00:35:34.732
But what Donald Trump has done is transformed the anger about a rigged system into racism, xenophobia 

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:40.888
and ugliness of a sort we haven’t had in this country in my lifetime. 

00:35:40.888 --> 00:35:56.304
The only way out, the only alternative, is to respond to not the racism, not the xenophobia, not the misogyny, 

00:35:56.304 --> 00:36:01.311
to respond to the genuine frustrations that people have about a rigged game, 

00:36:01.311 --> 00:36:07.496
about a political system that is no longer working for average people.

00:36:07.496 --> 00:36:11.072
 We will see if that happens.

00:36:11.072 --> 00:36:17.904
 The big question is, are the Democrats capable of responding?

00:36:17.904 --> 00:36:27.064
 Bernie Sanders, as you’ve talked about, was due to the same tribal polarization that we’ve been 

00:36:27.064 --> 00:36:37.272
talking about, but did the—did the left-wing divisions that you’ve talked about, did that help lead to Donald Trump?

00:36:37.272 --> 00:36:46.012
 People who supported Bernie Sanders, most of them supported Hillary Clinton. 

00:36:46.012 --> 00:36:51.554
About one out of every 10 Bernie Sanders voters supported Trump instead of Clinton. 

00:36:51.554 --> 00:36:55.919
But basically the Sanders supporters were Democrats. 

00:36:55.919 --> 00:37:00.072
They recognized the dangers inherent in Donald Trump. 

00:37:00.072 --> 00:37:08.488
… The important point to understand is that minus the racism and xenophobia, 

00:37:08.488 --> 00:37:23.456
the core of the populist Republican Party has much in common with the core of the populist progressive Democratic Party. 

00:37:23.456 --> 00:37:27.944
Both of them talk about the game being rigged… 

00:37:27.944 --> 00:37:37.445
 And this resonated not only among his own base; it resonated amongst a segment of the Democratic Party as well?

00:37:37.445 --> 00:37:42.296
 Look at the 2020 election. 

00:37:42.296 --> 00:37:50.112
In the primaries, in 2019 in the primaries leading up to the 2020 election, 

00:37:50.112 --> 00:37:57.344
almost every Democratic primary candidate has talked about the game being rigged. 

00:37:57.344 --> 00:38:02.464
But what does that mean, actually? 

00:38:02.464 --> 00:38:09.984
If Donald Trump can be elected not just on racism and xenophobia, but also on the game being rigged, 

00:38:09.984 --> 00:38:18.304
and every Democratic candidate is either saying or implying that the game is rigged, what does that tell you? 

00:38:18.304 --> 00:38:26.972
It tells you that something is resonating in the American public when politicians say the game is rigged. 

00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:31.152
People know the game is rigged. 

00:38:31.152 --> 00:38:41.968
 And the results of this battle within the Democratic Party, what are the results going to be?

00:38:41.968 --> 00:38:48.296
 I think it would be a mistake for the Democrats to see Donald Trump as the problem. 

00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:58.493
Donald Trump is the consequence of years of stagnant wages and an overwhelming dominance of corporations 

00:38:58.493 --> 00:39:02.072
and Wall Street and wealthy people in our politics. 

00:39:02.072 --> 00:39:12.112
Donald Trump is what you get when you don’t do anything about stagnant wages and increasing economic insecurity. 

00:39:12.112 --> 00:39:17.772
Democrats have got to understand that there’s no going back to before Donald Trump because 

00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:20.008
before Donald Trump got to Donald Trump. 

00:39:20.008 --> 00:39:27.328
When wages are going nowhere, when people are working harder than ever, when they are losing job security, 

00:39:27.328 --> 00:39:35.968
when 80% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and they don’t have any faith that anybody is 

00:39:35.968 --> 00:39:44.168
looking after them—in fact, they think the system is rigged—we’re going to get Donald Trumps as far as the eye can see.

00:39:44.168 --> 00:39:46.439
 Help connect the dots a little bit. 

00:39:46.439 --> 00:39:54.576
So the early attempt to replace, repeal and replace ACA, Obamacare, 

00:39:54.576 --> 00:40:01.642
but the Republican Congress under Trump really has no plan, and they fail. 

00:40:01.642 --> 00:40:03.632
And Trump attacks them. 

00:40:03.632 --> 00:40:07.849
Now he attacks his own leaders, GOP leadership, if it is his own. 

00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:15.496
And what we then saw was him taking even more authority over to himself, 

00:40:15.496 --> 00:40:21.151
discounting the Congress to some extent, and legislation at all. 

00:40:21.151 --> 00:40:29.168
And the Republicans basically go belly up and cater to every—every one of his wants. 

00:40:29.168 --> 00:40:31.040
What’s going on here?

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.675
 … The Republican Party has disappeared. 

00:40:33.675 --> 00:40:35.522
There is no longer a Republican Party. 

00:40:35.522 --> 00:40:38.720
There is now a party of Donald Trump and Fox News. 

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.013
Let’s be honest about this. 

00:40:41.013 --> 00:40:44.136
There’s not much of a Democratic Party either. 

00:40:44.136 --> 00:40:48.473
I mean, the party structures have almost disappeared. 

00:40:48.473 --> 00:40:52.648
We talk about the Democratic Party, but it’s a bunch of entrepreneurs. 

00:40:52.648 --> 00:40:54.911
Anybody can run for president today. 

00:40:54.911 --> 00:41:01.216
All you have to do is have enough money or have enough name recognition, and you call yourself a candidate. 

00:41:01.216 --> 00:41:04.464
That’s why the Democrats end up with 23 candidates.

00:41:04.464 --> 00:41:09.336
 So how does this help one understand the divided states of America?

00:41:09.336 --> 00:41:15.236
 The center will not hold, not because there’s not a political center but 

00:41:15.236 --> 00:41:21.856
because we have failed to understand that the debate is no longer the old right/left/center. 

00:41:21.856 --> 00:41:27.040
When people talk about wouldn’t it be great to get back to centrism, to moderation, 

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:33.576
what they are thinking about is a 1950s, 1960s, early 1970s politics. 

00:41:33.576 --> 00:41:35.032
Forget that. 

00:41:35.032 --> 00:41:42.416
We now have a society divided between the bottom 60 or 70% of people who are going nowhere, 

00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:49.840
or many of whom are on a downward escalator, and people at the very top who are taking home most of the goodies.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.560
This is not your father’s or mother’s politics. 

00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:00.152
Left, right and center mean nothing in this world. 

00:42:00.152 --> 00:42:08.256
The real issue is who’s going to look out for and who’s going to respond to the bottom 60% 

00:42:08.256 --> 00:42:11.120
who are certain the game is rigged because it is rigged?

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.797
 So a couple of other areas. 

00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:22.520
Charlottesville: The establishment, Republican as well as Democratic establishment, sees it as a disaster. 

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:29.968
How does Trump and his base view it and why?

00:42:29.968 --> 00:42:33.260
 Charlottesville is a disaster. 

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:40.397
The Republican establishment understands it to be a public relations disaster when Donald Trump 

00:42:40.397 --> 00:42:45.288
essentially equates the protesters with the white supremacists. 

00:42:45.288 --> 00:42:49.568
And that’s why a lot of business leaders get off of his business councils. 

00:42:49.568 --> 00:42:56.268
But they also want the tax cut; they also want the regulatory rollbacks, so they’re going to hold their noses 

00:42:56.268 --> 00:42:58.640
and they’re going to go along with Donald Trump. 

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.618
They’re going to go along with his takeover of the Republican Party.

00:43:02.618 --> 00:43:11.072
In other words, the modern Republican strategy, if that’s what you want to call it, is business-friendly: 

00:43:11.072 --> 00:43:18.560
big tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, let the games begin, the money flowing into big corporations 

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.281
and into the stock market and into the hands of wealthy investors. 

00:43:23.281 --> 00:43:34.781
But at the same time you’ve got this—this play, this cartoon going on, and Donald Trump is telling his base that 

00:43:34.781 --> 00:43:41.503
their enemies are immigrants; he’s sounding racist alarms; he is getting people riled up. 

00:43:41.503 --> 00:43:49.744
… In other words, he’s conducting this symphony of ugliness and anger while the Republican establishment is 

00:43:49.744 --> 00:43:51.496
laughing all the way to the bank. 

00:43:51.496 --> 00:43:54.273
Charlottesville is embarrassing for them. 

00:43:54.273 --> 00:43:56.576
They have to get off the business councils. 

00:43:56.576 --> 00:44:05.057
They don’t like the racism, they don’t like all of this divisiveness, but as long as the stock market continues to do well 

00:44:05.057 --> 00:44:10.160
and they get the tax cuts and they get the regulatory rollbacks, they are not going to make a fuss.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:15.023
 And to stay in this territory for a second, so you’ve got, you know, 

00:44:15.023 --> 00:44:17.724
the statements about immigrants coming down the escalator. 

00:44:17.724 --> 00:44:24.464
You’ve got the “shithole countries” meeting when dealing with the potential of immigration reform 

00:44:24.464 --> 00:44:26.695
which goes down the drain, down the toilet. 

00:44:26.695 --> 00:44:34.064
You’ve got him telling congresswomen of color to go back to from where you come from. 

00:44:34.064 --> 00:44:41.038
Is this—how does this define a political strategy, a Trump political strategy? 

00:44:41.038 --> 00:44:43.080
Is that what it is? 

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.128
What is it?

00:44:44.128 --> 00:44:49.816
 Racism and xenophobia is a political strategy. 

00:44:49.816 --> 00:44:54.056
Donald Trump has about 40% of the electorate. 

00:44:54.056 --> 00:44:57.872
They are guaranteed to vote for him. 

00:44:57.872 --> 00:45:04.432
All he needs is to attract another 10, 11, 12%. 

00:45:04.432 --> 00:45:12.652
And given the way the Electoral College is organized, given the very, very big power of some Midwestern states 

00:45:12.652 --> 00:45:20.812
and Iowa and Florida, that’s not going to be impossible for him to do with a strategy that 

00:45:20.812 --> 00:45:25.200
essentially blames those people, “those people.”

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.962
And it’s not just racism. 

00:45:27.962 --> 00:45:29.124
It’s also xenophobia. 

00:45:29.124 --> 00:45:31.532
It’s also a kind of perverted nationalism. 

00:45:31.532 --> 00:45:36.054
It’s a fear of socialism and communism. 

00:45:36.054 --> 00:45:41.806
In other words, it’s a collection of all the fears that traditionally Americans have had, 

00:45:41.806 --> 00:45:54.040
but it’s used at a time when many people don’t feel that the game is fair, where they feel like they haven’t got a fair break. 

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:59.345
This economy is supposed to be good, but their jobs are insecure, and they’re making—

00:45:59.345 --> 00:46:00.420
they’re not making enough money. 

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.544
They don’t blame Trump for that. 

00:46:02.544 --> 00:46:06.552
They blame the establishment; they blame the people who run the system.

00:46:06.552 --> 00:46:12.622
 But the dependence, for instance, on immigration, on the last election and this election, 

00:46:12.622 --> 00:46:22.111
the willingness to shut down the government harmed a lot of people based upon the idea that he needed to stand up 

00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:24.750
for what he had said and he was going to build this wall no matter what. 

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.978
The establishment was preventing him from doing so. 

00:46:27.978 --> 00:46:33.248
It seems central to his presidency, to the forgotten. 

00:46:33.248 --> 00:46:35.002
But why? 

00:46:35.002 --> 00:46:41.974
If that strategy, as you’ve sort of said, doesn’t—will probably not bring the majority that you need, if you’re only selling 

00:46:41.974 --> 00:46:53.312
fear, if you’re only selling the other as the reason why you need to vote for him, why does he continue with that policy?

00:46:53.312 --> 00:47:02.688
 Donald Trump continues to sell fear and xenophobia, racism and misogyny 

00:47:02.688 --> 00:47:09.480
because he knows he’s got 40% of the electoral and all he needs is another 11%. 

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:20.760
And that’s all he has because the tax cut did not help anybody, and his trade wars haven’t helped anybody. 

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.720
And most people can look around and say, “Well, you know, in terms of where I am, 

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.360
the economy is supposed to be better and the stock market is pretty good, 

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.980
but I don’t have any shares of stock,” or, “I, you know—I’m not all that much better than I was.”

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.469
So this is where he is strongest. 

00:47:35.469 --> 00:47:37.648
He knows he’s strongest. 

00:47:37.648 --> 00:47:42.548
And he can tweet, and he does the rallies, and he does what demagogues through history, 

00:47:42.548 --> 00:47:45.218
at least the last 120 years of history, have done. 

00:47:45.218 --> 00:47:52.299
He communicates directly, and he accuses the press of being “enemies of the people” 

00:47:52.299 --> 00:47:54.599
and The New York Times of being “treasonous.” 

00:47:54.599 --> 00:48:02.119
And he says, “Isn’t it great that we can circumvent all of the intermediaries, the media”—the word “media” 

00:48:02.119 --> 00:48:08.848
comes from “intermediary”—“we can circumvent all of them and I can talk to you truthfully”?

00:48:08.848 --> 00:48:14.776
And when his supporters and others hear Donald Trump, they don’t hear the lies. 

00:48:14.776 --> 00:48:21.242
What they hear is somebody who is giving them the unvarnished truth. 

00:48:21.242 --> 00:48:22.872
He’s not spinning. 

00:48:22.872 --> 00:48:25.064
He doesn’t sound like a politician. 

00:48:25.064 --> 00:48:27.720
In fact, he sounds like the opposite of a politician. 

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.342
He uses words that politicians don’t use. 

00:48:30.342 --> 00:48:32.390
He says things politicians don’t say. 

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:37.816
So to their ears, he sounds like it’s no bulls---.

00:48:37.816 --> 00:48:41.515
 Despite that their situation is not getting—is not really getting any better.

00:48:41.515 --> 00:48:50.436
 They are so willing to suspend disbelief in terms of their own situation not getting any better, 

00:48:50.436 --> 00:48:55.328
they’re willing to believe him because they want to shake things up. 

00:48:55.328 --> 00:49:01.569
What I heard over and over again in 2015, when I was going around the Midwest and Southern states and 

00:49:01.569 --> 00:49:09.453
swing states in 2015, was people said, and the same people told me: “I’m supporting Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump 

00:49:09.453 --> 00:49:11.848
because I want to shake things up. 

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:17.696
I think that politics and the establishment is just rotten to the core.”

00:49:17.696 --> 00:49:21.256
 … The 2018 elections and his—his bringing up the caravans and the use—

00:49:21.256 --> 00:49:25.240
the stoking of fear about what was taking place on the borders. 

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:31.976
And what did you—what did you see when that was being done, and what were the results?

00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:40.720
 Every time Donald Trump stokes up fear about caravans heading to the borders, about 

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:51.867
Mexican gangs and cartels, about workers flooding over into America or about black athletes who won’t 

00:49:51.867 --> 00:50:02.040
stand for the national anthem, or about congress—members of Congress, women who are of color, 

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:13.040
what he’s doing is saying to his base, mostly white, mostly rural, mostly older, mostly people who have not 

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:20.456
got to a position where they expected they would given that—what their parents did, he’s saying: “You know why? 

00:50:20.456 --> 00:50:24.338
It’s because of them, and I’m on your side; I’m not on their side.”

00:50:24.338 --> 00:50:32.360
“The elites,” he is saying, implicitly, “are on their side. 

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.008
They have given them an unfair break. 

00:50:37.008 --> 00:50:38.968
I am on your side.”

00:50:38.968 --> 00:50:42.804
 And Roy Moore, backing Roy Moore in that election? 

00:50:42.804 --> 00:50:47.201
What is—what statement is he making there? 

00:50:47.201 --> 00:50:55.264
What’s at stake, and why he goes down that route, which seems to be a dangerous political—?

00:50:55.264 --> 00:50:58.273
 The whole thing is a dangerous political route… 

00:50:58.273 --> 00:51:12.416
But as long as it works, as long as it stirs people up, as long as it distracts attention from the agenda that 

00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:19.116
the big corporations and the CEOs and Wall Street really want, which is tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and keep 

00:51:19.116 --> 00:51:24.768
the money rolling in, keep interest rates low so we can just do what we are doing, his financial backers 

00:51:24.768 --> 00:51:36.920
come out ahead, and his base is fired up, and all he needs is 11% more of the population to vote for him. 

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:42.876
 You look back at this last decade and the evolution of what has happened to both parties 

00:51:42.876 --> 00:51:53.880
and how more and more divided America has gotten, and I guess the question is how you see this decade, 

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:59.226
and sort of what are the lessons that we should be learning here?

00:51:59.226 --> 00:52:07.973
 I think the country faces a profound choice in the future, and it’s not a choice about Donald Trump per se. 

00:52:07.973 --> 00:52:17.124
It’s a choice about whether we make this system, and I’m talking about our economic and political system, work 

00:52:17.124 --> 00:52:29.542
for everyone who works hard and plays by what the rules are, or we continue down the road we’ve been on 

00:52:29.542 --> 00:52:34.482
since at least the late ’70s, early 1980s, when people at the top 

00:52:34.482 --> 00:52:41.590
were accumulating more and more wealth and power, which in turn gives them more wealth and power.

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.376
That’s the choice. 

00:52:43.376 --> 00:52:48.072
It’s not left or right as we have understood the terms. 

00:52:48.072 --> 00:52:53.536
It’s not Democrat versus Republican, as we traditionally have understood politics. 

00:52:53.536 --> 00:53:02.984
It is the majority, the vast majority, versus an emerging oligarchy who are not bad people, 

00:53:02.984 --> 00:53:10.355
and we’ve got to make sure we don’t vilify them because they’re doing what we would expect people to do. 

00:53:10.355 --> 00:53:16.568
They are simply using whatever means they have to aggregate additional power and wealth.

00:53:16.568 --> 00:53:25.723
But the entire system is off the tracks, and if we don’t understand that, and if we don’t understand 

00:53:25.723 --> 00:53:35.256
that that’s what’s led to the kind of anger we now have, we’re not going to solve the underlying problem.

00:53:35.256 --> 00:53:39.930
 And do you hear voices out there that understand that we’re off the tracks?

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:47.240
 I hear most voices out there saying we’re off the tracks. 

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.832
Most Americans believe the system is not working. 

00:53:51.832 --> 00:53:54.168
The polls show that. 

00:53:54.168 --> 00:53:58.832
My interviews with people all around the country confirm that. 

00:53:58.832 --> 00:54:03.416
The anger in our system demonstrates that. 

00:54:03.416 --> 00:54:06.788
The question is not is it understood. 

00:54:06.788 --> 00:54:11.600
The question is do we have the political will to do what we have to do, 

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.856
which is to change the allocation of power in society. 

00:54:16.856 --> 00:54:25.026
Nobody in the elites, and I’m talking about the establishment Republicans but also establishment Democrats, 

00:54:25.026 --> 00:54:31.240
wants to talk about power, but that is the discussion we must have.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:37.544
 And the core element of that, on the change of power, would be what?

00:54:37.544 --> 00:54:45.504
 The core element of that is to empower most Americans politically and economically. 

00:54:45.504 --> 00:54:55.560
Most people feel that they have no power; they have no agency; they have no control over their fates. 

00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:00.032
They feel like the people in power are up there and don’t give a damn. 

00:55:00.032 --> 00:55:04.616
And the problem is, most people are correct. 

00:55:04.616 --> 00:55:11.176
 … Is there any element or any event or anything that we haven’t talked about that you think is important to understand?

00:55:11.176 --> 00:55:18.312
 Well, I think it’s important to understand how central the 1990s were, 

00:55:18.312 --> 00:55:25.928
because Ronald Reagan came to office in 1980 as a protest candidate. 

00:55:25.928 --> 00:55:32.400
He certainly conveyed hope but also channeled anger. 

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.048
George H. W. Bush was his vice president, a continuation. 

00:55:36.048 --> 00:55:45.792
But in 1992 you had Ross Perot, the first candidate who really did say to America: 

00:55:45.792 --> 00:55:51.148
“I understand you feel like you’re getting a raw deal, and you know something? You are.

00:55:51.148 --> 00:55:54.256
The political parties are rotten.” 

00:55:54.256 --> 00:55:57.304
Ross Perot made it possible for Bill Clinton to win. 

00:55:57.304 --> 00:56:03.296
Bill Clinton didn’t understand what was happening. 

00:56:03.296 --> 00:56:11.224
In the 1990s, you had Rush Limbaugh become the biggest radio phenomenon in history, 

00:56:11.224 --> 00:56:20.843
spewing anger and vitriol and kind of ugliness and making fun of everybody, 

00:56:20.843 --> 00:56:27.400
but in a way that a lot of people began to say: “You know something? I like him. He’s right.” 

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:39.152
And then you had Roger Ailes create Fox News, and you had at the same time Newt Gingrich come to Washington with a gang of people. 

00:56:39.152 --> 00:56:42.900
He had already been in the Republican Party, but he took over the Republican Party 

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:48.328
with his own brand of anger and vitriol and ugliness. 

00:56:48.328 --> 00:57:00.557
He was channeling the same sense of betrayal, anti-establishment betrayal, that we saw flower years later 

00:57:00.557 --> 00:57:08.872
after the bank bailouts and the Tea Party movement, and even in the Occupy Movement, and even Bernie Sanders. 

00:57:08.872 --> 00:57:11.972
 All from very different, divergent points of view.

00:57:11.972 --> 00:57:19.272
 From very different points of view, but in terms of the underlying theme, 

00:57:19.272 --> 00:57:27.512
that the system is not working for most people and it’s being rigged, it’s the same idea. 

00:57:27.512 --> 00:57:28.412
It’s the same theme. 

00:57:28.412 --> 00:57:30.456
It’s the same emotion. 

00:57:30.456 --> 00:57:35.176
 So we’re all together in the end, but it’s all together in division.

00:57:35.176 --> 00:57:37.744
 Well, we’re all together in division, 

00:57:37.744 --> 00:57:44.192
but it’s not going to be impossible to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. 

00:57:44.192 --> 00:57:47.048
I am very optimistic. 

00:57:47.048 --> 00:57:54.564
I’m optimistic because I teach young people who are absolutely dedicated and committed 

00:57:54.564 --> 00:58:01.724
to making this country better, who don’t see color, who don’t see race the way my generation sees race, 

00:58:01.724 --> 00:58:09.208
who don’t have the same history, and who don’t have this kind of ugly, nationalistic stuff going on. 

00:58:09.208 --> 00:58:19.309
They really do consider themselves patriots in a positive way, and they are going to run the country.
