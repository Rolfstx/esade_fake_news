00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:02.918
It is almost the end of vacation season,

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:07.506
which is why I want to talk about
the fastest growing part of U.S. tourism.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.674
Cruises.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.551
The answer to the age-old question,

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:12.595
“What if porta-potties
had swimming pools?”

00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:15.222
Now, picking a vacation is hard.

00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:20.311
We all know we have to spend our money
on a lot of things: rent, car insurance,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.938
Popeye's chicken sandwiches,
important stuff,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.611
but vacations are the one time you get
to choose how you spend your money.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.072
That's why cruises are so appealing.

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:34.575
They're super convenient,
and they promise non-stop fun.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.161
“What started as another day in paradise,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.789
became the vacation of a lifetime.”

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.500
“There's so much to see
and do on the Disney Cruise.”

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.668
Sail away party!

00:00:46.587 --> 00:00:49.799
When you choose fun, it's like a party
you never want to stop starting.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.551
Bang for the buck?
You can't beat a Carnival Cruise.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:54.595
I'm Guy Fieri, and we're on Carnival.

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:57.264
I brought the entire family,
and we're having a blast.

00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.850
Okay, why does Guy Fieri's entire family

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.311
look like they're named Guy Fieri?

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:05.481
Also, where are the women?

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.069
Apparently, the entire Fieri family
is just dudes birthed from Alfredo sauce.

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:14.365
Now, you might be thinking, “Come on,
Hasan, aren't cruises an old people thing?

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:16.534
Like bingo and faith in our democracy.”

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:17.785
Not really.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.579
People of all ages love them,
and it makes sense.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.499
Everyone can do what they want.
Parents can drink,

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.378
teenagers can club, retirees can gamble,
and Muslims can...

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:31.549
We can eat. We can eat.
We can't eat everything...

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:33.509
but that's pretty much all we can do.

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:34.969
But they're affordable.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.180
Last year, a seven-day cruise
with full room and board

00:01:38.222 --> 00:01:40.141
cost about 1,500 bucks a person.

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:41.392
Now, here in New York,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.229
all that gets you is one ticket
to Blue Man Group, two soft pretzels,

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.438
and an UberPool home.

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:48.524
The perfect night for one.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.818
Now, cruises are a steal,

00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:53.654
and cruise companies love showing off
their new features.

00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:55.322
Facial recognition to speed up boarding

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:59.410
and geotracking so you can get a drink
brought to you anywhere on the ship.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.036
Every one of these boats

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:03.247
feels like it was designed
by drunk Walt Disney.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.373
Look at this shit.

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:06.375
He's just like, “Mickey...

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.754
Call Pluto
and just put everything on a ship.”

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.133
“Eighteen decks, 23 pools, 20 restaurants.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.678
Those purple tubes off the back
are a ten-story water slide.”

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.221
“A new feature at sea,

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.891
the first ever roller coaster
on a cruise ship.”

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.810
“The first at-sea go-kart track.”

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.645
“Outside skydive simulator.”

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:28.147
“Robotic bartenders.”

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:32.776
“More than 6,600 passengers,
2,200 crew.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:36.071
It's five times the size of the Titanic.”

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:39.491
You can't compare cruise ships
to the Titanic.

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:43.787
Like, a new power plant is never like,
“Good news, guys.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.540
We're five times the size of Chernobyl.”

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:52.421
Now, no matter what you're into,
there is a cruise for you.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.094
“The official World-Fan-Cruise
of David Hasselhoff.

00:02:59.386 --> 00:03:01.430
He'll be with you for the entire cruise.”

00:03:01.555 --> 00:03:04.808
“Cruise nude with
Bare Necessities Tour and Travel.”

00:03:04.892 --> 00:03:08.103
“The Church of Scientology's
Advanced Religious Retreat.

00:03:08.687 --> 00:03:10.022
The Freewinds.”

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.607
“Let me bring up our Captain,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.609
Captain Kid Rock!”

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:16.654
♪ Shit, goddamn, motherfucker, I'm back
Rock! ♪

00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:19.365
Kid Rock has a cruise.

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:22.451
It's like Captain Phillips,
but the pirates are the good guys.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.871
They show up, they're like,
“I'm the captain now.”

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.873
And everyone's like, “Thank God.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.834
Save us from this greasy scarecrow.”

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.088
But no matter which cruise you're taking,
there's a good chance

00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:36.757
it's on a ship owned by one
of three companies.

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:38.133
Carnival, 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.260
Royal Caribbean,

00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:40.803
or Norwegian Cruise Line.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:44.348
Between them,
they control more than 80% of the market,

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.935
a market that's worth almost $50 billion,

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:51.939
and that market is growing faster than
Marianne Williamson's crystal collection. Okay?

00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:56.277
By 2020, almost 30 million people
a year will be taking cruises.

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:57.194
30 million!

00:03:57.778 --> 00:04:00.531
That is 50 Wyomings
or a single bus in Mumbai.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.492
It's a lot of people.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.246
But, before you buy your tickets, there's a lot you
should probably know about cruises.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.748
First off,
it should not come as a surprise

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.126
that cruise ships aren't great
for the ocean.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.460
In the last 30 years,

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.881
the industry has been caught polluting
and dumping hundreds of times.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.467
They have paid over $100 million
in fines.

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:22.136
And that's just illegal dumping.

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:27.516
Legally, cruise ships are permitted
to dump food waste, cargo residue,

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:29.810
cleaning agents, and animal carcasses,

00:04:29.977 --> 00:04:33.397
which are also the four most popular
buffet items on the Kid Rock Cruise.

00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:36.233
Now let's just talk emissions, okay?

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:39.820
Moving a floating city burns a lot
of fuel, which is why, per passenger,

00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:43.782
cruise ships emit three
to four times more CO2 than jets,

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:45.993
and there's other kinds of pollution, too.

00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:48.370
Like the stuff that causes acid rain.

00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:51.790
“The world's largest cruise line
operator Carnival is reported

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:56.587
to be emitting nearly ten times more
sulfur dioxide around European coasts

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.841
than all the 260 million European cars.”

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:06.138
Carnival emits more sulfur dioxide
than all of Europe's cars.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.097
That's wild,

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.225
‘cause you know all
of those European cars smoke.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.271
They just sit around, they're like,
“I got to change my oil.”

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:17.816
One of them is like, “You know
I was in The Italian Job, right?”

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:24.865
And that's just one type of gas
from one cruise line on one continent.

00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:30.120
Now, look, a month ago, I totally wanted
to take my family on a cruise,

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:33.123
but this is the problem
with looking into things.

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:38.712
Like, when you actually do the research,
everything secretly sucks.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:42.257
And with cruises, it starts
with the fine print on your ticket.

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:43.717
Nobody ever reads the fine print.

00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:45.803
I'll give you guys an example, okay?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.597
When you accepted your ticket
here tonight,

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.393
you guys all agreed
to name your next child Vlade Divac.

00:05:53.268 --> 00:05:56.605
Congratulations,
your next baby is now Serbian.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.149
Cruise ticket language is just as absurd.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:03.987
Carnival says they can enter
and search your room anytime they want.

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:07.116
Royal Caribbean can lock you in your room

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:11.245
if you're “being detrimental
to the enjoyment of others.”

00:06:11.286 --> 00:06:12.955
They're like your parents, man.

00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:16.500
They can ground you, lock you in your room,
and go through your shit.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.836
And they're just like,
“Ugh! Sometimes, Kevin,

00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:22.089
I wonder if you're even my passenger.”

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:25.926
Meanwhile, Norwegian's fine print
straight-up sounds like

00:06:25.926 --> 00:06:27.594
it was written by Jack Sparrow.

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:32.975
They say they cannot be held liable
for damages resulting from revolution,

00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:38.647
rebellion, insurrection,
revolt of the crew, or perils of the sea.

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:40.816
What are perils of the sea?

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:45.195
Norwegian Cruise is just like,
“We are sailing to the edge of the world!

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:48.824
Who knows what foul beasts
we will encounter.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.035
Also, Nerf basketball closes at 11.”

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.372
These disclaimers all sound nuts.

00:06:55.747 --> 00:06:58.250
But the more you pull back the curtain
on the cruise industry,

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:00.627
an employee revolt sounds about right,

00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:03.130
because cruise passengers
are living large,

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:04.214
but crew members...

00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:05.924
not so much.

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:08.010
“It's all spelled out
in this damning report

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.720
from the Centers for Disease Control.

00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:13.265
‘Over fifteen full trolleys of food,

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:18.312
including milk, raw meats,
pasteurized eggs, cheeses of all types,

00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:24.109
all hidden in individual cabins shared
by two or three galley crew members

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:26.778
in order to avoid inspection.’”

00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:30.115
So it was you,
two other crew cabin members,

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.201
and a trolley full of salami.

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:35.704
-And two trolleys full of blue cheese.
-And blue cheese.

00:07:35.746 --> 00:07:39.291
Oh, my God, they are making their workers
live inside Lunchables.

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:42.753
Dude, someone cut him some air holes.

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:45.088
Now, many cruise employees say that
they can work

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.384
between 70 and 90 hours a week
with no overtime for months straight.

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:52.054
Making as little as 500 bucks a month,

00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:55.224
which comes out to $1.80 an hour.

00:07:56.016 --> 00:07:59.061
No job should pay less
than the Tooth Fairy, okay?

00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:02.523
Can you imagine going to payroll,
and they're like, “Okay, $1.80.

00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:04.358
Would you like that as direct deposit

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:05.776
or four coins?”

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:10.155
The entire industry is built
on these types of labor practices.

00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:12.491
This is an actual
Carnival recruiting video.

00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:16.537
Now, see if you can spot the parts
where they promise to abuse workers.

00:08:16.745 --> 00:08:19.957
“At Carnival,
there's always a ship ready for you.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.709
Are you compassionate and helpful?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.545
Do you learn quickly?

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:29.007
And can you keep up with the requirements
of a 24 hours a day,

00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:31.385
seven days a week operation,

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:34.513
consisting of an average workweek
of 70 hours?

00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:36.181
Are you punctual?”

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.142
Okay, how was punctual an option?

00:08:39.643 --> 00:08:42.271
You can't be late if you're working
24 hours a day.

00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:46.316
Now, you might be wondering,
“Who is working these terrible jobs?”

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.486
Well,
let's ask the CEO of Royal Caribbean.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.157
We already have more Filipino seafarers
than any other nationality.

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:59.955
And they provide a tremendous level
of service, our guests love them.

00:09:00.455 --> 00:09:03.417
And the other thing is,
they seem to love us.

00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:04.626
Nah, they probably don't.

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:08.088
That's the same kind of guy that thinks
strippers are really into him.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.842
He's like, “I know it's crazy,
but I felt a connection with Chardonnay.

00:09:12.634 --> 00:09:14.553
And I think she felt it, too.”

00:09:16.054 --> 00:09:16.888
Now, look.

00:09:17.055 --> 00:09:21.018
Almost a third of all cruise employees
are Filipino.

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:23.854
Cruise lines love hiring Filipino workers.

00:09:23.854 --> 00:09:27.566
That's because the Filipino government
bars its citizens working on ships

00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:31.403
from taking nearly all legal action
against a foreign company.

00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:33.447
This process is complicated,

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:35.240
but here's basically
what ends up happening.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.535
If a worker gets hurt, right,
the Filipino government

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:42.873
forces them to accept a low payment based
on which body part is injured.

00:09:42.914 --> 00:09:44.249
So these are real numbers.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.961
If a Filipino cruise employee
loses his ear,

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:51.298
he can get up to $5,225.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.051
A ring finger is $3,000.

00:09:54.092 --> 00:09:56.928
And if you paralyze both legs,
that's $60 grand.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:59.598
And look, I know everybody's wondering...

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:02.976
I can see it in your eyes.

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:07.648
How much is the penis?
I want to ask you guys

00:10:08.065 --> 00:10:11.360
the same question
philosophers have pondered for millennia.

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:13.779
What is the value of dick?

00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:17.324
How much is that dick worth?

00:10:17.324 --> 00:10:20.243
Now, guys,
don't just throw out a random number.

00:10:20.327 --> 00:10:22.579
We're gonna use Price Is Right rules,
all right?

00:10:23.413 --> 00:10:24.456
How much is a dick?

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:26.792
500K.

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:27.918
Half a mil.

00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:30.962
Okay.

00:10:33.256 --> 00:10:34.424
How much is a dick?

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:37.010
-Maybe 25,000.
-Maybe 25.

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:39.721
All right, we got a big disparity here.

00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:41.348
A penis is worth...

00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:44.559
$20,900.

00:10:46.978 --> 00:10:51.858
See, that's humbling.
A dick is worth a 2017 Ford Fiesta.

00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:56.905
So workers face low wages, brutal hours,
disgusting working conditions,

00:10:56.988 --> 00:11:00.033
and often have little recourse,
and it's all legal,

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:02.744
because of this one bizarre subset of law.

00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:04.079
It's called maritime law.

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:07.916
It lets cruise lines play by
a completely different set of rules.

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:11.670
And it's how the high seas
become the Wild West.

00:11:12.003 --> 00:11:14.464
“Companies register most
of their ships

00:11:14.464 --> 00:11:16.633
in small countries across the globe.

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:19.511
And because the companies
fly those foreign flags,

00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:23.265
they don't have to abide
by strict U.S. regulations,

00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:28.395
even though they operate out of U.S. ports
and carry mainly U.S. passengers.” 

00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:30.439
They're kind of in a world of their own.

00:11:31.106 --> 00:11:32.983
And when you're in a world of your own,

00:11:33.483 --> 00:11:36.820
you can do what you want,
and that's exactly what they do.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.071
I take his point.

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:40.574
Thought it's weird
to hear a Rockefeller complain about

00:11:40.615 --> 00:11:42.409
people living in a world of their own.

00:11:43.326 --> 00:11:44.953
Dude, you have your own plaza.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.039
Now, cruises get away
with exploiting their workers

00:11:48.081 --> 00:11:51.918
because of a maritime law called
flying a “flag of convenience.”

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:54.629
The same way you have to register your car
in a state,

00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:57.799
cruise lines have to register their ships
in a country.

00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:01.553
But they get to pick which country
and as a bonus,

00:12:01.845 --> 00:12:05.348
they get to follow
that country's tax laws, labor laws,

00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:06.892
and safety regulations.

00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:11.938
So even though Carnival, Royal Caribbean,
and Norwegian have headquarters in Miami,

00:12:12.522 --> 00:12:14.900
Carnival ships are registered in Panama.

00:12:15.233 --> 00:12:18.570
Royal Caribbean and Norwegian ships
are registered in the Bahamas.

00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:22.699
That's right.
A cruise line named after Norway

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.661
operates ships from the Bahamas
with headquarters in Florida.

00:12:26.828 --> 00:12:29.122
It is the Rachel Dolezal of companies.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.375
They're like,
“Yes, I'm technically from the Bahamas,

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:35.504
but I identify
as a Norwegian from Florida.

00:12:35.545 --> 00:12:38.048
Also as you can see, I'm black.”

00:12:38.131 --> 00:12:41.802
Now, about 90% of commercial ships

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:45.847
that sail in and out of the U.S.
fly foreign flags.

00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:50.018
It saves cruise lines billions in wages
and taxes.

00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:54.356
In the last three years, Carnival made
almost $9 billion in income,

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:57.108
but paid less than 2% in taxes.

00:12:57.651 --> 00:13:00.654
Remember, their executives are in Miami.

00:13:00.737 --> 00:13:03.448
They make all of their decisions
out of Miami,

00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:08.203
but somehow legally,
their company is “in Panama.”

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:11.581
Each boat is basically
a floating Swiss bank account,

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:13.500
and Shaq is their CFO.

00:13:14.918 --> 00:13:17.504
Flags of convenience also hurt passengers,

00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:19.422
especially when it comes to crime.

00:13:19.714 --> 00:13:23.635
Now, let's say you're on a Carnival ship
that leaves from Miami, Florida.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:27.472
For the first nine miles,
you're still technically in Florida.

00:13:27.722 --> 00:13:30.225
So, if someone steals your signed copy
of If I Did It,

00:13:30.308 --> 00:13:32.686
Florida is responsible
for dealing with it.

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:36.356
That's already bad. From nine to twelve miles,
you're in federal waters,

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.775
which means it's under FBI's jurisdiction.

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:42.195
Twelve miles out,
you enter international waters,

00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:44.447
but since you're
on a Panamanian-flagged ship,

00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:46.783
you're legally in Panama.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.619
This is all so confusing.

00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:53.331
Which means a lot of crime at sea
goes unpunished.

00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:55.542
A  man came and grabbed me by the hair

00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:58.587
and beat my head against the wall
until I became unconscious.

00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:01.381
“She reported it to the onboard security

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:04.551
and to police
when she docked in Puerto Rico.”

00:14:04.634 --> 00:14:06.678
By the time we were through,

00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:11.474
having the police explain to me
that they had no jurisdiction,

00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:13.518
they'd already let this man off the ship.

00:14:13.977 --> 00:14:18.106
So according to all crime statistics
for that ship, no crime ever occurred.

00:14:18.398 --> 00:14:22.068
I mean, if this had happened at a 7-Eleven,
this man would have been arrested.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.155
Okay, you know things are bad
when your gold standard for law and order

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.364
is a 7-Eleven.

00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:29.576
Getting away with a crime on a cruise
is easier

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:32.704
because of how maritime law
handles crime reporting.

00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:35.707
Now, it's never been great,
but for nearly a century,

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:40.962
cruises weren't legally required
to report any crimes to anyone.

00:14:41.087 --> 00:14:43.798
Then in 2010, President Obama signed a law

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:46.676
called the Cruise Vessel Security
and Safety Act.

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:49.179
It improved a ton
of different safety measures

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.139
and said that for the first time

00:14:51.222 --> 00:14:54.935
that if any
of these serious crimes occurred,

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.978
the ship had to report them to the FBI.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.814
Now, homicide, I get.

00:15:00.857 --> 00:15:01.983
But then after that,

00:15:02.025 --> 00:15:05.737
they only have to report
“suspicious deaths.”

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.448
Here's what that means, all right?

00:15:08.448 --> 00:15:11.993
If a death happens on the ship
and it's not suspicious,

00:15:12.535 --> 00:15:15.413
they don't have to say anything
to the FBI.

00:15:15.455 --> 00:15:16.831
So hypothetically...

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:22.003
say Grandpa fell off the lido deck,
is he just clumsy

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:24.673
or did he piss off Grandma?

00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:28.468
Look. Now, she's was laughing
and holding a martini the whole time,

00:15:29.177 --> 00:15:30.553
but I would call that suspicious,

00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:33.431
but if the cruise line doesn't want
to deal with it,

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.684
they can call it whatever they want.

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:36.977
That's the whole game.

00:15:37.602 --> 00:15:40.021
Suspicious is in the eye of the beholder.

00:15:40.063 --> 00:15:42.816
Like, look at this house.
Does it look suspicious?

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.236
Well it should
‘cause that's Ted Bundy's house, okay?

00:15:47.487 --> 00:15:49.030
Suspicious deaths...

00:15:49.489 --> 00:15:51.324
aren't the biggest concern
on cruise ships.

00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:53.618
That's really Ted Bundy's house.
We had to pull that image.

00:15:54.494 --> 00:15:58.081
Okay, but assaults on cruise ships,
those are a different story.

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:01.042
And this is when semantics
gets really serious.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:04.546
Sexual assault is the most common crime
committed on board,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.632
and over a third of those victims
are minors.

00:16:08.216 --> 00:16:11.386
And that's a huge problem
that Obama's law failed to fix.

00:16:12.053 --> 00:16:14.055
Because it is still the cruise line's job

00:16:14.097 --> 00:16:17.934
to determine which assaults need
to be reported to the FBI.

00:16:18.184 --> 00:16:21.062
So they could call, say, sexual assault...

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.941
“groping” or “inappropriate touching.”

00:16:25.692 --> 00:16:28.820
And then, they never have to tell
the FBI about it.

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:32.449
“Abby says she was sexually
assaulted by an instructor in the gym

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.867
on a Carnival Cruise.

00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:37.037
And because of conflicting information
and lack of evidence,

00:16:37.078 --> 00:16:39.164
no criminal charges were filed.

00:16:39.205 --> 00:16:41.916
But Carnival acknowledged
that something did happen.

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:45.211
In email sent to the Smiths,
‘Our heartfelt apologies

00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:46.921
for the unfortunate incident.’

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:49.090
Carnival also offered them a refund,

00:16:49.132 --> 00:16:53.053
a complimentary cruise,
and to pay for counseling for Abby.”

00:16:53.136 --> 00:16:54.763
She doesn't want a free cruise!

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:58.308
They're like, “You know what'll help you
through this trauma?

00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:00.101
Seven days at the scene of the crime.”

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:05.148
These shady reporting tactics
protect the cruise lines,

00:17:05.565 --> 00:17:09.319
but nothing protects them more
than the mother of all maritime laws,

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:12.530
DOHSA, which stands
for Death on the High Seas Act.

00:17:12.572 --> 00:17:15.700
A law that goes back
almost a hundred years.

00:17:15.825 --> 00:17:17.869
“The 1920 Death on the High Seas Act

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:22.540
is a U.S. law that allows survivors’
family members to sue a cruise line.

00:17:22.582 --> 00:17:25.168
But damages in the case of death
are limited.”

00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:28.129
“The cruise is only responsible
for actual expenses

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.381
and any dependent beneficiaries.”

00:17:30.548 --> 00:17:33.718
Actual expenses means the cost
of the funeral.

00:17:33.968 --> 00:17:38.306
Independent beneficiaries means
you can recover only what the dead person

00:17:38.389 --> 00:17:41.684
would have earned
over their expected lifetime.

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:43.978
So to put it another way...

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:47.690
If you're a minor or a retired couple,

00:17:47.982 --> 00:17:52.946
the Death on the High Seas Act
says your life has no economic value.

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:54.864
“Your life has no economic value”

00:17:54.906 --> 00:17:57.033
sounds like how Jeff Bezos negs women.

00:17:58.743 --> 00:18:01.246
Now, I bet you're wondering

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:05.125
do that many people really die
on cruise ships?

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:08.461
There are no cameras in most cases
on most cruise ships

00:18:08.503 --> 00:18:10.672
that record what happens on the balcony.

00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:13.800
It's a perfect place to commit a crime,
to assault someone

00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:16.553
and to throw them overboard.
Most people get away with it.

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:18.680
Hey, CNN. Don't just spell it out, man.

00:18:19.514 --> 00:18:21.683
They're like, “Hey, murderers.
Want to get away with it?

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:22.684
Do it on a boat.”

00:18:23.518 --> 00:18:27.605
Now, to be fair, not that many people
get murdered on cruise ships.

00:18:28.523 --> 00:18:29.983
But unfortunately...

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:33.486
one kind of death is way more common
than it should be.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.447
The coast guard is investigating
the drowning death of a ten-year-old girl

00:18:36.447 --> 00:18:38.241
in a cruise ship swimming pool.

00:18:38.449 --> 00:18:40.910
Last year, a four-year-old boy died
in a swimming pool

00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:43.288
of another Norwegian Cruise Line ship.

00:18:43.454 --> 00:18:45.915
“Since then, there have been
at least eight lawsuits

00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:50.044
where kids drowned in cruise ship pools
and three more near-drownings.”

00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:51.421
This is devastating.

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:55.008
And you may be wondering,
“Hasan, where was the lifeguard?”

00:18:55.049 --> 00:19:00.013
You have a floating city at sea
with maybe six or seven different pools

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:01.598
and no lifeguards on duty.

00:19:01.764 --> 00:19:04.100
Why don't these cruise lines
just add lifeguards?

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.101
It's all about money for them.

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.811
Because, there's such a small amount
of space on the ships, 

00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:09.022
they can either have a crew member
or a passenger on board.

00:19:09.105 --> 00:19:11.232
They always want the passenger ‘cause
the passengers are spending money.

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:12.692
Okay, you have to understand,

00:19:13.234 --> 00:19:17.322
Royal Caribbean and Norwegian
only started putting lifeguards on boats

00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:18.740
two years ago.

00:19:19.365 --> 00:19:22.535
And Carnival,
the biggest company of them all,

00:19:22.577 --> 00:19:24.829
still doesn't have lifeguards.

00:19:25.663 --> 00:19:26.998
How is that even possible?

00:19:27.707 --> 00:19:30.627
They have swimming pools,
hot tubs, water parks,

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:33.087
thousands of child passengers,

00:19:33.296 --> 00:19:36.633
and everyone at Carnival is like,
“Guys, are we missing something?”

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:41.638
And a guy's like, “Roller coasters!”

00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:44.098
“Bob...

00:19:44.724 --> 00:19:46.768
you are a lifesaver.”

00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:48.394
Now, for years,

00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:51.648
victims' families have tried
to get Congress to change DOHSA.

00:19:51.648 --> 00:19:54.400
In 2010, they tried to pass new rules

00:19:54.442 --> 00:19:58.529
so that families could sue for damages due
to negligence,

00:19:58.571 --> 00:20:02.283
but cruise lines spent millions
fighting it, and it went nowhere.

00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:06.496
Then in 2017, Congress tried to pass
another bill to do the same thing,

00:20:06.621 --> 00:20:09.624
but it died in committee
because the cruise lines know

00:20:10.124 --> 00:20:13.253
that if their passengers
could actually hold them accountable,

00:20:13.544 --> 00:20:14.837
it would cost them millions,

00:20:14.879 --> 00:20:17.173
which they can't afford
because we all know...

00:20:18.132 --> 00:20:20.301
They're just a poor Panamanian operation.

00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:22.178
Now, look...

00:20:22.595 --> 00:20:24.305
I understand if you love cruises.

00:20:24.347 --> 00:20:26.891
What other business could get
Leonardo DiCaprio

00:20:26.933 --> 00:20:28.476
to date someone his own age?

00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:33.523
But you should know the price
of a cruise is not 1,500 bucks.

00:20:34.065 --> 00:20:36.025
The real cost is shitty air,

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:39.028
poisoned water, piles of garbage,

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:43.116
lost tax revenue, worker abuse,
climate change, unreported crime,

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:46.577
and preventable deaths,
and if that's still worth it to you,

00:20:47.203 --> 00:20:50.915
then at the very least, please watch
this informative safety video.

00:20:55.461 --> 00:20:56.462
Welcome aboard!

00:20:56.796 --> 00:20:59.173
As you set out
on your luxury cruise vacation,

00:20:59.382 --> 00:21:02.010
here's a few important tips
that the cruise companies

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.177
may forget to tell you.

00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:07.015
Please switch your find my phone setting
to “on.”

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.810
That way, if you're accidentally
shoved overboard by an angry spouse,

00:21:10.893 --> 00:21:13.396
the Panamanian police might be able
to find you.

00:21:13.604 --> 00:21:16.274
Please bring plenty of cash
for tipping the staff

00:21:16.357 --> 00:21:18.651
because your server
at Guy Fieri's Burger Joint

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:21.738
will also be the person
performing your emergency tracheotomy.

00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:24.198
-Your breakfast, Captain.
-Not now, Ernesto!

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:28.494
You'll want to memorize the phone number
for the FBI

00:21:28.536 --> 00:21:30.621
in case you're the victim
of a serious crime.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.833
Otherwise, we'll need to figure out
how far you are from shore,

00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:37.378
where your ship is flagged
and how to reach that country's cops.

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:42.175
Also, some passengers may occasionally
experience getting stabbed.

00:21:42.633 --> 00:21:44.552
If you are getting stabbed,

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:46.888
ask your attacker
to make it look suspicious.

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.766
Otherwise, no one will ever know about it.

00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:56.147
And finally, try to avoid the following:

00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:08.409
-He's not gonna like that.
-I wouldn't, either.

00:22:09.118 --> 00:22:10.286
Bon voyage!
