00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.730
If you've ever heard Bernie Sanders speak, this
probably sounds familiar.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.700
Now is the time for a political revolution!

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.680
Political revolution!

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.400
Political,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.280
revolution!

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.320
He talks a lot about big change.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.769
Political revolution.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.780
But recently, I found some old footage of
Bernie Sanders

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.340
that I didn’t really know what to make of.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.740
I came across some archival tape of his cable
access program

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.940
that he ran when he was mayor of Burlington.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.080
Here, I'll just play it for you.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000
Also, our library.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We have a beautiful library.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.260
When I look at this tape, I see him talking
about extremely boring things.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.900
A lot of people don’t realize that Bernie
Sanders is a veteran politician,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.220
veteran elected official.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.020
He has always maintained this dual-track view,
these very high aspirations, very ideological…

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.900
Political revolution which is going to transform
America.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.009
with the idea that day to day you need to
be a competent politician who does things.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.840
Burlington will soon have a beautiful downtown
supermarket.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.760
Most political journalism, whether it's pro-Bernie
or anti-Bernie, tends to focus on that first track,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.160
the ideology.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.780
Bernie Sanders’ platform is really pie in
the sky.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500
An ideologue without a lot of substance.
He is really trying to inspire people to be

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.970
involved in what he calls a movement more
than a campaign.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.500
But the best way to predict how someone will
act in the future, is to look what they’ve allready done.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.259
Bernie Sanders has a record.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.700
So, what does it tell us about what kind of
president he'd make,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.460
and his odds of getting there in the first place?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.280
A lot of the time when you see people make
the case for Sanders, they just talk about

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.619
those big ideas.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.320
...complete change of politics in America.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.900
...a revolution of spirit, a revolution of priorities.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.060
Some people love those big ideas, but
others don’t.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.050
And what I said to them is, look at when
he was a mayor.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.020
He didn't try to abolish private businesses
in the city.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.300
He tried to make the tax code more progressive
and he tried to provide more services.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.800
He is aware of how to operate in these kinds
of spaces.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.280
The gentleman from Vermont is recognized for five
minutes.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.960
When Bernie Sanders has to cast votes not
in perfect alignment

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.460
with what he says his principles are…

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.160
What happens in those situations?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.680
There are three kinds of Bernie Sanders votes
in Congress.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.460
One is the sort of courageous dissent.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.590
The invasion of Iraq, that's going to pass.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.720
He takes a stand against it.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.580
I will vote against the unilateral invasion
and occupation of Iraq.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.780
The other is the kind of big legislative package
that everybody agrees to.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.210
And some members, Bernie among them, often
cast dissenting votes there just to say, no,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.040
I want to hold out for my pure vision.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.320
But then there's the third kind.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.250
There's a progressive bill where Democrats
need his vote for it to pass.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.600
And it may not align with exactly all of his
principles.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.020
You look at the Affordable Care Act.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.940
Mr. Sanders, aye.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.660
The stimulus at the beginning of the Obama administration.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.520
Mr. Sanders, aye

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.480
Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform.
A bill, in which in a number of ways moves us forward.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.100
If there were 80 Bernie Sanders’ in the
Senate, he probably would've passed a different bill.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.200
But he's not blind to the fact that incremental
progress is real progress.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.260
One area that I don’t hear a lot about in
the primary is foreign policy.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.540
Where does Bernie stand in terms of America's
role in the world?

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.020
Sanders has a distinctive approach to foreign
policy from the other candidates in the field.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.640
He's been critical, not just of the specifics,
but of the sort of nature of American military

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.880
posture around the world.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.220
No more B-2 bombers, no more "Star Wars."
Let’s make the quality products we need.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.530
Let’s invest in American industry.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.810
No, I won't yield.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.740
For years, we have loved Saudi Arabia, our
wonderful ally.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.050
The only problem is that the people that run
that country are murderous thugs.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.200
He has raised, I think, sharp and necessary
questions about the nature of the U.S. alliance

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.230
with Israel, with Saudi Arabia.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.400
Donald Trump and Barack Obama have both spoken
about their desire to not be mired in so many

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.010
Middle Eastern wars, but they haven't taken
the kind of tough steps that would actually

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.510
generate change there.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.740
And I think Sanders might.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.640
So thinking about a potential match-up between
Bernie and Trump in the general election.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.080
What's the affirmative case for Bernie in
that situation?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.540
If you look at the numbers from 2016.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.150
Not only did Trump lose the popular vote,
but he got only 46 percent.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.700
If you could unify all the non-Republicans.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.040
So the libertarian voters, the Green voters
and the Democrats, you would beat Trump and

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.290
you would beat him easily.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.160
And Bernie has a track record of doing that
kind of thing.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.960
Bernie is sometimes felt by Democrats to be
a divisive force in the party.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.920
But I think another way of looking at it is
that Bernie speaks for people who are not

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.880
necessarily into the Democratic Party.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.400
If you combine people who love the Democratic
Party, people who, you know, post Nancy Pelosi memes,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.140
with Bernie's people.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.280
Then, you have a unified anti-Trump force.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.210
Bernie is beating Trump in the key swing states.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.800
We know these are places in the upper Midwest
where NAFTA is unpopular.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.240
I happen to believe that our trade policies
over the years have been a disaster for workers

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.240
in this country.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.940
Bernie is somebody who sometimes attracts
complaints for privileging economics over

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.980
other things.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.680
But I do think that that's a winning electoral
strategy.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.100
One of the things that Mayor Pete, for example,
and Biden too, talk a lot about is this sort

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.960
of like sense of a return to unity and hope.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.100
I refuse to accept the notion that we can
never have cooperation again.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.720
We have been told by some that you must either
be for a revolution or you are for the status quo.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.880
I think Sanders’ is view on this, which
I think is correct, is that politics is a

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.670
location of struggle.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.330
None of these Democratic candidates are going
to be able to fully deliver on all their promises.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.380
There are going to have to be deals made,
compromises made.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.660
That's the political process, but you need
to be able to bring people along with you.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.820
And the question is...

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.060
And that's something that I think Sanders
is going to be able to do.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.120
He has this slogan,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.020
And that, you know, is in part about like,how
does politics work?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.120
Nobody is so amazing that if everybody then
just walks away that all these problems are

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.300
going to be solved.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.640
What we need as a society is a politically
engaged populace.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.340
We don't know, if Bernie brings a bunch
of his younger supporters into the electoral process,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.560
he boosts youth turnout.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.800
Will that effect last?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.990
But it's guaranteed not to work if you don't
try.
