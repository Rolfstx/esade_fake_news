00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.220
MICHAEL KIRK - When do you know it’s the
Russians spying around the DNC [Democratic

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.480
National Committee] hack and around the [Clinton
campaign chair John] Podesta hack?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.369
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I think we know in the
summer 2016.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:25.640
But what we know traces—but we don’t really
know who or where.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.970
There are little fingerprints and traces.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.910
The report that CrowdStrike did looking into
those DNC servers found software patterns

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.190
that match patterns of malware they’d seen
elsewhere.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.470
It’s sort of a puzzle; it’s a detective
game, trying to say, “Well, this matches

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.510
that,” or, “This thing has some Cyrillic
letters in it.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.650
Where did it come from?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.170
Which IP address?”

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.610
But there's some assumptions in this kind
of work, like all detective work.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.189
MICHAEL KIRK - Once it seems to be clear that
it might be Russia, what are you saying to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.420
yourself about the likelihood of it being
something initiated by Vladimir Putin?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.429
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Putin spent his entire
career in an institution that used deception

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:31.590
and subversion as tools of the state, and
he spent 17 years studying those methods before

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.109
he came into the political arena and left
that behind.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.420
But he didn't leave behind those lessons.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.920
I think a lot of what we've seen about Putin
in real warfare in Chechnya and Ukraine and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.250
information warfare and in cyberwarfare, in
almost every form, Putin knows that he is

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.759
the head of a state that's weak.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.829
By his own statements, he took over a state
that was nearly broken.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.340
If you think about where he’s coming from
to try and assert strength, it isn't possible

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.860
to compete with huge, rich countries in the
world.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.230
He doesn't have the resources, so he’s got
to think about ways to leverage his weakness.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.629
He's got to think about ways to appear to
be stronger using asymmetric methods, and

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.400
cyber is one of those asymmetric methods.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.010
It is something that does not require massive
resources of a state.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.870
In many ways, the expertise can be private
hackers.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.569
I think a lot of what I thought about when
this first started to crest was that this

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.210
is the perfect asymmetric weapon, information.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.409
MICHAEL KIRK - So you’ve given us the entrée.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.420
It's the end of the Soviet Union.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.599
It’s—the Wall is down; he’s in Dresden.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.190
Who is that man?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.299
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - This time period, 1989,
1990, to understand it, you really have to

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.180
understand the enormous empire that was cracking
up all around him.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.280
This empire was artifice.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.379
It was a lot of things that in the Russian
imperial history had been conquered and added

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.360
on and then solidified.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.940
The Soviet Union was really an enormous agglomeration
of nationalities, some of which were breaking

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.380
off of the Warsaw Pact, of captive nations
in Eastern Europe that were restive.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.379
When this whole thing, the bonds of it start
to loosen largely because of the efforts of

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.700
Mikhail Gorbachev, and Gorbachev starts a
revolution from above, he essentially encourages

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.540
people to see him as a moment in which the
totalitarian system is ending and he's giving

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.700
people freedoms, maybe not complete freedom,
but Gorbachev is an essential player here,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.930
even in Germany.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:12.141
In 1989, when Gorbachev came to East Germany,
where Vladimir Putin was in Dresden, Gorbachev

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:17.850
came, and he walked a sort of standard party
parade.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.150
It was a big day, and the crowds were out,
and the Communist Youth League kids were in

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.350
the stands.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.920
Gorbachev is parading with the leader of Eastern
Europe, and as he passes the stands, the young

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.660
kids say, “Mikhail Sergeyevich, help us.”

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.510
Gorbachev is essentially unleashing the bonds,
and if you give people a little bit of freedom,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.760
they take it.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.150
And people were taking more and more freedom.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.630
First of all, in the Eastern European countries,
they were all basically told, the leaders

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.690
were told, part of the Warsaw Pact, were all
told: “Go your own way.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.350
You guys are on your own.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.010
Moscow is not coming this time.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.730
There won't be another Soviet invasion like
the Prague Spring.”

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.070
You have to understand—this is critically
important—that the Prague Spring in 1968,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.040
the Soviet invasion, was a thing that left
a deep impression on Gorbachev, because about

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.360
a year afterward, after the Soviet tanks had
rolled in, Gorbachev was sent as a young party

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.420
official to Prague as part of a goodwill mission.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:40.041
He went to a factory there, and instead of
seeing a lot of smiling Czech workers, or

00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:46.480
even a Potemkin village of workers, the workers
in this factory turned their backs on the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.640
visiting Soviet delegation, on Mikhail Gorbachev.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.030
And when he saw that, he realized there was
no way the Soviet Union could hold this whole

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.780
thing together, that the use of force was
futile.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.620
Taking that lesson into 1989, Gorbachev was
a force for a lot of the places, including

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.880
in Germany, in East Germany, for people to
begin to taste and smell and think about freedom.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.330
It didn't only sit in Moscow where, of course,
the center of Gorbachev's reforms were unfolding;

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.610
it flooded the entire empire.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:32.900
So Vladimir Putin is a junior officer in the
KGB in Dresden, which Dresden’s big claim

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.140
to fame was that it had the one sort of high-tech
factory in the Eastern bloc.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.560
Robotron was in Dresden, and it was not really
nearly as high-tech as the factories in the

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.140
West, but they made some integrated circuits
and some computers and so on.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:55.670
But Dresden wasn’t even really the center
of anything, and it was a backwater assignment.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:03.830
He was one of a couple of KGB officers in
a small rezidentura in Dresden, and probably

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.140
what his activities were every day, day to
day there, was not very exciting.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.020
This is not James Bond.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.420
This is administrative work.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.580
If a professor from East Germany was maybe
making a trip into the West, you had to brief

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.530
him and tell him what to look for, especially
if somebody was traveling and going near a

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.980
NATO base or a place of interest, what to
look for, what kinds of things to bring back.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.040
Somebody needed maybe a phony driver’s license
or a disguise.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.420
But it was still administrative work.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:45.320
And this little office that Putin worked in
in this sort of backwater place was right

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.780
by the bigger headquarters of the East German
secret police, the Stasi.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.440
He could even see from his little window that
the Stasi guys in their own place and time

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.050
lived bigger and better than he did.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:06.400
I think that this was, certainly for a guy
like Putin, who had always wanted to work

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.590
in the KGB and was accepted and trained as
an officer and then sent aboard, it probably

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:19.900
was not stimulating every day to have to run
these minor agents and do all this administrative

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.430
work in a kind of dreary East German backwater.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:34.650
The KGB's mission was to protect this great
empire, this great party state that Putin

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.710
worked for.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.930
Certainly in his lifetime, he had been trained
and come to believe that the Soviet Union

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.500
was a superpower, a global power, a respected
power around the world.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.620
There was a Cold War confrontation.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.010
For whatever you can say about the Soviet
Union, it was half of that confrontation,

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:59.050
and it was a very, very big, powerful country
that had enormous impact on that second half

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.550
of that century.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:07.930
And by 1989 and 1990, Putin sees that this
thing that had always seemed to be glued together

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:13.620
well, seemed to be impervious, that had gone
from generation to generation of change in

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:20.270
the top party officials, seemed to be a rock,
it was starting to crumble before his eyes.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.650
And this crumbling was not something that
he was part of.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:28.740
It was happening, starting, with that guy
Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow who was loosening

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.840
the reins, who was telling people: “You
can vote.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.710
We can have some democracy.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.050
We can have some socialism and democracy.”

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.190
Gorbachev was letting this happen.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:43.840
And by the way, in Moscow and in the Soviet
Union, this was a life-changing event for

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.520
the people who lived through it.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:52.160
For the adults and even young people who were
part of those glasnost and perestroika years,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.450
this was something that was completely different
in their entire lives, and in many, many ways

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:05.350
was just a revolution beyond expectations
that, for example, the press which had been

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:12.300
so stilted in communist times suddenly becomes
partially free and in some cases almost completely

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.300
free.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.070
And people would line up to read newspapers.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.360
They had never paid them much attention before.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:25.430
Similarly, people began to discover that long-held
dark secrets of their history, that the state

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:31.190
had never let out, were suddenly coming out,
including the truth about the Stalin-Hitler

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:38.300
pact of World War II, which had been kept
a secret for many, many years until Gorbachev's

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.570
time inside the Soviet Union.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:46.640
So for many people, this was a time of great
excitement and enablement and experimentation

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.210
with democracy.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:54.990
Probably the peak of this, the zenith of it,
came when Gorbachev permitted limited free

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.590
elections for the new parliament, the Congress
of People’s Deputies.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:04.300
This was a moment in which people were not
voting in some kind of pro forma election

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.740
where every party member raised their hand
yes, but where people actually had choices

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.490
and where they actually chose who they thought
would be the best candidates.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:19.590
When this parliament then convened with Andrei
Sakharov, the great physicist and human rights

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:25.850
advocate and dissident elected to the parliament,
the entire country stopped for a day.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.020
People stopped working.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:34.320
They stood in front of their televisions mesmerized
by this limited freedom that was on display.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.780
MICHAEL KIRK - But our guy Putin sitting in
Dresden misses it all.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.840
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Vladimir Putin missed this.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.450
Vladimir Putin missed this wave of excitement.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.710
He missed this life-transformation—years
[of it]—the years that this happened he

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.650
was in East Germany, and he was watching it
from afar.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.280
He was not part of it.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.490
He didn't really believe in it; he didn't
subscribe to these ideas.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:03.040
And it all happened far away until it finally
reached him when the Wall came down.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.720
The year after the Wall came down, he returned
in 1990 to a Soviet Union that was spinning

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.370
apart.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.080
That winter of 1990 was probably the worst.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.690
The shortages were horrible; there were really
bad bread shortages.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:26.220
Even, I recall, one of those winters, a huge
convoy of coal train cars froze, just froze,

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.529
and they couldn’t get the coal to the heating
plants.

00:12:29.529 --> 00:12:32.040
Everything seemed to be going wrong in that
winter.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.330
Of course Gorbachev at that time had forsaken
some of his earlier hopes for democracy and

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.050
was trying to tack back to authoritarianism.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.110
It wasn't working.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.160
Everything was in a sort of suspended state
of great uncertainty.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:53.100
And the Soviet Union that Vladimir Putin came
back to in 1990 was no more within a year.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.260
MICHAEL KIRK - ... We heard there were 800,000
KGB officers at the end of the Soviet Union.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.310
Let’s take it back.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:05.420
As a little boy, the way the story goes, at
16 he walks in and tries to volunteer into

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.510
the KGB.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:13.330
Take me on that young-man trajectory and how
the preparation to be a KGB officer might

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.720
yield the Vladimir Putin who becomes president.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.720
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Putin was only—I don’t
want to say only child.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:25.250
He had a brother who died before he was born.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.779
Putin came from a sort of hardscrabble and
hard-luck story.

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:30.190
His father had been a wounded war veteran.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.060
Once the war was over, they lived in what
we would think of as poverty, although for

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.500
them it probably was a cut above.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.720
And, you know, his courtyard was his world.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:46.210
People remember him as a very scrappy, sort
of a slight young kid, smaller than you would

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:51.610
expect, but definitely somebody who would
fight you no matter how big you were.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:58.890
Putin was a product of this period after World
War II of rebuilding in the Soviet Union when

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.430
people actually had very, very little.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:06.450
They had come out of the war, especially [St.]
Petersburg, just devastated.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:13.110
I think for Putin, this sort of courtyard,
hardscrabble life was formative.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:20.210
He writes in his own memoirs, and he says
over and over again in times of duress, that

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:28.670
one of his great life lessons is never show
weakness because the weak are always defeated.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:33.940
The KGB as an organization that he aspired
to, for him it was probably a good career

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.940
step.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:40.820
People aspired to join the party or the KGB
because, you have to remember, there wasn’t

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.700
much else.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:52.420
For somebody that wanted some kind of interesting
career, there were not a lot of opportunities

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:58.260
in business in the Soviet Union, because private
profit and entrepreneurship were prohibited.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:04.120
This was a paternalistic state that provided,
supposedly, everything cradle to grave.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.570
Opportunities for creativity were limited,
and I think that Putin somehow had in his

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:15.360
mind that he would earn respect by this career
choice; that he liked the idea, basically,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.680
of being a cop, whether it was the KGB or
something like that.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.290
It was appealing to him because of his scrappy
nature.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.700
The KGB was many, many things in the Soviet
Union.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:33.940
It was both a foreign intelligence-gathering
organization that carried out the active measures

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.460
abroad to try and influence overseas affairs.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.580
But also it was the secret police.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:44.830
It was the organization that protected the
great party state, the Communist Party and

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.390
the government that it oversaw.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:52.770
It had a lot of power inside the Soviet Union,
and it was seriously feared by people.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:59.860
I think that the fear of the Great Terror
of the late 1930s, the sacrifices of World

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.490
War II, the thaw of the Khrushchev years,
all those phases had passed by the time Vladimir

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:13.279
Putin—and by the time Putin enters the KGB,
it’s really on the cusp of this period in

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.380
the whole country, this period known as stagnation.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.470
The Brezhnev years were coming, and this was
a period where people were sort of tired of

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.310
the great upheavals.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:29.029
Brezhnev’s calling card in this period was
he would bring “stability of the cadres.”

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:33.580
In other words, he wasn’t going to be firing
and executing and mixing it all up, everything.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.339
But everything got to be so stable that it
started to stagnate.

00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:41.580
The Soviet economic system started to go into
a long, slow decline.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:47.980
Because of the demands of the Cold War, the
demands of the budget for Cold War weaponry

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.660
and militarization were huge.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:57.250
Some people think that in this time period,
40 percent of Soviet Union GDP went basically

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.300
to military goods and things involved in the
Cold War.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.709
The country really couldn’t provide much
for consumers.

00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:10.779
And frankly, they didn’t think much about
providing items for consumers.

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:15.850
But consumers were somewhat aware of what
was happening in the world, so there was always

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.850
this tension of could you get a television
for your family?

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.120
Where would you get the television?

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.839
Did the Soviet system make them?

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:24.869
Yes, in limited numbers.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.119
Could you get a car?

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:31.820
A car was a dear thing to have in your family,
and many, many people longed for consumer

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.700
goods that the Soviet system didn't provide.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.960
There was not a sense of crass consumerism
because socialism had sort of pushed that

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.960
out.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.720
Little kids are taught from the very beginning
that profit was evil and wrong, and this was

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.809
going to be an egalitarian utopia.

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:56.880
But by the ’70s, it’s no longer really
a utopia, and the KGB also, although feared,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:03.350
it’s not the same KGB, or its predecessor,
the NKVD, in the 1930s.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:08.880
I think for Putin in some ways this is a good
career choice and may make him feel good.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.279
He’s trained by the KGB in all their long
history of things.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:16.100
And I'll give you an example.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.360
We think it very natural to go to a photocopier
and copy a document.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.379
But the Soviet party state, the Communist
Party, was deathly afraid of photocopiers.

00:18:25.379 --> 00:18:26.379
Why?

00:18:26.379 --> 00:18:28.820
Because they controlled information.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.149
There were literal censors in this system.

00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:34.009
The news was censored, literature.

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:38.240
There was lots of different ways that information
was controlled.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.389
Even in a factory, a normal factory making
widgets or ball bearings or pipes or something,

00:18:43.389 --> 00:18:46.690
of course, there might be one Xerox machine.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:52.389
But the Xerox machines were usually kept under
lock and key because the Soviet system did

00:18:52.389 --> 00:18:56.539
not want people to have the power to share
information.

00:18:56.539 --> 00:19:02.059
Information in the Soviet system was controlled
by the state, and that's what the KGB was

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:03.500
partly involved in.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:09.320
Some of these factories, in all of these factories,
there would be a KGB officer or somebody reporting

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.320
to the KGB.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.919
It was called the regime, and the regime would
always be able to blow the whistle on somebody

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:21.090
if they were passing around information that
wasn't authorized by the state.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:27.679
To me, the image of the locked-up Xerox machine
as a threat to the state has always been very

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:28.679
powerful.

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:31.740
That's the kind of thing that the KGB was
involved in.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.940
How do we keep control of information?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.870
And the KGB's job was enforcing it.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.100
They chased dissidents.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.659
They pursued Sakharov mercilessly and also
[Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn, you know.

00:19:43.659 --> 00:19:49.909
We now have the transcripts of these wiretaps
they put in, Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn, to

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:51.940
try and listen to what they were doing.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.190
Why was the KGB afraid of these guys?

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:01.760
They were afraid because Solzhenitsyn was
writing novels exposing the Gulag, exposing

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.549
the prison camps of an earlier period, and
they didn't want that.

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:11.999
And Sakharov was arguing for a different kind
of a Soviet Union, that it face its problems

00:20:11.999 --> 00:20:14.490
more openly, and they didn't want that.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.799
So the KGB was an instrument of control.

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:19.950
Putin tells a story.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:25.419
When he was just in the KGB before he was
sent to Dresden, he says, “I had to do a

00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:28.869
couple of cases here and there,” and he
talks some about things he did.

00:20:28.869 --> 00:20:33.619
And he tells the story about how some dissidents
were going to come, and they were going to

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:40.140
make a small little demonstration at some
monument in Leningrad, and KGB got wind of

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.140
it.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.279
So what did the KGB do?

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:44.739
They hired a little band.

00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:47.609
They put on the band uniforms themselves.

00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:54.460
They got their own wreaths, and they went,
and they had their own little tribute at this

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.559
statue before the dissidents got there.

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:57.820
They blocked them.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.080
And they didn't even reveal that they were
KGB.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:07.529
They just impersonated some people, and they
completely forced the dissidents out of their

00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:08.529
space.

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:14.679
That was a typical sort of small little trick
of how the KGB operated, which was deception

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:20.340
and subversion and protection and control
of the Soviet state, were the things that

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.139
Putin learned about, even if the state was
tottering and beginning to stagnate and it

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:27.049
was not the Great Terror.

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:30.610
The mass repressions of Stalin were a memory.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:36.039
MICHAEL KIRK - He, by all accounts, does not
rise through the ranks as a superstar by any

00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:37.190
stretch of the imagination.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:45.210
As you described his life in Dresden, it’s
pretty mundane as a young KGB officer.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.210
...

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:52.749
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Yeah, the reality of life
in the KGB for Vladimir Putin was actually

00:21:52.749 --> 00:21:54.519
mundane.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:59.259
He believed in the mission, but the work wasn't
all that exciting all the time.

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:04.830
I think that the state that he was trying
to defend and the events around him, especially

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.330
at the end, really came crashing down.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:12.039
He was never more than a lieutenant colonel
in 17 years in the service.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:20.409
MICHAEL KIRK - The stories of the stoking
of the furnace with the papers to save KGB

00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:27.860
information from KGB headquarters from a mob,
the walking out, calling Moscow, Moscow was

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:33.619
silent: Those stories sound a little bit like
something that was invented later.

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:36.169
Does it ring true to you?

00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:40.500
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I don't know about the
truth of these stories, but I think that what

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:47.850
does ring true is the idea of this KGB officer
on sort of the edge of the empire in a small

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:55.179
backwater, in an outpost, feeling overwhelmed
that the great state that he admired, the

00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:59.600
mission that had been really his life’s
ambition, was falling apart, and he felt helpless

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.029
about it.

00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:06.230
He was not involved in the great changes that
had come about, and he didn't even understand

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.999
them; he was far removed from them.

00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:13.369
And I think that there was a great sense on
his part of just absolute helplessness there.

00:23:13.369 --> 00:23:18.529
MICHAEL KIRK - ... You used a word to describe—when
we had a meeting a week ago, you used a word

00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:21.389
to describe what happens to those 800,000
KGB people.

00:23:21.389 --> 00:23:23.559
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - When he gets back, right.

00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:24.559
MICHAEL KIRK - Yeah.

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:27.109
And the word you used was “shipwrecked.”

00:23:27.109 --> 00:23:28.109
…

00:23:28.109 --> 00:23:33.690
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - When the Soviet Union collapses
in 1991, and Putin is back in Leningrad, and

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:41.749
he’s trying to find his way, but the whole
structure of the KGB really begins to crack

00:23:41.749 --> 00:23:48.090
up—now, there was a foreign intelligence
collection part that was hived off or separated

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.090
into a new thing.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:54.120
And actually, Boris Yeltsin broke the KGB
up into nine different organizations at one

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.809
point.

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.979
Border guards were given their own thing.

00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:04.690
Also, some of the domestic law enforcement
functions were also given into new, different

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.690
agencies.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:12.299
But the truth is that their very top guys
in the KGB got good jobs with these new oligarchs

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:14.399
who were rising in the 1990s.

00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:20.460
A few of the top KGB guys just simply moved
into the oligarchy capitalism and got good

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:26.259
jobs, but a lot of the people that had worked
in the KGB at Putin’s level were shipwrecked.

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:28.919
They didn't know what to do in this new society.

00:24:28.919 --> 00:24:34.470
The revolution that had taken place in Gorbachev's
time and the collapse of the Soviet Union,

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:39.889
which for so many people was like a breath
of fresh air, for them it was suffocating,

00:24:39.889 --> 00:24:45.269
because the values that they had stood for,
the whole ideal of the Soviet Union, of this

00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:50.039
utopia, had collapsed in utter disappointment
for most people.

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:53.479
They were seen as sort of leftovers from an
earlier time.

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:56.279
It was hard for them to find a place in a
new society.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:58.840
It was hard for them to find something to
believe in.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:04.929
It was hard for them to see these values of
entrepreneurship and capitalism and business

00:25:04.929 --> 00:25:09.830
springing up all around them when this had
always, in their training, been something

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.950
that was shunned.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:18.799
Remember, the Soviet socialism was a place
where entrepreneurship and business was prohibited.

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.890
The state ran everything.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:26.109
I think for KGB officers in this environment,
it was a very forbidding time.

00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:30.389
And I think part of it was mindset: Where
do they fit in?

00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:31.570
What kind of work do they do?

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.639
Part of it was very practical.

00:25:33.639 --> 00:25:36.979
What would they actually do with themselves,
some of them in the middle of their career?

00:25:36.979 --> 00:25:38.090
You think about Putin.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.129
He’s basically in the middle of his career.

00:25:40.129 --> 00:25:48.690
How does he start over if his skill set is,
you know, running low-level agents in Dresden?

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.489
MICHAEL KIRK - So what does he actually do?

00:25:52.489 --> 00:26:03.159
And in the doing of it, he and lots of people
like him, are they carrying a hope that the

00:26:03.159 --> 00:26:07.749
thing they don’t understand and don't really
believe in will eventually collapse on its

00:26:07.749 --> 00:26:08.749
own weight?

00:26:08.749 --> 00:26:14.019
Do they have a view of the Russian people
as needing strong authority, having had it

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:15.649
all for thousands of years?

00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:16.649
…

00:26:16.649 --> 00:26:20.389
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - You know, for a guy in
Putin’s shoes in this period of time, it

00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:22.460
must have been terribly disorienting.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.710
But I also think that he had a real streak
of pragmatism and realism.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:33.820
There wasn't much use spending your days putting
your toes in the lake and wondering what had

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.479
happened to the great Soviet Union.

00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:39.350
It was time to get out there and find a place
in this new society.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.899
It was a real thing that was happening around
him.

00:26:41.899 --> 00:26:46.789
There wasn't any denying it, and I don't think
Putin had any illusions at that time that

00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:50.029
gee, if he just waited a year, the Soviet
Union would come back.

00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:52.070
It wasn't coming back.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:59.820
Putin then essentially tried to look around
to find some particular piece of driftwood

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:07.669
he could grab onto to keep afloat in this
new society that was turbulent and uncertain.

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:13.919
There's a period in the late Gorbachev years
when cities, especially Moscow and St. Petersburg

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:20.639
and Nizhny Novgorod, were also cauldrons for
the new democracy and where leaders of cities

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:27.480
grew up as powerful voices like Gorbachev
for the values of freedom and liberty and

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.009
free enterprise.

00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:35.980
In Moscow, there was really kind of a salt-and-pepper-haired
professor named Gavriil Popov, who was a champion

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.259
of the new democrats.

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:44.190
And in Nizhny Novgorod, there was this young
physics professor named Boris Nemtsov who

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.640
got a lot of attention and became to lead
the city.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:52.951
And in St. Petersburg, there was Anatoly Sobchak,
who was in that early period—and I remember

00:27:52.951 --> 00:27:58.090
meeting him once when I was covering Secretary
of State [James] Baker, and we visited [St.]

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.090
Petersburg.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:04.909
These people were leaders by dint of their
inspiring speeches, by their voice, by the

00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:08.210
way they could articulate what freedom would
be like.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.183
But all of these young, new democrats in the
cities had a big, big problem and a big flaw,

00:28:12.183 --> 00:28:16.940
many of them, and that is they didn't know
how to run anything.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:23.919
Many of them had been professors or something
like that, but they had never run anything.

00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:30.299
And in Moscow, of course, the man who rescues
Popov is Yury Luzhkov, who was a factory director

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:32.259
and knew how to run things.

00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:38.299
I think in Petersburg, I think when Putin
was looking for something to do, helping Sobchak,

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:44.259
who he knew and had studied with, helping
him run that city at a time when Sobchak was

00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:47.480
giving the speeches was something he could
do.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.359
Putin was a guy in that environment with a
rambunctious—with a raucous city council

00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:58.259
and with Sobchak, who was the sort of voice
but didn't really know how to run the city.

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:02.019
Putin filled the gap of trying to get some
things done.

00:29:02.019 --> 00:29:04.570
What do I mean by getting things done?

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:11.009
One of the biggest problems of these cities
in this really tumultuous period, the bonds

00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:15.979
that had sort of held the Soviet Union together
broke, so there was a real problem of getting

00:29:15.979 --> 00:29:18.350
food to the cities.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.190
The food was in the countryside.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.619
There was no longer a command economy.

00:29:22.619 --> 00:29:26.749
There was no longer just pick up the phone
and order the food to be brought; you had

00:29:26.749 --> 00:29:28.169
to get the food.

00:29:28.169 --> 00:29:32.099
And this was an acute problem in St. Petersburg,
was food.

00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:33.929
People were hungry.

00:29:33.929 --> 00:29:40.690
Putin got deeply involved in a deal in which
resources, raw materials, metals and other

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:47.799
things that were in the St. Petersburg port
were traded with 19 companies, and it was

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:49.239
a very complex scheme.

00:29:49.239 --> 00:29:55.039
But the essence of it was that the raw materials
would be traded for food and that the money

00:29:55.039 --> 00:29:59.809
involved in selling these raw materials would
be used to buy the food, and the food would

00:29:59.809 --> 00:30:02.039
come to St. Petersburg and help the people.

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:08.889
Well, the raw materials disappeared, the money
came in and disappeared, and the food never

00:30:08.889 --> 00:30:10.409
arrived.

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:14.289
This scandal has been talked about a lot;
it’s not a new thing.

00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:20.989
But this whole machination of dealing with
overseas companies, of money going into mysterious

00:30:20.989 --> 00:30:26.239
bank accounts, of a deal that was supposed
to bring some benefit that didn't come through

00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:31.489
was Putin’s first experience with this wild
capitalism of the new Russia.

00:30:31.489 --> 00:30:40.289
I think that this experience must have left
him with the impression that some of the capitalism—it

00:30:40.289 --> 00:30:45.639
must have left him with this impression, that
capitalism was a really bizarre and wild place,

00:30:45.639 --> 00:30:52.870
maybe more arbitrary and maybe actually more
manipulable than a lot of people understood

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:53.979
in Soviet times.

00:30:53.979 --> 00:31:01.409
In other words, this was not a capitalism
of rules; this was not the kind of—let me

00:31:01.409 --> 00:31:04.179
think of a way to say this.

00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:11.450
This was a capitalism of deals, of machinations
of power, and of enrichment.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:16.739
That food deal in St. Petersburg is still
a big mystery, but we know that Putin was

00:31:16.739 --> 00:31:22.370
at the center of trying to deal with foreign
banks and foreign companies, and he did have

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:27.239
some exposure to this wild capitalism of the
new Russia in that period.

00:31:27.239 --> 00:31:34.879
Sobchak didn't last as a politician, and by
1996, he lost a bid for re-election [as mayor

00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:36.190
of St. Petersburg].

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.799
Putin remained loyal to him up to the very
end, but he also had to think of himself,

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:45.129
and he was looking for a job, and he essentially
started to look to Moscow.

00:31:45.129 --> 00:31:49.889
And he was brought to Moscow not because he
had any public persona.

00:31:49.889 --> 00:31:52.330
This was a guy who had never run for public
office.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:57.619
He was shy as can be, but he was known as
a guy who was kind of a bureaucrat who could

00:31:57.619 --> 00:31:59.610
get something done, you know?

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:00.649
He had done that for Sobchak.

00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:02.759
He had at least tried to get some things done.

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:08.729
He was brought into some minor positions in
the Kremlin in a department in the Kremlin

00:32:08.729 --> 00:32:14.109
that had dealt with things like the motor
pool and renovations of the Kremlin buildings

00:32:14.109 --> 00:32:15.289
and so on.

00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:21.090
Putin, step by step, worked his way up, a
little bit because he was faceless.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:25.690
The thing about Putin in this time that I
think is true is people sort of wrote upon

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.599
him what they wanted.

00:32:27.599 --> 00:32:33.309
He was such a man without a face that people
could say: “Oh, he’s a former KGB guy,

00:32:33.309 --> 00:32:35.080
and he also manages to get things done.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.639
Let’s give this job to him.”

00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:41.210
After having done a couple of these jobs,
he was named head of the FSB.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:47.789
The FSB was the successor agency at home inside
the country to the KGB.

00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:52.499
There was another agency that took care of
things abroad, and there was still some other

00:32:52.499 --> 00:32:55.239
different broken bits of the KGB.

00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:59.510
But the FSB became sort of the central successor.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.210
Putin was head of the FSB for about a year.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:15.009
But at this time, again in Yeltsin’s presidency,
you have to understand something about Yeltsin

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:16.779
and Yeltsin’s presidency.

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:25.460
Boris Yeltsin decided to break totalitarianism,
to crush what was left of communism with a

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:31.519
simple idea, which is maximum freedom first.

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:38.210
Yeltsin never got around to the important
rule of law that comes with a modern, healthy

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.210
democracy.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.700
He did the first part.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.559
By bringing out maximum freedom first, what
do I mean?

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:48.499
I mean that he essentially enabled people
to do almost anything, and people did a lot

00:33:48.499 --> 00:33:54.840
of wild things in those times, in the economy,
but if there were disputes, if two businessmen

00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:01.549
got into a dispute because they had started
a business in this environment of freedom,

00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:05.429
there weren't really courts they could rely
on to resolve the dispute.

00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:06.429
There was violence.

00:34:06.429 --> 00:34:14.339
Violence was a way to resolve disputes because
the rule-of-law system and the courts didn't

00:34:14.339 --> 00:34:16.149
function very well.

00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:22.480
All through this period, Yeltsin sort of pushed
forward this idea of maximum freedom first.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:28.089
As a philosophy, the idea was being that eventually
when you free people to do these things, to

00:34:28.089 --> 00:34:32.069
make these choices, they’ll want rules,
and they’ll come around and they’ll create

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:33.069
rules.

00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:36.609
But it’s Yeltsin’s great failure that
in this period, the rule of law never took

00:34:36.609 --> 00:34:37.609
hold.

00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:41.909
He really didn't pay it enough attention,
because Yeltsin was a guy who tore things

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:42.909
down.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.359
It was dramatic flourish, and people cheered.

00:34:46.359 --> 00:34:49.980
But he was not a guy who understood how to
build things up.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:55.210
The point at which Putin becomes director
of the FSB, this point in the 1990s, we're

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.640
in a period of maximum freedom freefall.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:04.690
The country essentially is experimenting on
every street corner with all kinds of new

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.970
ideas, including super wealth.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:11.930
The oligarchs are beginning to rise as a power
in the country, a group of five or six of

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:16.349
them becoming billionaires in the country
and running things.

00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:21.890
So this whole idea that we think of as a rule-of-law
society, where you have an SEC [Securities

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.670
and Exchange Commission] and where you have
markets that are regulated, was just beginning

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.789
to dawn in Russia.

00:35:28.789 --> 00:35:35.099
Again, Putin becomes in charge of this agency,
the Federal Security Service, but at a time

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:39.569
when the whole idea of the rule of law hasn’t
really been established.

00:35:39.569 --> 00:35:44.319
There are oligarchs and there are little baby
oligarchs, and there are all kinds of people

00:35:44.319 --> 00:35:47.810
in business who are far more powerful than
the state.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:53.910
And this really bugs Putin, again, because
he was a product of a big, unitary state that

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.369
seemed powerful, the Soviet Union.

00:35:56.369 --> 00:36:00.869
When he sees this, it’s often described
as chaos in Yeltsin’s time.

00:36:00.869 --> 00:36:05.980
But I think “chaos” is a word that even
Putin himself has applied to it.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:11.040
But I lived there, and in that period of time,
I think it’s much better to think of [it]

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:17.339
as completely unbridled freedom, and for a
people that had been in the prison of totalitarianism

00:36:17.339 --> 00:36:21.480
for 70 years, completely unbridled freedom
was an experience.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.329
It wasn't entirely bad.

00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:28.730
And Yeltsin never, never closed down a newspaper
in his time.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.980
He believed in freedom like he breathed the
air.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:36.430
But Yeltsin also just could not understand
that you had to have rules.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:41.740
And for Putin, who comes in and is put in
charge of a law enforcement agency at a time

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.519
when nobody understands the rules, it must
have been very, very bewildering.

00:36:46.519 --> 00:36:47.519
...

00:36:47.519 --> 00:36:53.260
So, after the collapse of the Russian economy
in 1998, Boris Yeltsin had a problem, which

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:59.550
was he’d gone through several prime ministers,
appointing them, firing them, and the point

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.529
came in 1999 when he needed a new prime minister.

00:37:03.529 --> 00:37:10.039
I think Vladimir Putin was chosen because,
again, looking at Putin at the time, the people

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:15.400
around Yeltsin sort of imprinted upon him
what they liked to see, which is he gets things

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:23.599
done; he’ll be loyal; he has connections
to the security services, but he also believes

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.000
in the new system.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.480
Frankly, I don't think they thought it through
very much.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.400
The presidency in Russia was a super presidency,
OK?

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.410
The president of Russia had a lot of power
and a completely separate structure to run

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.750
things, the presidential administration.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:45.630
The prime minister was the head of the government
that implemented things and head of the ministries.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:51.880
But when they named Putin prime minister,
it just seemed like another faceless person

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:59.210
in a string of prime ministers, and it sort
of suggested that Yeltsin didn't really get,

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:05.230
after almost nine years in power, have any
idea about how to build a modern state.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.500
He was just reveling in freedom.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.240
I think there's a thing about Yeltsin you
just have to understand at this time, which

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:19.940
is that his entire persona was that of a bear,
and a bear who would hibernate and then at

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:24.950
the last minute, starving, desperate, maybe
on the edge of survival, a bear that would

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:29.370
come out with a huge great surge of energy
and recover.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:33.800
Yeltsin had always gone through these great
hibernations and then surges.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:39.529
Now, we now know that some of the hibernation
was because he drank a lot, like almost all

00:38:39.529 --> 00:38:41.580
men did in his country.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:46.819
But he also had a very serious heart problem,
and he had heart surgery in 1996.

00:38:46.819 --> 00:38:51.790
But the critical thing about his character,
the important thing, is that he operated this

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:52.790
way.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.569
His life was sort of to hibernate and to surge.

00:38:55.569 --> 00:39:01.109
And there were periods, especially in 1999,
after that ruble crash in Russia after the

00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:07.299
1998 crisis, there was a period of terrible
vacuum and volatility, and Yeltsin wasn’t

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:08.460
really running the country.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:13.079
It seemed to me at the time that the oligarchs
were actually running the country behind the

00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:14.079
scenes.

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:19.330
So Putin was picked in this vacuum, in this
environment when rule of law hadn’t been

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:24.859
brought about, when Yeltsin’s long experiment
in freedom first seemed to be producing a

00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:31.359
society in which essentially a bunch of rich
oligarchs were working behind the scenes.

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:37.210
Yeltsin also sometimes would rally, and he
was trying to, but [when] he picked Putin

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:43.900
in August of 1999, I think maybe there was
a hope that Putin would be like him.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.619
But I don't think that at that time he actually
picked Putin to be his successor.

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:50.980
He was just picking another prime minister.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.579
But events then came along to change the course
of history really quickly.

00:39:56.579 --> 00:40:02.150
In September, just a month after Putin became
prime minister, there were a series of horrible

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:05.890
bombings of apartment buildings in the middle
of Moscow.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.359
You can't imagine what a terrible moment this
was for people in Moscow.

00:40:10.359 --> 00:40:11.950
This was their 9/11.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:18.491
This was a time when these big, tall, seven-story
apartment buildings built in the 1950s out

00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:23.529
of stone and brick just blew up all in the
middle of the night.

00:40:23.529 --> 00:40:26.940
People were killed in the middle of the night
when the apartment blew up.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.920
It happened in Moscow; it happened in two
other cities over a period of two weeks or

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.309
so, and more than 300 people died, and 1,000
people were injured.

00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:38.109
And nobody knew where this was coming from.

00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:41.109
It created a great sense of anxiety and panic.

00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:42.539
Who would be next?

00:40:42.539 --> 00:40:43.849
Where would be next?

00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:45.099
Why was this happening?

00:40:45.099 --> 00:40:50.619
Of course, at the time, Putin blamed this
on the Chechen rebels.

00:40:50.619 --> 00:40:56.750
The Chechen war, there had been a war fought
in the ’90s when Chechnya wanted to secede,

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:01.640
and it had been fought to a draw, only to
a cease-fire.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.789
The rebellion had continued in Chechnya in
a sort of low-grade way, and Putin said that

00:41:06.789 --> 00:41:13.140
these apartment buildings had been blown up
and vowed to suppress this.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.800
He vowed to suppress this rebellion in Chechnya
once and for all.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:22.960
He launched a military operation against Chechnya
unlike anything Russia had seen in a long

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.960
time.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:30.049
It was a very, very brutal and fast military
operation to try and roll through Chechnya

00:41:30.049 --> 00:41:31.950
and crush the rebellion.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:39.930
One of the things that happened is that the
nature of what was going on in Chechnya was

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.270
such that there were new forces.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:49.839
The Chechen rebels themselves had morphed
a little bit, and just before this happened,

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:54.270
rebels in Chechnya had broken out from the
Chechen Republic into Dagestan.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:58.160
Dagestan is a neighboring republic that was
multiethnic.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.380
There were more than 30 nationalities.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.260
It’s an amazing quilt, a crazy quilt of
nationalities.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:09.599
But this was very alarming in Moscow, because
if the rebels were going to move into essentially

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:16.890
another big area of Russia and stir foment
and trouble, Putin believed at the time, and

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:21.750
said: “We face a problem of the Russian
state holding together.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.730
If this goes on, Russia could become Yugoslavia.”

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:32.220
And that image of a Yugoslav-style breakup
was on his mind as he launched that offensive

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:38.000
and as those apartment houses were blowing
up, that if we don’t stop this now, Russia

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.930
could break up like Yugoslavia.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.510
It was that close.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:48.240
He felt, and at least he felt, at least, that
the Russian state was at risk, and the only

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.430
way to save it was a show of strength.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:58.380
Remember his own statements [that] to show
weakness is to invite defeat, so this military

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:02.410
offensive that he launched—and now he’s
still prime minister, and Yeltsin is still

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:09.950
the president—this military offensive in
the autumn of 1999 mesmerized Russian society,

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.150
galvanized the people.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:17.779
The Russian people at this point had been
beaten down, not by the chaos but just by

00:43:17.779 --> 00:43:22.260
the upheaval of the freedom revolution of
Yeltsin.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:27.300
I mean, they were just so free and so surprising
all the time in the ’90s, I think people

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.740
were exhausted.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.549
People were exhausted from change.

00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:34.460
Many Russians, to try and stay afloat, were
working three jobs.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:40.609
People were trying to save, then there’d
be a crash, and their currency would be devalued.

00:43:40.609 --> 00:43:46.339
People were enjoying the idea of the ’90s
that you could go abroad.

00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:49.299
Russians went abroad for vacations in droves.

00:43:49.299 --> 00:43:54.420
Huge 747s flew out of Moscow’s airports
full of school kids.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:59.289
Their parents had never been given the right
to go on a holiday to Paris or to London.

00:43:59.289 --> 00:44:04.349
But seeing the rest of the wider world in
the 1990s opened a lot of people’s eyes.

00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:05.650
And then they came home.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:11.550
They came home to this country that Yeltsin
was running like a sandbox of tantrums all

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:12.550
the time.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:18.890
It was a place of just wild freedom, and I
think they were tired.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:26.200
When Putin launches this military offensive,
he became really an overnight sensation.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.710
Russians watched him on TV, and they said:
“You know what?

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.809
This guy, he's a cougar.

00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:33.860
He is tough and fast and svelte.”

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.700
They loved it.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:43.260
And you have to see from the feelings they
had toward Yeltsin of, especially in his long

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:48.070
periods of hibernation, from the feeling of
drift and the feeling of uncertainty that

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:53.619
the freedom had brought, Putin provided the
salve of some kind of strength and stability

00:44:53.619 --> 00:44:56.430
that was extremely appealing.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:01.609
Putin’s popularity rocketed like nothing
I had ever seen in the 1990s.

00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:07.210
He was not one of the whole flanks of politicians
who might have risen to the top to be Yeltsin's

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:08.210
successor.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:13.440
There were plenty of them, and they had all
been tried and tested in the ’90s, and none

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:21.970
of them achieved this kind of sudden and very,
very evident, televised charisma that Putin

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:29.600
showed by going after—he said of those Chechens,
he said, “We’ll rub them out in the outhouse.”

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.570
People loved it because that's how they felt.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:36.700
You know, they knew people that had died and
those apartment buildings collapsed at 3:00

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.700
in the morning.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.130
They were mad and angry.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.190
He capitalized on that; he exploited it.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:48.799
It became more clear in the late autumn that,
I think to Yeltsin, that he wasn't going to

00:45:48.799 --> 00:45:53.490
make it to the next presidential election,
which was the following year in March.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:58.460
So Yeltsin and the people around him, which
included some of the oligarchs and his daughter

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:04.920
Tatyana, began to essentially look for a successor,
a handpicked successor.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.359
This was an incredibly important moment for
Russia, because the way Russian democracy

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:13.640
was set up and the way the constitution was
written was there was supposed to be an election,

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.549
and people were going to vote for a parliament
in December, and they were going to vote in

00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:20.069
the following spring for a president.

00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:27.480
But Yeltsin himself, the great champion of
democracy, essentially began to look for a

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.460
handpicked successor.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:34.359
I think that this is an incredibly important
moment for the future of the country, because

00:46:34.359 --> 00:46:40.160
had he left it to democratic choice, we don’t
really know who might have come out on top.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.000
It's quite possible at that time—Putin was
far more popular than anybody else; it’s

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.079
quite possible it would have come out the
same way, but it also was Yeltsin’s desire.

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:54.579
I think he was in a period of great hibernation.

00:46:54.579 --> 00:46:59.190
I mean, I think he was in just one of those
periods where he couldn't see the future and

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:04.680
he decided to retire, to announce to the country
he was going to leave at New Year’s.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:09.990
In the weeks and months before that, somebody
had to be found to kind of be his handpicked

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.280
successor, because he’d have to name an
acting president.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.250
And that was the mantle of the future.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:24.319
Putin, having done so well, Putin having galvanized
the society and having rocketed to the top,

00:47:24.319 --> 00:47:26.390
seemed to be the obvious choice.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:28.150
This was not an easy choice.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:33.560
I think that in the back of Yeltsin’s mind,
he had to answer for himself the question,

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.759
will this guy continue the things I care about,
at least in a big way?

00:47:37.759 --> 00:47:44.200
Maybe he looked at the blank screen, he looked
at Putin and said yes.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.799
Maybe he didn't know.

00:47:45.799 --> 00:47:50.650
Maybe the oligarchs looked at Putin, and what
they saw in him was a puppet, somebody they

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:55.720
could manipulate, ... and maybe the Yeltsin
family looked at Putin and thought, here's

00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:01.020
a guy who won't hurt us, because every outgoing
Russian leader worries that he’s going to

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.900
be prosecuted or maybe worse.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:10.109
I think there was a certainly a desire to
find somebody that would leave Yeltsin and

00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:15.650
the family alone, and again, Putin fit the
bill.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:20.869
Putin was told by Yeltsin of this.

00:48:20.869 --> 00:48:24.500
Yeltsin said, “I'm going to give you this,”
and Putin said, “No, I'm not ready.”

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.150
Yeltsin said: “Look, I wasn’t ready either.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:28.150
This is just the way it is.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:29.700
You have to do it.”

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.161
I think it’s very telling, what Putin said
when he said, “I'm not ready,” because

00:48:34.161 --> 00:48:40.320
really, Putin only three or four years sooner
had been a nobody who came into Moscow looking

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:47.339
for a job, and he had certainly now been working
at the highest levels.

00:48:47.339 --> 00:48:49.420
He had been head of the FSB.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.480
He also was on the Russian Security Council.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.569
Then he was prime minister.

00:48:53.569 --> 00:49:00.530
But I think that this is a moment where the
Putin that is coming to power has never, ever

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:03.030
faced an election in his life.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:07.569
Democracy, which was really the coin of the
realm for Yeltsin's Russia, it didn't mean

00:49:07.569 --> 00:49:08.640
anything to him.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.920
He had never participated in it in any way.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.289
He never had to ask a voter, ever, for a vote.

00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:18.661
And he actually didn't like electioneering
and democracy.

00:49:18.661 --> 00:49:19.661
He hadn’t come from that world.

00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:24.730
He’d come from the world of control, from
a party state that had a monopoly on power.

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:27.690
The Soviet Communist Party had no competition.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.099
It's an important thing to remember in the
future.

00:49:31.099 --> 00:49:39.170
On Dec. 29, 1999, Putin had published and
issued a manifesto.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:43.430
It's sometimes called the “Millennium Manifesto,”
because if you remember that week, we were

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:47.019
all worried about the millennium, the Y2K
bug.

00:49:47.019 --> 00:49:50.380
And this “Millennium Manifesto” is a really
interesting document.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:54.490
I think it’s worth just mentioning for a
second because this question of who is Mr.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:56.280
Putin was unanswered.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:02.730
Sure, the Russian people saw this cougar,
you know, this guy who was cracking down on

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:05.660
Chechnya and showing strength and popularity.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.559
But what did he really care about?

00:50:07.559 --> 00:50:08.890
What were his values?

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:10.370
They didn’t really know.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:19.579
… This long essay reflects, I think, again,
Putin’s sense of telling people what they

00:50:19.579 --> 00:50:20.660
want to hear.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:25.570
He addresses in this essay the need to rebuild
the Russian state, and he addresses some of

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:29.289
the things that we're going to see later that
he feels Russia’s weak.

00:50:29.289 --> 00:50:33.040
We missed the boat in the world economy; we've
got to get going.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.359
But there's also a part of this thing that
is very modern.

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:41.800
If you remember that Russia at this time,
its biggest, biggest problem is that it was

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.329
a backward country.

00:50:43.329 --> 00:50:49.640
What was inherited from the Soviet Union were
old, tired factories that weren't working,

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.849
desperate need in all the country for modernization.

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.970
And for modernization, you need capital.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.099
And for capital, Russia didn't have any.

00:50:57.099 --> 00:51:03.819
It needed foreign capitalists to invest; it
needed foreign investors desperately.

00:51:03.819 --> 00:51:10.050
The whole ’90s was an effort to see if you
could free markets and bring that investment,

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.680
because there were things to be done.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:18.160
Putin strikes a tone in this manifesto that
persuades a lot of people that he’s a modernizer.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.130
He believes in a strong state, but also that
he believes in this market experiment that's

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:26.519
been going on almost, at that point, for a
decade.

00:51:26.519 --> 00:51:32.170
I think the very, very interesting thing about
this is that many Westerners studied this

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:38.980
and concluded that Putin was going to be basically
a younger, stronger Yeltsin, and they were

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.980
wrong.

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:45.109
MICHAEL KIRK - So, it’s New Year’s Eve.

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:46.109
Set the scene.

00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:53.180
Be as graphic as you can about the surroundings
and the circumstances where Yeltsin names

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.410
Putin.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:52:01.619
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Yeltsin’s decision took
the country by surprise, and me.

00:52:01.619 --> 00:52:07.500
I had actually started to work on a book about
the oligarchs, and I cleared my desk the day

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.700
before New Year’s Eve and said: “I'm not
to be bothered.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.740
I'm going to be working on this book project.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.290
Don’t even bother me.”

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:20.410
And somebody knocks on the door and says,
“There are rumors Yeltsin’s resigning

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.410
tonight.”

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:26.329
So all during that afternoon, the wires, Interfax
and TASS were going crazy because the rumor’s

00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:30.000
starting to spill out in the afternoon before
the announcement.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.039
Then it was confirmed Yeltsin would go on
television that night.

00:52:35.039 --> 00:52:36.039
...

00:52:36.039 --> 00:52:40.460
Boris Yeltsin goes on television to make a
speech that is terribly, deeply melancholy

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:46.940
because the great bear, the surging hero,
the guy who’d stood on the tank, confesses

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.849
to Russians that he wasn't able to accomplish
all he wanted to.

00:52:50.849 --> 00:52:56.910
And boy, do they know it, because they know
from all these years of struggle with democracy

00:52:56.910 --> 00:53:02.869
and free markets that you can't eat democracy,
and the disenchantment with a lot of what

00:53:02.869 --> 00:53:06.840
Yeltsin stood for is palatable in the Russian
people.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:13.400
For all of his great strengths in doing these
things and really burying communism, and for

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:19.730
all of the fact that he stood for freedom
to the end and never tried to impose censorship

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:25.079
again, by the time Yeltsin says, “I failed,”
people all agreed with him.

00:53:25.079 --> 00:53:26.079
...

00:53:26.079 --> 00:53:30.720
The thing about Putin, who was named his successor,
is that he had the promise, the vigor, the

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.720
youth.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.400
It was a question of comparing these two.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:41.819
Yeltsin was old and spent and tired, and Putin
was active and vibrant and virile and pursuing

00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:44.540
real policies of strength.

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:48.190
There seemed to be at least some hope for
another phase.

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:59.309
MICHAEL KIRK - When Putin gets it, how quickly,
David, do you know we're not in Kansas anymore?

00:53:59.309 --> 00:54:09.360
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Putin’s manifesto, which
had caused a lot of people to chew it over

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.599
and think what does this guy stand for, was
a placeholder for a while.

00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:20.020
I myself as a correspondent for The Washington
Post and many other newspaper correspondents

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:25.200
and television correspondents and foreign
investors were puzzling over who is Mr. Putin.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.319
It was a very common question in the first
period.

00:54:28.319 --> 00:54:30.180
And Putin began to act rather quickly.

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:36.619
One of the first things he did was to take
control of television.

00:54:36.619 --> 00:54:40.039
One of the first things he did was to take
control of television, because more than 90

00:54:40.039 --> 00:54:43.240
percent of Russians got all their news from
television.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:49.619
But in Yeltsin’s time, the big television
stations had fallen into the hands of the

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:53.039
oligarchs who were improving them in some
ways.

00:54:53.039 --> 00:54:59.420
NTV television was very independent and certainly
had a big following among people that had

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:02.070
hopes for democracy in Russia.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:08.799
And Channel One, which was the biggest television
station, spanning all the time zones of Russia,

00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:12.539
which reached the most people, was in the
hands of Boris Berezovsky, one of the most

00:55:12.539 --> 00:55:18.319
ambitious of the Yeltsin oligarchs and the
one personally closest to the Yeltsin family.

00:55:18.319 --> 00:55:24.230
Putin faced down Berezovsky very soon in that
first year and basically said, “I want Channel

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:25.230
One.”

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:28.269
And you know, that's all he had to say.

00:55:28.269 --> 00:55:29.269
He got it.

00:55:29.269 --> 00:55:31.119
With [NTV founder Vladimir] Gusinsky, it was
a little more difficult.

00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:32.119
He pressured him.

00:55:32.119 --> 00:55:37.839
At one point, he threw him in a horrible prison
for a little while to sit and think and then

00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:45.710
forced him also to give up his television
station to a subsidiary of Gazprom, the huge

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:48.130
state natural gas monopoly.

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:54.230
By taking over this means of communication,
Putin began to immediately shape what he wanted

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:58.480
to tell people about the Russia that he would
have and about the kind of things he wanted

00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.480
to do.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:05.430
He also was the star, and people, even in
other television and other people in the media,

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:11.869
got the idea that Vladimir Putin cared a lot
about what was said in the public-political

00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:17.829
space, in the information space, which is
television and newspapers and so on.

00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:24.509
People began to get the message that he was
going to act and that he cared about control

00:56:24.509 --> 00:56:25.769
of the media.

00:56:25.769 --> 00:56:31.450
At the time, some of the newspapers were still
quite independent, but taking television was

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:32.680
a moment.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:38.539
It was followed very soon after that by a
campaign against the oligarchs, and Putin’s

00:56:38.539 --> 00:56:43.630
message to these oligarchs, who had become
powerful in Yeltsin’s time and [during]

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:48.050
Yeltsin’s flowering of freedom, Putin’s
message was: “Look, we're going to have

00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:49.760
new terms.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.190
The terms are I'm going to run the state,
not you.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:58.451
If you want to cooperate with me, if you want
to follow my rules, you can stay here and

00:56:58.451 --> 00:56:59.720
make some money.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.869
But if you don’t, I can't live with it.

00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:04.680
I can't tolerate it.”

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:09.150
This bargain, which was hammered out in secret,
I've never actually seen it if it was written

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:11.420
down, but it was a tacit bargain.

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:14.109
Gusinsky and Berezovsky both left the country.

00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:18.730
[Oil company Yukos head] Mikhail Khodorkovsky
thought he could work with Putin for a while,

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.750
and he stayed inside, and some of the others
did, too.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:29.349
This increasingly was a focus of Putin because
the oligarchs had held the power, and he wanted

00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:30.480
to consolidate the power.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.039
He wanted to get the power of the state back
in his own hands.

00:57:33.039 --> 00:57:34.630
In the manifesto.

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:39.819
At the time he even became prime minister,
back when he worried about Yugoslavia, Putin’s

00:57:39.819 --> 00:57:43.359
thinking, how do I rebuild the Russian state?

00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:49.490
I have to tell you that this may sound odd
to people, that Putin is wondering, how do

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:51.849
I make a big, powerful country?

00:57:51.849 --> 00:57:55.510
People might be thinking, well, isn't he worried
about health care or education or things like

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:56.510
that?

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.190
But remember the environment here.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:04.200
The Soviet Union, this giant thing, just collapsed
overnight.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:11.079
And communism, which was deeply, deeply ingrained
in minds of people for decades, was replaced

00:58:11.079 --> 00:58:16.440
by some ideals of freedom and of democracy
and markets that weren't even very well explained

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.269
or understood by people.

00:58:18.269 --> 00:58:23.779
So when the ’90s become this cauldron where
people struggle with this, for Putin, the

00:58:23.779 --> 00:58:28.760
number one issue that he has to deal with
is the fact that the Russian state might become

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.190
a Yugoslavia and break up and the whole idea
of it might disappear.

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:38.210
So he’s thinking often about how to reassert
control.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:42.819
Another thing he begins to do is to rebuild
the security services and particularly the

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:47.559
FSB, again, thinking that a strong state needs
a strong security service.

00:58:47.559 --> 00:58:49.779
But this is not the Soviet Union.

00:58:49.779 --> 00:58:55.660
The Soviet Union was the state with an ideology,
with a point of view about the world and about

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.799
socialism.

00:58:56.799 --> 00:59:02.480
Putin is trying to build a strong state in
a kind of wild version of capitalism.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:09.430
He actually understood that Yeltsin had failed
to build a rule of law, and Putin very quickly

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:17.150
early in his term brought in some important
legislation, laws to update the way corporations

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:20.890
functioned, laws to govern the sale of land.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:28.210
He started to work on this, and at one point
he said he wanted to impose diktatura zakon,

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:32.049
the “dictatorship of law.”

00:59:32.049 --> 00:59:38.180
I asked myself, which part of that phrase
does he really understand?

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:42.069
In a rule-of-law state, there is no dictatorship.

00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:43.460
But this is how he thought about it.

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:52.240
He said, “I want to liquidate the oligarchs
as a class,” but by 2003, he internally

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:58.640
began to liquidate the oligarchs that existed
from Yeltsin’s time and replaced them with

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.200
his own pals.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:10.759
MICHAEL KIRK - Also in this time, George W.
Bush is elected president of the United States.

01:00:10.759 --> 01:00:18.980
His feeling as he goes to that first meeting
with George W. Bush, his feeling about America

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.700
in those early days of his presidency, those
first couple of years?

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.490
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Just let me finish one
thought, though.

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:29.650
In that first Putin term, which runs to 2004,
at which time he’s trying to rebuild the

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:36.680
state, he is faced with some real gut punches
that he didn't expect that made it harder.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.320
Twice there were Chechen terrorist attacks:
in 2004 in a theater in—I mean, in 2002

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:48.450
in a theater in Moscow, and in 2004 in [a
school in] Beslan.

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:50.880
These two attacks were particularly vicious.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.150
Hundreds of people died, and many Russians
sort of began to wonder, do we still have

01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:00.589
that Putin that showed such great strength
in 1999 and early 2000?

01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:07.170
I think for Putin, these terrorist attacks
also slowed down the process.

01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:10.859
For Putin, these terrorist attacks were something
he had to face and confront.

01:01:10.859 --> 01:01:16.779
It was a really difficult time, and he answered
the challenge of this by essentially beginning

01:01:16.779 --> 01:01:22.720
to impose more authoritarianism and rolling
back Boris Yeltsin’s democracy.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:28.259
After the Beslan attack in 2004, he switched
the election of governors to make them appointed

01:01:28.259 --> 01:01:29.609
by him.

01:01:29.609 --> 01:01:33.829
The rules of election to the parliament were
fiddled with and manipulated.

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:40.339
So you see in this period, even by 2004, after
that particular attack, that Putin is rolling

01:01:40.339 --> 01:01:47.930
back the maximum freedom that Yeltsin had
created.

01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:52.349
I think Putin wanted some breathing room with
the United States at the beginning, and he

01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:59.089
thought up some idea that he would pitch to
the new president in the United States, George

01:01:59.089 --> 01:02:04.349
Bush, for a compromise of some kind on missile
defense.

01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:09.720
It was kind of an elaborate idea of a compromise,
and he presented it once to Bush.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:15.369
Then a little bit later, Bush, absolutely
unilaterally and without telling Putin, simply

01:02:15.369 --> 01:02:18.749
abrogated the missile defense treaty, the
ABM [Anti-Ballistic Missile] Treaty, which

01:02:18.749 --> 01:02:21.619
dated from 1972.

01:02:21.619 --> 01:02:29.249
This was kind of a rude shock for Putin because
in his mind, at least, maybe he could be seen

01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:30.489
as an equal.

01:02:30.489 --> 01:02:34.779
The Soviet Union was always an equal to the
United States in the Cold War.

01:02:34.779 --> 01:02:40.680
Maybe he felt that even if Russia was weak,
if he showed some flexibility and compromise,

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:48.499
he could have a kind of a period of detente
again, or at least respect, that the United

01:02:48.499 --> 01:02:50.589
States would deal with him.

01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:55.270
When Bush abrogated the treaty, especially
in the way that he did, I think Putin was

01:02:55.270 --> 01:03:00.920
at least internally shocked and a little bit
set back and beginning to wonder.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.630
This also was followed by the Iraq War, which
also shocked him.

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:14.900
The use of raw military force to overthrow
somebody quickly without—it was just something—Putin

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:18.730
is beginning to get shocks from the United
States rather than cooperation.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.649
MICHAEL KIRK - Right.

01:03:20.649 --> 01:03:26.690
… For the United States to step generally
in the sphere of the Middle East, generally

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:35.779
in the sphere of Russia, knock off a leader,
a despot, whatever, certainly might have started

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:41.509
or rung some bells in a leader who felt he
was potentially similarly vulnerable.

01:03:41.509 --> 01:03:45.470
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Think about where Putin’s
sitting, right?

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:53.049
To him, he’s had two major terrorist attacks
in 2002 and 2004 from Chechen rebels.

01:03:53.049 --> 01:03:59.130
Meanwhile in Georgia, in 2003, there's a color
revolution, the Rose Revolution, that throws

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:04.730
out Eduard Shevardnadze, and a new guy, [Mikheil]
Saakashvili, rises up on the shoulders of

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:06.599
people [in] protest.

01:04:06.599 --> 01:04:13.190
In 2004, in nearby Ukraine, which he sees
as really part of a smaller Russia, a country

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:17.670
that's been very, very close to Russia for
centuries, there's another color revolution,

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:23.499
the Orange Revolution, and again, popular
unrest throws somebody out.

01:04:23.499 --> 01:04:29.579
Then he’s also seeing the United States
acting as a hyperpower, acting in his view,

01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:33.910
if you're watching it from his point of view,
without listening to him and certainly without

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:38.010
giving him the kind of respect that he thinks
Russia should get.

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:46.750
Now, it is also true that in this time, Putin
didn't have a lot of cards to play with.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:51.640
This was no longer the Cold War between two
huge blocs.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:57.240
In fact, NATO had already been expanded some
and was going to expand more—another shock

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.400
to Putin in this time period.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:06.559
I think all the period that Putin is governing
in the first two terms, there is a mixture

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:14.380
of his effort to sort of control things at
home and keep the kettle lid on, and coping

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:21.309
with these shocks from abroad, both the near
abroad and the far abroad; that these were

01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:26.309
the kind of shocks that he has to question,
“Are they going to come for me?”

01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:30.799
These are moments where he’s going to wonder,
“What is happening in the world when such

01:05:30.799 --> 01:05:34.070
things can be done so arbitrarily and suddenly?”

01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:43.040
Nothing in his preparation for politics, nothing
in his 17 years of the KGB, prepares him to

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:50.200
understand that when people head to the streets
in protest that they have a legitimate claim.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.200
People power scares him terribly, and he doesn't
see any legitimacy in it.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:02.130
He thinks that legitimacy is the kind of power
that he knew from the Soviet times, which

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:06.010
was from the top, from a party, from a party
state.

01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:12.730
You know, I think that this is a kind of thing
where Putin himself understood the importance

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:16.859
to maintain kind of a patina of democracy.

01:06:16.859 --> 01:06:22.009
But he also wanted to create a state where
there would be no competition to him.

01:06:22.009 --> 01:06:27.359
This you see from the beginning and certainly
through the 2000s.

01:06:27.359 --> 01:06:33.220
He wanted to create a state where he would
be the unchallenged leader.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.690
That meant he did not want to have competition
in elections.

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:43.210
Competition is the oxygen of democracy, and
he was gradually sucking it out.

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:50.670
After Beslan, taking it away and certainly
after Beslan, there is a speech that he gave

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:58.609
where he talked about his fear that the outside
world was trying to break up Russia some more.

01:06:58.609 --> 01:07:03.309
He says, “Somebody out there”—he doesn't
name—“would like to tear off a juicy bit

01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:11.359
of pie from Russia,” and you see this deep-seated
fear and paranoia that maybe outside powers

01:07:11.359 --> 01:07:12.769
are coming for Russia, too.

01:07:12.769 --> 01:07:14.450
MICHAEL KIRK - But wait a minute.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:20.539
We've had a parade of ambassadors walk in
here and say, "We wanted to work with him.

01:07:20.539 --> 01:07:23.339
We offered him this; we offered that; we did
this.

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:24.749
… We were there for him.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:27.269
We wanted to help them.”

01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:28.880
Clean that up for me, will you?

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.040
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I've puzzled about this
a lot.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.720
It’s puzzling.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.589
The first thing is that Putin already understood,
I think, that NATO expansion was a fait accompli,

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:45.910
at least the first round, and that the old
Warsaw Pact and the Soviet bloc itself was

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:51.049
never going to—but there was the issue of
what was once part of the Soviet Union.

01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:53.289
This is much more near and dear to him.

01:07:53.289 --> 01:08:00.859
The near abroad—and especially I think the
Central Asia part of it was of less concern,

01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:04.190
and the Baltics, of course were already gone.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:10.349
But Ukraine and Georgia were touchstones of
this, because both of them had been important

01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:16.880
parts of the Soviet Union, and people forget
now, but Georgia in the post-Soviet years

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.390
was a mess.

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:25.660
Parts of the country were hived off in small
little wars, and Russians themselves maintained

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:30.890
bases in Georgia through part of the 1990s,
just open military bases.

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:34.480
So there was a lot of confusion about what
this Georgia would be.

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.090
And Shevardnadze was, even though sort of
a hero of the Gorbachev era, by this period,

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:45.200
Shevardnadze was seen as old and tired, and
that's what the Rose Revolution was about.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.180
It was about a new order.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.060
But for Putin, that was something of his immediate
concern.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.180
This was not something he had given up on,
the idea that Russia would have a sphere of

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.960
influence that incorporated some parts of
the former Soviet Union.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.040
MICHAEL KIRK - And they become hot buttons
for him.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.880
I mean, “You touched that.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880
You're in my neighborhood.”

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.730
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - They become hot buttons
for him, and this is someplace where the West

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:10.970
was actively involved.

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:12.820
There is no question.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:18.470
I think to even put it in a larger way, there
was no question that in democracy promotion

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:24.730
and in talking with the near abroad, the West,
Europe and the United States were extremely

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:32.460
active, and this activity should be seen for
what it was, because many, many times in the

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:38.350
West, people thought after so many years of
totalitarianism, after the Soviet collapse

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:44.690
that we paid for in blood and treasure over
the long four decades of the Cold War, we

01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:51.960
ought to essentially help these lands become
part of the global economy that's now globalizing

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.970
rapidly, that is becoming democratic rapidly.

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.190
Let's give them the knowhow.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:10:02.240
Billions of dollars were spent by the United
States and other countries, the Europeans

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:08.400
in particular, to go to these places, to show
how democracy markets worked, how the free

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.940
press worked.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:16.290
A lot of this training about democracy was
viewed with suspicion by Putin, because he

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:20.040
thought maybe it was a cover for some kind
of subversion.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.040
It wasn't.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.540
He had a complete misunderstanding and misconception.

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:27.240
But this isn't the only thing that was going
on.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:32.760
You know, we spent billions of dollars trying
to help Russia in these years cope with the

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.820
legacy of the Soviet nuclear weapons program.

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.930
This is a country that had fissile material,
uranium and plutonium laying in warehouses

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:43.260
across 11 time zones.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:48.550
We built for $300 million a Fort Knox in the
middle of Russia that stands there today to

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:51.400
put some of that stuff away and lock it up
safely.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.880
Thank you very much.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:11:02.290
It was always going to be very, very difficult
for Russia, a weak state, to accept the hand

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:04.370
of a rich United States after the Cold War.

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:08.520
There's no question that there was an asymmetry
here in feelings.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.970
We felt we sort of came out on top, and we’d
like to help you.

01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:18.730
And Russians felt: “We are weak; we are
down on our heels; we're on our backs.

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:21.040
And yet we want to feel strong.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.970
If you're offering us a hand of help with
democracy and you're offering us how to build

01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:31.110
capital markets and you're building warehouses
to store our nuclear weapons, then what are

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:32.110
we?

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:33.110
Is this charity?

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:34.110
Are we children?

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.580
You know, we want to be grown up with you.”

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:42.710
I met Russian scientists who were very grateful
that George Soros had provided them very tiny

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:48.520
subsistence grants for buying food in the
early years, but they ultimately said to me:

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:53.350
“You know, we're very grateful that you
want to do projects with us, but we want to

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:54.350
do science.

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:55.350
We would like respect.”

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.360
It wasn't only Putin.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:04.060
A lot of people in the country, they had trouble
accepting the extended hand of the United

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.060
States.

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:12.160
I think many Americans extended the hand with
good basic ideals but without understanding

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.470
that it might be humiliating; it might be
hard.

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:23.121
Putin himself could not understand that all
this activity, both NATO expansion, democracy

01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:27.970
promotion, everything going on around him,
wasn’t intended to overthrow him.

01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:30.730
It wasn’t intended to tear Russia to pieces.

01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:35.550
MICHAEL KIRK - But if you're canny like Putin
obviously is, and kind of street-smart, you

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:42.410
know the outside enemy is valuable to you
as you promise security, growth, respect to

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:44.860
a population that feels just as you've described
them.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.680
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - But here's the thing.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.780
Putin was delivering on growth, and he was
delivering on the economic promise in his

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.780
first two terms.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.780
MICHAEL KIRK - Because of the oil?

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.250
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Oil prices went up and
up and up.

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.900
Real wages went up 400 percent.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.480
The oil price went up 10 times over a decade.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.810
So in many ways at home, Putin was delivering
the economic part of that promise.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:16.250
To some people, that felt like stability compared
to the wild freedom of the Yeltsin years.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:19.000
And Putin created a promise.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.310
Putin created a kind of tacit pact with his
people.

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:28.160
It went like this: “I will provide prosperity.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.020
You see it all around you.

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.310
Wages are rising; everybody’s going to work
now.

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:35.950
You will stay out of politics.

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:38.790
You will not vote for people that will compete
with me.

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:41.330
There will not be any competition to me.”

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:43.230
This was a tacit understanding.

01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:44.540
And there's another part of it.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.940
He said, “I will stay out of your personal
lives.”

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:52.300
And this was a very important part of the
Soviet KGB repression.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:55.570
MICHAEL KIRK - And now, this is where I want
to go next, is—

01:13:55.570 --> 01:13:56.570
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Is Munich?

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:58.290
MICHAEL KIRK - Munich, exactly.

01:13:58.290 --> 01:13:59.290
So that’s where we go.

01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:02.150
So he’s got it kind of calmed down at home
now.

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:05.420
It’s taken him seven years to do it, but
he’s got it, more or less, thanks to oil

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.790
and lots of other things.

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:13.280
What is the meaning of him stepping up on
that stage?

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.380
First, why does he go?

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.950
It’s rare that a leader goes, but why does
he go, and what is that about?

01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:22.440
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I don't know why he went.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.850
But if you read the Munich speech, it was
shocking to everybody.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:31.240
The speech in Munich was a cry, and I think
there are signs of this percolating in the

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.860
2000s, maybe signs that were missed.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:41.031
After Beslan, when he gave that speech worrying
about parts of Russia being torn off, there

01:14:41.031 --> 01:14:48.180
is a way in which Putin exploits and takes
advantage of the disenchantment by Russians

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.780
about the West, about democracy.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.390
He plays on it.

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:57.910
And this is a speech that really says to the
United States, “You are messing up as the

01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:58.910
world’s superpower.”

01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:59.910
...

01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:09.070
It’s a very, very pained complaint about
the actions of what he sees as a global superpower.

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:13.050
He wants to create a world in which there
will be multiple powers, multiple poles of

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:16.710
power, multiple centers in which Russia will
be one of them.

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:23.910
It’s not at the time, but the Iraq War and
certainly the things that Putin had been seeing

01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:29.340
going on in the former Soviet Union and the
outlying republics, the color revolutions,

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:36.330
had just caused him so much anxiety that it
boiled over in this speech that was very vaguely

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:37.410
sort of paranoia.

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:44.010
You know, it was worry about the fact that
this Goliath was tromping around the globe.

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:47.420
It was way over the top.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:53.100
It didn't track at all with the reality of
that period.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:59.220
The United States actually had suffered a
lot of difficulties in Iraq, and it was still

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.680
a period when the war was very intense.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:08.310
But in this, you see Putin’s deep-seated
fear of the United States and his feeling

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:13.750
that the United States is a global hyperpower
that can do anything it wants.

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.180
That's what he most despises.

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:20.480
MICHAEL KIRK - It feels also to me … like
the period you've described up to this moment,

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:26.830
and now talking to the ambassadors and the
State Department people and others who know,

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:33.110
they say it’s almost like a declaration
of war, overstating it.

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:41.660
But the next period, many of the things that
he does—changing his military, strengthening

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:54.310
certain parts of it, the Estonia moment, the
next go-around with the color revolutions—all

01:16:54.310 --> 01:17:01.280
of it is like in a way he’s practicing for
this asymmetrical different kind of war.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.280
…

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:10.000
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - This Putin is becoming
a very, very deeply suspicious and angry guy

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:17.140
that's thinking about asymmetric measures
he can use to carry out some of that pent-up

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.140
feeling.

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:25.540
And the cyberattack on Estonia, the short,
brief war with Georgia, the Munich speech,

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:29.990
all come together, and he’s testing.

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:35.580
Also with the oil revenues, starting to build
and investing and starting to think about

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:40.980
what we need as a new military if we're going
to continue to exert ourselves and if we're

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.520
going to continue to try and push back.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.200
MICHAEL KIRK - Great.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:54.580
And into that world walks Barack Hussein Obama
and Hillary Rodham Clinton with a reset in

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.580
mind.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:01.570
Do they have any idea, in the first place,
what he’s doing?

01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:07.690
Do they have a real sense, do you think, these
ambassadors and others who have been watching

01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:14.970
it all, of just how pernicious things could
get and what he’s really thinking about?

01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:20.730
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - You know, I don't know
for sure.

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:34.930
But I think that by 2008, when Bush leaves
office, he and Putin have exhausted the relationship.

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:37.390
Putin’s fed up with him.

01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:39.600
He felt like Bush didn't listen to him.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.210
And frankly, Bush sort of saw Putin as a nuisance
by that time.

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:51.960
The entire history of our relations with Russia
have been these cycles of distrust, cycles

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.080
of mistrust and misperception.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.580
It happens throughout the Cold War.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:02.500
I think to some extent, the people who came
in with Obama thought some of this isn't really

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.500
necessary.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.020
We have things we want to do with Russia,
and if we can just get to some of the things

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.960
we need to do, maybe we can engage them.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.690
Obama was very committed to reducing nuclear
weapons.

01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:18.020
Obama was very committed to trying to reduce
nuclear weapons, and he felt like that was

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.840
an important piece of business he could do
with Putin.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.570
So the Obama people came in, and the idea
of the reset was let’s see if there are

01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:31.910
a few places where we can engage.

01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:37.130
I think that they felt confident in their
own abilities to do that, that maybe what

01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:42.550
had gone wrong was just that Bush and Putin
had exhausted each other in mistrust and they

01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:47.530
could start over to find some places where
they could get a deal.

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:50.480
Putin was leaving office.

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:57.670
Putin decided not to break the Russian constitution,
and he turned it over to this younger guy,

01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:01.460
a guy who seemed more progressive, Dmitry
Medvedev.

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:09.460
And Medvedev gave off a vibe of really getting
the modernization thing, so Obama’s calculations

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:15.830
that maybe we can do some business with Russia
were fueled by the hope that Medvedev would

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:17.150
be a partner.

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:22.210
Now, there was a lot of uncertainty about
whether Medvedev and Putin were in a tandem.

01:20:22.210 --> 01:20:27.340
I mean, were these guys riding the same bicycle,
or were they actually riding separate bicycles?

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:32.950
Was it possible that Putin would fade and
Medvedev would be a guy that the United States

01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:34.680
could do a lot of business with?

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:41.490
I think that people forget that nuclear arms
treaty that was negotiated in that time successfully

01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:44.770
with Russia and with Medvedev and [was] signed.

01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:46.280
There were things that could be done.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:54.520
But the Medvedev illusion was something that
was hard for a lot of people to see, that

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.510
he was actually the front man for Putin.

01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:01.680
I think there was a lot of debate in that
time, including in the Intelligence Community

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.670
and in the White House, about who was really
pulling the strings.

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:10.020
The hope was that it was Medvedev, and the
fear was that it was Putin.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:21.530
MICHAEL KIRK - And into this world of uncertainty,
things begin to happen in the world: Arab

01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:28.240
Spring; another ruler thrown under the bus,
or falls out; Libya.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.660
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Also there's one other
thing.

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:37.120
Obama’s trying to work this, and the nuclear
arms agreement is a high priority, and he

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.270
gets it done, and Medvedev’s there.

01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:44.530
Medvedev also is again showing signs of being
the not-Putin.

01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:49.110
He begins to make some changes to the hard-edged
things that Putin had done.

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:50.910
Medvedev comes to Palo Alto.

01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:52.770
He goes to Silicon Valley.

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:57.750
He talks about high tech; he plays with an
iPad; he wears jeans.

01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:05.840
There was also a very quiet Obama imperative,
which is that we were winding down in Afghanistan,

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.690
and the United States had a desperate need
for a way to get all the gear and stuff out

01:22:11.690 --> 01:22:19.110
of Afghanistan and couldn’t take it through
Pakistan.

01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:23.900
They negotiated with Russia a rail line called
the Northern Distribution Network, which was

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:27.940
a vital way, which Russia proved for many
years.

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:34.870
It was kept very quiet, but huge trains rolled
through the Russian countryside to help us

01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:38.230
get out of Afghanistan.

01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:43.400
You know, it wasn't the kind of thing that
at the time people boasted about, but Obama

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:49.170
felt if we can just laser-like choose a few
things we want to get done, and if we deal

01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:53.720
with this guy, Medvedev, who seems pretty
normal, things are going to be OK.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.250
MICHAEL KIRK - Of course it wasn’t going
to last.

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.400
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - That's 2010.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.140
MICHAEL KIRK - Yeah, ’10 and ’11.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:05.170
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - So what happens in 2011
is that the ancient regime in the Middle East

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.170
is overthrown.

01:23:06.170 --> 01:23:15.530
I mean, from Tahrir Square to when the Arab
Spring breaks out echoes across the world

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:21.410
and especially in Russia, because, again,
Putin has already seen color revolutions within

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:27.580
the former Soviet Union; he’s seen the power
of these massive crowds.

01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:34.560
He missed the entire period like this in the
Soviet Union when Gorbachev was loosening

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:35.790
the reins.

01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:39.790
For him, this was an existential kind of a
moment.

01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:45.620
And somebody like Hosni Mubarak [of Egypt]
who was overthrown at the first start of that,

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:51.690
was not too much different than Vladimir Putin
in the sense of a soft authoritarianism, a

01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:57.120
very, very complex society where the leader
is trying to keep the lid on everything.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:03.010
I think that particularly for Putin, what
happened in Egypt was something that really

01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:04.700
went right to his heart.

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:11.990
And I think Russians spend a lot of time traveling
to Egypt, and certainly what happened in Iraq—then

01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:17.510
to see it spread like this, I think Putin
must always be asking himself: “Where does

01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:18.510
it end?

01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:20.850
And what is the legitimacy of these people?”

01:24:20.850 --> 01:24:26.480
He has no understanding that democracy and
people—that people sort of exerting their

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.660
own will in the rule of a country is important.

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:35.480
… So the Arab Spring in the first half of
2011 unsettles him, and also Medvedev’s

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.190
term is ending.

01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:43.000
In late 2011, they’ve got to decide, really,
will Medvedev run for president again?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.390
He could have another term, or will Putin
return?

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:52.780
And of course this is a guessing game that
preoccupied Moscow for that period of middle

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.710
of 2011.

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:58.230
There was a lot of open speculation in the
press.

01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:00.720
People were weighing up each camp, each side.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.770
It almost sort of felt normal, but there was
a great deal of uncertainty.

01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:10.570
People really—no one had an inside bead
about how this was going to unfold.

01:25:10.570 --> 01:25:15.080
So there was a very, very big meeting of the
United Russia Party.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.060
This party is the party that Putin created.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:21.600
It’s a party that's filled with bureaucrats.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.200
Everybody who’s gotten a good job in the
Putin years is part of this party.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.980
And they have an enormous rally.

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:32.541
It's in a sports stadium, Luzhniki Stadium,
the biggest stadium in Moscow, and there's

01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:38.060
a sort of gentle breeze rolling across, and
people are basically holding their breath

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:43.300
as this moment nears when the announcement
is made.

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:51.870
Medvedev, looking rather tired and a strangely
not very perky Medvedev, basically announces

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:58.970
that Putin is going to return to the presidency,
that they're going to swap jobs, and Medvedev

01:25:58.970 --> 01:26:01.680
will go back to being prime minister.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:08.700
Of course this is greeted with the requisite
sort of clapping and so on from their people,

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:15.060
because these are the people they’ve brought,
but I think at that moment, there was a complete

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:19.090
lack of realization by Putin about what was
going to happen next.

01:26:19.090 --> 01:26:24.920
MICHAEL KIRK - Are people watching it on TV
and bars and stuff?

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:29.640
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - David Hoffman was live
on Ekho Moskvy Radio at that very moment when

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.250
the guy who’s the founder of Ekho Moskvy
was interviewing me.

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:38.430
Then he saw the announcement, and he goes
like this and pushed me off to the side and

01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:41.310
said, “I've got to go live,” And he starts
his commentary.

01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:42.310
...

01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:45.660
I mean, people thought it was just going to
be another boring United Russia convention,

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:52.580
and this thing riveted everybody, but in a
way that Putin and Medvedev didn’t understand.

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:58.970
The reaction to this was quiet at first, but
a lot of people, especially millennials and

01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:03.850
the Moscow, the urban elite, the people that
had done very well in Putin’s time—this

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:05.440
is 2011.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.360
You know, there's been 11 years of this.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.410
There was a few speed bumps with the recession
and so on, but still people have done well.

01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:16.750
There was a feeling that they were cheated.

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:20.570
People began to ask themselves in the kitchen:
“This is a democracy.

01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:23.240
Aren’t we supposed to decide?”

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:29.310
There was a way in which the job trade sort
of irritated people, and it got worse, because

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:34.650
both Putin and Medvedev said shortly thereafter,
“Here's how it came down.”

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:38.490
And one of them, I forgot which one of them,
said, “Yeah, we just were talking last night,

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:39.490
and we decided.”

01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:43.430
And the other said, “We've been planning
it this way for years.”

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:48.290
The fact that they couldn’t even get their
story straight on having cheated the electorate

01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:51.580
began to really piss people off.

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:57.510
Coming shortly after this in December was
a parliamentary election.

01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:04.240
In the parliamentary election, at this point,
the voter monitoring had really zoomed ahead

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.330
in Russia.

01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:10.160
First of all, there was a group called GOLOS,
which was beneficiary of grants from the United

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.620
States, which was involved with essentially
making sure that elections were free and fair.

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:20.180
This is the kind of thing the United States
did everywhere, grants to help these election-monitoring

01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:24.450
groups because we felt free and fair elections
are part of our value set.

01:28:24.450 --> 01:28:30.300
We had no reluctance to push this idea of
free and fair elections everywhere.

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:37.560
But it also turned out that there's huge change
in the way people monitored elections because

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.710
of the digital revolution.

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:44.880
Smartphones had created a device that could
capture anything happening in public spaces

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.490
and share it almost instantly.

01:28:47.490 --> 01:28:49.700
Moscow and Russia has become very wired.

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.520
It’s very easy to share photographs.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.260
What happened in that period, in the run-up
to the parliamentary election, was that people

01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:01.930
had set out to start monitoring elections,
and certainly as the election happened on

01:29:01.930 --> 01:29:06.470
that day discovered that there was an enormous
amount of fraud.

01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:11.940
One of the most obvious frauds was using this
thing called a carousel in which basically

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:17.710
voters are driven in a school bus from voting
place to voting place to stuff the ballot

01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:19.470
box over and over again.

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:23.670
This was caught by people holding their smartphones.

01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:25.800
This video began to circulate.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.021
The idea that they cheated again, that they
cheated us, that they not only decided who’s

01:29:30.021 --> 01:29:36.220
going to run the country but that they're
stuffing the ballot boxes, set off a conflagration.

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.590
It was a match that changed the world.

01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:43.540
It hit the floor, and by the next day, demonstrations
began.

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:48.910
The first demonstration was thought up by
a couple of guys who were really angry about

01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:53.940
this, young people who had come to Moscow
looking for better fortune.

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.980
And they were sitting around thinking, how
are we going to express this?

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:59.700
And they said, “We’ve got to do something;
we’ve got to protest.”

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:06.320
So, opening their MacBook Pros on kitchen
counter they had bought from Ikea in Moscow,

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:12.920
they went on to Facebook, and they put up
an RSVP button for a demonstration.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.650
And this kind of thing, that RSVP button,
gave rise to one of the biggest protests,

01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:23.210
and then another one, and finally, the huge
protest in Bolotnaya right outside the walls

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:26.210
of the Kremlin in December.

01:30:26.210 --> 01:30:29.620
This really shook Putin to his roots.

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:32.270
People were standing out there.

01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:41.320
The really best of his years, people that
had prospered, people that had come into Moscow

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:47.080
for good jobs, the urban elite, and they're
holding signs that say “Russia without Putin.”

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.080
...

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.520
JIM GILMORE - Sochi.

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:57.010
Talk a little bit about what it represented
for Putin and the fact that lurking in the

01:30:57.010 --> 01:30:58.120
background was Ukraine.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:02.040
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Sochi was a huge triumph
for Putin.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:07.820
There had been a lot of tension around the
Winter Games because they were held in a part

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:12.020
of Russia in the south, near restive republics
like Chechnya.

01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:15.800
There was a great deal of worry that there
might be a terrorist attack.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:19.490
The games came off, and they were peaceful.

01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:25.170
Also, for Putin, it was a huge demonstration
that Russia was a normal country.

01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:28.060
He had all the world’s leaders there.

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:30.630
Everything happened like it should in Olympic
Games.

01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:33.060
It was a real moment of triumph for Putin.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:39.820
Before Sochi, the president of Ukraine, [Viktor]
Yanukovych, was planning to sign an agreement

01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:43.150
with the European Union, an association agreement.

01:31:43.150 --> 01:31:50.350
This would give Ukraine access to huge markets
in Europe, fresh foreign investment, and it

01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:53.650
would essentially bring Ukraine toward Europe.

01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:56.410
But Putin did not want to see this happen.

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.490
He met with Yanukovych in November.

01:31:58.490 --> 01:32:00.490
They had a secret meeting at the airport.

01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:07.120
A short while later, Yanukovych put the European
agreement on ice.

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:16.300
A few weeks after that, Putin dangled a real
big aid package for Ukraine, $15 billion,

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:21.010
a big cut in natural gas prices, which was
really important for Ukraine.

01:32:21.010 --> 01:32:28.310
Putin was holding out the idea that Yanukovych
could join this Eurasian Economic Union that

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:34.080
was a real goal of Putin, that he had talked
about often, the idea that these Eurasian

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:39.140
countries, former Soviet Republics, would
all bond together.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:45.220
This switch that Yanukovych made, putting
the Europeans on ice and considering this

01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:54.770
offer of a big aid package from Russia, really
enraged the Ukrainian street, and really,

01:32:54.770 --> 01:33:00.660
only a short while after Yanukovych indicated
that he might sign that deal, might approve

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.510
that deal, that protests began.

01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:11.040
The first Sunday afterward, 100,000 people
were out in the streets of Kiev, and soon

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.391
protests got bigger and bigger.

01:33:13.391 --> 01:33:20.440
By the time that the Olympics were nearing
an end in February, huge demonstrations were

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:27.350
taking place in Ukraine against this move
to make a deal with Russia and not with Europe.

01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:32.100
I think this speaks first of all to the fact
that a lot of people in Ukraine saw their

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:34.640
future with Europe and not with Russia.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:40.380
But it hadn’t really been a burning issue
until this choice had been made between European

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:45.940
agreement, access to these huge European markets
and foreign investment, and the Russia offer

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.590
of an aid package.

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:51.490
And Yanukovych was a friend of the Kremlin.

01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:55.450
He was a pro-Russian leader of pro-Russian
groups.

01:33:55.450 --> 01:34:04.340
He had been a provincial leader in Donetsk,
the part of Ukraine with a big Russian-speaking

01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:05.630
population.

01:34:05.630 --> 01:34:09.180
He considered himself an ally of Putin and
the Kremlin.

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:15.080
And as these demonstrations grew in the streets
of Ukraine, in Independence Square, the Maidan

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:21.150
movement was born in reaction to this switch
he wanted to make, and as these demonstrations

01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:23.570
grew, he couldn’t manage them.

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:24.730
There was violence.

01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:31.150
Finally, when Yanukovych fled his country,
he just up and left amid all of this violence.

01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:32.830
He abandoned Ukraine.

01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:38.320
So Putin, right after Sochi, right as the
games were concluding, suddenly has a crisis

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.320
on his hands.

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.820
He’s just come off such a sweet triumph
of the Olympics, and now he’s looking just

01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:50.230
beyond the horizon, and there is a boiling
cauldron in Ukraine.

01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:55.520
His guy, who was the president of Ukraine,
has fled, and it looks like Ukraine might

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.230
be lost to him.

01:34:57.230 --> 01:35:07.330
That would be a terrible, terrible setback
for Putin, because he believed that Ukraine

01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:11.840
was part of a sphere of influence that was
rightly Russia’s.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:16.300
… For Putin, this thing is a real threat
on several levels, OK?

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:22.900
On the big level, Putin still is bitter about
the enlargement of NATO in the 1990s.

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:27.770
He is still bitter about the idea that Ukraine
is having a dalliance with Europe, with the

01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:29.010
European Union.

01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:35.110
So, on a large level, conceptual level, this
is taking an apple right out of his mouth.

01:35:35.110 --> 01:35:39.030
But it’s also very, very tactical and very
specific.

01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:45.640
After his ally Yanukovych flees the country,
a new leadership takes charge in Ukraine,

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.460
and they're very pro-European.

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.880
They don’t want to make the deal with Putin.

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.670
They don’t want the $15 billion aid package.

01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:57.460
They want to make that agreement with the
European Union, the association agreement

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:58.780
that was set aside.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:04.360
Putin sees a possibility that Ukraine may
suddenly be led by forces that are going the

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:09.230
other way, that he could lose control of Ukraine,
and that would mean losing a piece of his

01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:15.820
sphere of influence, a sphere that the President
Medvedev, a few years earlier, had described

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:18.880
as part of Russia’s particular interest.

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.860
I think that Putin felt that this part of
the former Soviet Union was being pulled away

01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:26.720
from him, and that was a real threat.

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:29.760
JIM GILMORE - So Crimea.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.810
How do we get to the attack on Crimea, and
why?

01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:39.030
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - In the middle of this crisis,
I think Putin had very, very little time to

01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:44.570
make decisions about how to respond to what
had happened in the Maidan movement, the huge

01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:48.980
demonstrations, the loss of a pro-Russian
president of Ukraine.

01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:54.010
And I think that in the moment, when he had
to decide what to do, Crimea looked like a

01:36:54.010 --> 01:36:59.090
quick way that he could reassert some authority
over Ukraine.

01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:00.900
Crimea had once been part of Russia.

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.920
It was moved to Ukraine in Soviet times.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:09.060
There was a big Russian-speaking population
there, a big naval base there, and I think

01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:15.820
that what Putin thought was, if we can just
grab Crimea, maybe we’ll shock some of those

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:21.570
people; maybe we’ll set some chills go running
through the backbone of the people in Ukraine

01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:24.080
and show them that we haven't given up.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:30.770
So he organized an effort to seize Crimea
from Ukraine using soldiers without markings

01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:33.960
on their uniforms, the so-called little green
men.

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.920
It happened very swiftly.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:41.330
And these special operations forces moved
in with—there was no bloodshed—and essentially

01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:45.880
seized Crimea from Ukraine at the time of
all this chaos.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.870
Of course this was very, very popular inside
of Russia.

01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:55.260
Again, Putin was reacting to a crisis that
threatened him, a crisis that threatened Russia

01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:59.960
in Ukraine, with losing a really important
part of their sphere of influence.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.880
So essentially, it was a counterpoint, a brief
one.

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:07.531
JIM GILMORE - Essentially was what?

01:38:07.531 --> 01:38:08.531
And explain what you mean.

01:38:08.531 --> 01:38:13.750
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - It was a brief way, tactically,
to change the dynamics of the crisis, because

01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:18.940
by seizing Crimea, there was a real surge
of popular support inside of Russia.

01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:23.111
And Putin, instead of looking like a loser
who was losing Ukraine, would look like a

01:38:23.111 --> 01:38:29.070
winner who had just brought Crimea, historically
part of Russia, back to the fold.

01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:30.070
...

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:34.150
One of the really notable things about the
seizure and annexation of Crimea was that

01:38:34.150 --> 01:38:39.970
the Russian media staged a really fierce propaganda
campaign to reinforce how this was a great

01:38:39.970 --> 01:38:42.060
triumph for Russia.

01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:49.190
This kind of propaganda, using television,
social media, not only had a big impact inside

01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:54.950
of Russia, but also showed how Putin could
begin to blend various methods of unmarked

01:38:54.950 --> 01:39:02.590
special operations forces and social media
and television broadcasts to create this new

01:39:02.590 --> 01:39:04.560
thing, this hybrid warfare.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.250
JIM GILMORE - Great.

01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:14.630
The [Victoria] Nuland phone hack, and using
it, and using her, and how Putin manipulates

01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:21.680
that or why he uses that tactic, instead of
just, as in the past, gathering intelligence.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.700
Now they were leaking the intelligence as
well.

01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:27.930
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - … In the thick of this
crisis, the assistant secretary of state for

01:39:27.930 --> 01:39:35.190
Europe, Victoria Nuland, had a telephone conversation
with the American ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey

01:39:35.190 --> 01:39:36.190
Pyatt.

01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:40.010
Pyatt was apparently using a normal cell phone.

01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:45.410
It wasn’t encrypted, so the conversation
was recorded, and in the conversation Nuland

01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:52.150
expressed real frustration with Europe over
the whole crisis with—she curses the European

01:39:52.150 --> 01:39:53.150
Union.

01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:55.660
… That certainly reflected the deep frustrations
that she felt.

01:39:55.660 --> 01:40:00.950
But the other thing that happened in the phone
call is that she and the ambassador had a

01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:05.940
discussion about who would be best to serve
in this new government in Ukraine.

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:11.130
They had a discussion about specific ministries
and who should be in what ministry.

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:16.660
So when the phone call was monitored or taped
or surveilled by somebody, and we don’t

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:23.400
know who, it was incendiary, because obviously,
when Putin saw that the Americans were having

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:28.980
this discussion about who should be what minister
in Ukraine, it may well have confirmed to

01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:36.510
him his deep-seated paranoia that the Americans
were actually behind the whole revolt in the

01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:41.690
Maidan, that the whole thing was a Western
plot, that it was another color revolution

01:40:41.690 --> 01:40:45.840
that was really being manipulated behind the
scenes by the Americans.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:51.820
So the phone call, which had been recorded
surreptitiously, was suddenly appearing twice

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:52.820
on YouTube.

01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.000
It was just uploaded there.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.130
Not too many people saw it for the first few
days, and then a certain blogger put it up,

01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:03.210
and it just went viral.

01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:05.130
It just took off like wildfire.

01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:08.000
People started downloading it, listening,
discussing it.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.360
This was a way, without any fingerprints,
for Putin to sort of weaponize the information

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.220
he had gotten from this wiretap.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:22.610
Somebody, we don’t know who, without any
fingerprints, uploaded this information—uploaded

01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:27.570
this phone call to YouTube, and suddenly it
went viral.

01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:30.220
Millions and millions of people heard this
phone conversation.

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:34.260
Then the Russian media began to carry this
everywhere, saying: “You see?

01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:38.610
It’s proof the Maidan movement, it’s not
an independence movement.

01:41:38.610 --> 01:41:39.980
It’s the Americans.

01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.570
They're running the show behind the scenes.

01:41:42.570 --> 01:41:46.340
This is the Americans behind the scenes, causing
the whole thing to happen.”

01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:49.470
It was an example of weaponizing information.

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:55.780
JIM GILMORE - Talk a little bit about the
way Putin lies about the little green men

01:41:55.780 --> 01:42:06.520
in Crimea, how he is able to accomplish his
goals and then hide the facts, and why would

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.050
he do that.

01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:12.880
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - The Crimea operation was
very swift.

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:20.090
And the special forces that were sent in,
the soldiers without insignia, allowed Russia

01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:22.710
to sort of say, “Who, me?”

01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:26.760
The soldiers were sent in without insignia,
silently, to take control, to seize control

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:31.920
of this territory; were able to do so by creating
confusion.

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.340
People didn’t know at first glance who they
were.

01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:37.090
What did they represent?

01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:38.640
What power was taking over?

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:45.780
And this, of course, was deceptive and subversive
and allowed Russia to get away with this for

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:48.170
a while, before anyone could object.

01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:53.640
By the time it was discovered who was really
behind it, which was not many days later,

01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.690
Crimea had already been seized.

01:42:55.690 --> 01:43:01.051
This was the use of deception in order to
accomplish a military goal, and it’s another

01:43:01.051 --> 01:43:07.510
example of what is being called hybrid warfare,
which is to use all the things at your disposal,

01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:12.190
both real military force and information warfare,
to accomplish your goals.

01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:13.190
…

01:43:13.190 --> 01:43:16.840
JIM GILMORE - ... The fact that the world
was being lied to about what was actually

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:22.510
taking place, how did it stymie Obama in a
way in acting?

01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:30.170
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - If it was murky about who
were these little green men, it would be lot

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:31.260
harder to protest.

01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:35.400
It would be a lot harder to stage a swift
response.

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.900
It would certainly make it much more difficult
for the West to put their arms around the

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.010
nature of the problem.

01:43:41.010 --> 01:43:44.790
It would make it much more difficult for the
West to react quickly.

01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:49.370
It would make it a lot harder for the White
House and for the West to react quickly if

01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:52.470
it was murky who was carrying out the invasion.

01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:58.660
JIM GILMORE - And that’s—for Obama, he’s
sort of in a quandary of how to act?

01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:00.250
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - You know, Jim, I just don’t
know the answer to this question.

01:44:00.250 --> 01:44:03.480
I just—I mean, it’s just not something
that I'm up on.

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:13.900
JIM GILMORE - So the taking of Crimea without
being stopped by the West, without the West

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:21.760
sort of raising the red flags in some way,
how did that embolden Putin?

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:29.010
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I think what the taking
of Crimea did was to lead to the very next

01:44:29.010 --> 01:44:30.840
stage, OK.

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:35.940
First of all, when Crimea was taken, the Maidan
movement didn’t stop.

01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:41.750
The movement in Ukraine, the demonstrations
and the movement toward Europe was not arrested.

01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:43.790
It was not stopped all of a sudden.

01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:48.140
Putin still had a very big problem, which
is that, by taking Ukraine, he’d even pissed

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.610
off the Ukrainians even more.

01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:54.880
The movement toward Europe was accelerating,
so he had to do something else.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:00.030
I think Putin then reached into a toolbox
that had been used elsewhere, and that toolbox

01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:08.000
partially was reflected in the Crimea operation,
which was to try and create a military conflict

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:14.610
or ethnic or civil conflict, and create just
enough of it to cause everybody to gasp and

01:45:14.610 --> 01:45:16.700
to stop and to freeze.

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:25.820
I think that Putin created a war in southeastern
Ukraine in two provinces by stirring it up,

01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:32.980
by importing fighters, by essentially challenging
Ukraine militarily, and he did that in order

01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:37.620
to undermine what he saw happening in the
capital, the movement toward Europe.

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:42.430
He did it to sort of challenge Ukraine’s
sovereignty, and for a while, even to threaten

01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:48.240
it, because he also massed regular forces
on the border with Ukraine, massing them inside

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:50.440
Russia, on the border with Ukraine.

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.470
He sent irregular fighters in to start an
insurrection in Ukraine.

01:45:55.470 --> 01:46:03.020
You know, this tactic of using these irregular
fighters and separatists had been done elsewhere

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:07.840
to create frozen conflicts in which Putin
had tried to accomplish goals, and frankly,

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.090
it had even been done before his time.

01:46:10.090 --> 01:46:17.260
But if you look at Transnistria and South
Ossetia, and Abkhazia, each of these conflicts

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:23.760
was similar, frozen conflict, unresolved,
but a way for Russia to continue to have a

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.540
little bit of influence.

01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:32.491
I think that what we saw in Ukraine was, Putin
seized Crimea, but the crisis continued, so

01:46:32.491 --> 01:46:38.130
he decided to roll the dice on an even bigger
intervention, this time to start a war in

01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:40.460
southeastern Ukraine.

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:47.000
This war, again, at first, people said—Putin
said this war was being started by indigenous

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.080
separatists, by people who were there, who
wanted to be free of this new Ukraine.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:59.210
He talked about—Russia created this narrative
that the revolt in the Maidan was actually

01:46:59.210 --> 01:47:06.480
being fueled by the West or by, you know,
crazy Ukrainian nationalists or by fascists.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.480
They created a whole story about it.

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:15.070
But in fact, this was the revolt of people
who, on the street, who wanted an association,

01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:17.000
wanted to be part of Europe.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.870
Putin, in starting this war in Ukraine, didn’t
fess up to what he was doing.

01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:23.630
He used deception.

01:47:23.630 --> 01:47:30.740
He used subversion again and didn’t admit,
at first, that these people who were shooting

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:35.460
their way into Ukraine were actually being
paid for and instigated by him.

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.460
…

01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.580
JIM GILMORE - ... What is hybrid war?

01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:45.220
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - In 2013, the chief of the
Russian military’s general staff, Gen. [Valery]

01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:50.100
Gerasimov, wrote an article sort of looking
ahead and what would future war look like,

01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.390
and he described what he called a hybrid war.

01:47:53.390 --> 01:48:00.100
It was really actually a look ahead at what
the Russian military thought the West would

01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:03.040
do in a future war and how to get prepared.

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.920
But it was very revealing, because it also
showed what Russia’s thinking was, about

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:12.090
how future wars would be conducted.

01:48:12.090 --> 01:48:15.850
Hybrid war in this context was a big, broad
category.

01:48:15.850 --> 01:48:21.420
It meant, first of all, that there might not
be a declaration of war, that hostilities

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:24.710
in war might happen without a declaration.

01:48:24.710 --> 01:48:28.880
It might be that there would be no longer
red and blue forces on a battlefield.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:34.220
There might not be such clear distinctions;
that there might be a mixture of military

01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:38.880
and civilian and irregular forces all blended
up.

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.910
Most importantly, it also suggested that the
future of war would be a place not only where

01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:48.540
people are actually shooting and bombing,
what's called kinetic warfare, but also there

01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:53.290
would be information warfare, cyberwarfare,
non-kinetic.

01:48:53.290 --> 01:48:58.170
Or there would be information warfare and
cyberwarfare, and these would complement and

01:48:58.170 --> 01:49:05.020
mix in with the regular kinetic warfare so
that this future of warfare might be the kind

01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:09.420
of time when there actually wouldn’t be
a hard start to a war, and there wouldn’t

01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:16.230
be a finish; when there would be not necessarily
a clearly defined troops and forces; when

01:49:16.230 --> 01:49:18.940
there would be confusion on the battlefield.

01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:24.470
The idea, really, of hybrid war was to create
this confusion, and to create as much confusion

01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:27.300
as you needed to win the war.

01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:32.780
There was a lot of talk in Russia about the
idea of a chaos button that you could press

01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:41.060
or that you could turn that would manipulate
the kind of disruption and chaos that you’d

01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:42.780
get on the battlefield.

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:48.010
This whole idea that future warfare would
involve marshaling all these different forces,

01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:53.660
and that then you could control how much,
whether it was disinformation one day or an

01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:59.960
attack by irregulars another day, that then
you would use, for example, media to try and

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:05.300
create confusion about what would happen on
the battlefield, that was also part of hybrid

01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:06.300
war.

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:12.550
So all the clear distinctions that we've known
in the past about warfare were to be blurred,

01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:19.830
and [we had reached] a time in which the digital
revolution and the Internet and social media

01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:24.200
had created huge new opportunities for this
kind of warfare.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.200
…

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:30.130
JIM GILMORE - In Washington, there's a debate
over what to do, about whether we should be

01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:31.300
sending weaponry.

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:39.030
… Talk a little bit about the debate in
Washington and where Obama ends up.

01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:47.820
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - What Putin did in southeastern
Ukraine was to ignite a war, to set off an

01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:50.990
insurrection, where it had previously been
rather calm.

01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:55.630
I think that this caught Washington off guard,
because this kind of thing hadn’t happened

01:50:55.630 --> 01:50:56.870
in decades.

01:50:56.870 --> 01:51:04.110
This was really an effort to redraw the borders
of post-World War II Europe in a forceful

01:51:04.110 --> 01:51:05.110
way.

01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:10.090
It took a while for Obama and for the administration,
for the United States, to come to grips with

01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:11.710
what Putin was doing.

01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:15.930
He had done it in a few other places earlier
inside the former Soviet Union.

01:51:15.930 --> 01:51:21.760
But first of all, you just can't underestimate
how this was a shock to Washington.

01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:26.700
Of course the first reaction of a lot of people
was that Putin only understands the use of

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:33.461
force, that Putin only understands strength,
and in order to push back, it would be essential

01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:38.500
for the United States and for the West to
supply arms to Ukraine.

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:43.480
There was a certain logic here, because Putin
is, by his own record, is the kind of guy

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.600
who only responds to force.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.880
He certainly doesn’t respond a lot to jawboning.

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:55.430
And during this time, Secretary of State Kerry
talked about whether Putin could be talked

01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:58.000
into taking the “off ramp” in Ukraine.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.200
Well, there was no “off ramp” that Putin
was going to take in Ukraine.

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:08.970
The idea of arming Ukraine, of really providing
things like anti-tank weapons, lethal weapons

01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:14.920
for Ukraine, would be essentially [to] meet
fire with fire and hopefully stop Putin in

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.950
his tracks.

01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:22.400
But the flipside of this, which I think was
not only heard in Washington but also among

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:27.380
people elsewhere, is that there was a real
danger that if the United States escalated

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:32.340
this, that Putin would escalate, too, and
that it would just essentially lead immediately

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:37.300
to a full-fledged war in Ukraine, and would
that be the right thing for Ukraine?

01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:39.010
What would that do to Ukraine?

01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:44.320
How would that help Ukraine realize its aspirations
to be part of Europe?

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.450
And was it really worth it?

01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:53.150
And since this was a part of the former Soviet
Union, did we really want to be at war with

01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:56.360
Russia on territory of the former Soviet Union?

01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.570
Was that in American national interest?

01:52:58.570 --> 01:53:01.570
Was that worthy of blood and treasure?

01:53:01.570 --> 01:53:05.640
You know, there's definitely kind of a post-Iraq
syndrome in Washington.

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:11.070
There is a lot more caution about the use
of force these days, I think, and definitely

01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:17.030
President Obama felt that caution and was
very, very conservative in his use of force.

01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:23.860
I think he looked at this and felt that arming
Ukraine in this battle with Russia would probably

01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:27.110
simply lead to a wider war that he wanted
to avoid.

01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:28.110
…

01:53:28.110 --> 01:53:35.280
JIM GILMORE - The hacking of the DNC, the
eventual hacking of Podesta as of March, then

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:41.070
the weaponization of it by leaking it—talk
a little bit about the early days and the

01:53:41.070 --> 01:53:45.940
importance of why we misunderstood what was
going on and what Russia was doing.

01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:50.370
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - First of all, let’s talk
about the Podesta emails.

01:53:50.370 --> 01:53:57.090
John Podesta was Hillary Clinton’s campaign
chairman, and his Gmail account was hacked

01:53:57.090 --> 01:54:01.320
in March of 2016 as the campaign was getting
underway.

01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:05.460
A lot of information was downloaded by the
hackers, and they held onto it.

01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:10.430
They didn’t begin to release it until October,
until Oct. 7.

01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:16.060
Then they began to dribble it out on WikiLeaks
almost every day for the rest of the campaign.

01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:22.350
This information in Podesta’s Gmail account
included confidential discussions about the

01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:23.350
campaign.

01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:27.800
It also included a discussion about some of
Hillary Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.210
that had been controversial.

01:54:30.210 --> 01:54:35.050
I think the daily dribble of this was basically
sabotage.

01:54:35.050 --> 01:54:41.120
This was a way to embarrass the campaign and
to keep this idea that something was fishy

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:46.020
about Hillary and emails in the headlines
almost every day.

01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:49.030
This was a real active measure.

01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:55.500
This was an effort not just by a foreign power
to hack and collect information and get some

01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:00.490
espionage, because the United States does
that also, but to weaponize that information,

01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:05.400
to use the information in a political context,
to try and get it resolved.

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:11.320
Just like had been done in Ukraine, this information
was weaponized by leaking it through WikiLeaks,

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:16.520
and I think it had an effect, because it created
doubt; it created suspicion.

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:23.980
In many, many ways, this kind of hybrid warfare
is designed to cast doubt on people, to create

01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:27.610
suspicions about what they might be up to,
not to answer the questions, just to raise

01:55:27.610 --> 01:55:28.880
the questions.

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:36.600
So this was a serious active-measures campaign
that goes beyond just normal espionage and

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:37.790
intelligence collection.

01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:38.790
…

01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:44.620
JIM GILMORE - So the effect of it on Hillary
Clinton’s campaign early on then was what?

01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:47.820
It certainly had an effect at the DNC, at
the convention.

01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.500
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Yeah, it had a big effect
at the convention.

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:53.240
The head of the DNC [Debbie Wasserman Schultz]
was forced to resign.

01:55:53.240 --> 01:56:01.650
This kind of suspicion and doubt that came
out from the emails was exactly what hybrid

01:56:01.650 --> 01:56:02.650
warfare was all about.

01:56:02.650 --> 01:56:05.290
It was really about disruption.

01:56:05.290 --> 01:56:10.420
And the disruption continued because Hillary
Clinton had to fight back against the idea

01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:16.360
that something was amiss in her use of a private
email server when she had been secretary of

01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.360
state.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:21.570
That controversy over email, just the word
“email” and “Hillary Clinton,” you

01:56:21.570 --> 01:56:24.390
know, could hurt her campaign, and this kept
it alive.

01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:30.090
It kept it alive in a way that I think was
again sort of a political sabotage.

01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:34.580
It wasn’t simply a question of somebody
leaking something in the public interest,

01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:37.940
but it was leaked with an intent to disrupt
and destroy.

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:44.720
A great part of this was an effort by Russia
to begin to hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy,

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:49.430
to begin to make it difficult for her to get
elected president, to throw hurdles in her

01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:53.050
way, and this is what classic active measures
are about.

01:56:53.050 --> 01:56:54.050
…

01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:55.050
JIM GILMORE - Sum up the motivations of Putin.

01:56:55.050 --> 01:56:56.330
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Yeah.

01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:58.300
Putin’s motivations work in several levels,
OK.

01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:03.210
In a very deep, visceral level, he believes
that the popular protests that we've seen

01:57:03.210 --> 01:57:09.340
throughout the former Soviet Union in the
last 15 to 16 years were all manipulated,

01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:12.640
that they were cynically manipulated by the
West.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:18.510
He believes that the CIA was behind them,
that the people who were protesting on the

01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:24.120
streets, from the Rose Revolution, the Orange
Revolution, that all of these were just setups

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.960
and that the Americans were behind it.

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:33.720
So he especially is angry about the 2011 protests
in Moscow, which went right to the heart of

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:39.240
his rule, which seemed to him to be very,
very threatening, and he blamed Hillary Clinton

01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.460
for orchestrating that.

01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.390
He was wrong.

01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:44.190
They were genuine protests.

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:50.160
But in his mind, they were manipulated; they
were organized by the West.

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:55.110
I think that Putin’s next motivation is
that he wanted to make sure Hillary Clinton,

01:57:55.110 --> 01:58:00.690
who had organized these protests he thought,
did not get elected president of the United

01:58:00.690 --> 01:58:01.690
States.

01:58:01.690 --> 01:58:07.530
He also wanted to show, I think, in a kind
of bravado way, that democracy wasn’t all

01:58:07.530 --> 01:58:12.710
it was cracked up to be, that democracy could
be messy and chaotic, because Putin had been

01:58:12.710 --> 01:58:18.250
arguing for a long time that he didn’t want
to be lectured anymore by Americans or Westerners

01:58:18.250 --> 01:58:24.510
about democracy and the virtues of the democratic
world.

01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:30.730
He has said that he felt Russia had its own
culture, its own civilization, and he deeply

01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:32.470
resented these lectures.

01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:38.600
He deeply resented even such benign activities
as democracy promotion.

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:44.010
He saw it as part of a conspiracy, a plot
to undermine him and other leaders.

01:58:44.010 --> 01:58:50.900
I think that Putin was also motivated by a
desire to say to many people, “You see,

01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:55.000
democracy ain't so great either,” because
he didn’t believe in democracy, not for

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
a minute.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
...

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.030
So what Putin did is, he grabbed that chaos
button, that chaos button that was part of

01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:06.540
hybrid warfare, and he just cranked it a few
more notches to turn up the chaos in the United

01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:11.810
States, to turn up the level of distrust,
of suspicion and of bewilderment and disorienting

01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:15.680
developments in the United States election.

01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:22.790
It was a classic use of active measures in
a hybrid warfare operation against the United

01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:23.790
States.

01:59:23.790 --> 01:59:29.730
I think Putin was also deeply personally bitter
about the Panama Papers.

01:59:29.730 --> 01:59:36.870
The Panama Papers was the revelation from
the records of a law firm in Panama of a huge

01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:42.630
amount of offshore accounts by powerful people
around the world, not only in Russia, but

01:59:42.630 --> 01:59:50.050
the disclosures included a hefty dose of fresh
information about Putin’s pals, his cronies

01:59:50.050 --> 01:59:52.140
in Russia.

01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:57.540
There was an enormous amount of new information
about the billions and billions of dollars

01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:59.990
they were moving in offshore accounts.

01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:06.430
I think this really, really hurt Putin, because
to him, again, it didn’t seem like a group

02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:11.320
of journalists would published the Panama
Papers, which they did, but instead, he was

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:17.750
deeply paranoid and suspicious that this was
the American CIA, that this was the United

02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:22.360
States and the West manipulating things, just
like those protests.

02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:26.780
This was a strike right at his heart.

02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:36.170
This was a strike right at his circle of cronies.

02:00:36.170 --> 02:00:37.170
…

02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:43.130
Talk a little bit about Trump’s statements,
how he was using the leaks to help his election

02:00:43.130 --> 02:00:44.130
campaign.

02:00:44.130 --> 02:00:54.160
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - On Oct. 7, the Intelligence
Community announced that they saw Russia’s

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:57.850
hand behind this hacking.

02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:00.370
That should have been really big headlines
in the United States.

02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:05.990
It wasn’t, because that’s also the day
that the Access—what was it?

02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.990
JIM GILMORE - Access Hollywood.

02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.990
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Yeah.

02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:11.690
That was also the day that the Access Hollywood
tape came out, and also the day that the Podesta

02:01:11.690 --> 02:01:13.190
emails started to leak.

02:01:13.190 --> 02:01:20.370
But the thing is that the intelligence assessment
should have been huge headlines and should

02:01:20.370 --> 02:01:22.530
have overtaken the news cycle for a long time.

02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:24.040
It was big news.

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:29.440
But it sank in the rest of the shouting of
the campaign.

02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:34.150
And Trump and his campaign seemed unperturbed
by it.

02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:35.500
He didn’t raise it.

02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:44.510
He tried to essentially call upon Russia to
do more, and at one moment he says, “Hey,

02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:48.980
Russia, are you listening, you know, about
Hillary’s emails from when she was secretary

02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:49.980
of state?”

02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:56.900
So for him, I think he felt that the issue
of Hillary’s vulnerability to anything having

02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:01.040
to do with emails was something he could exploit.

02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:07.340
In many ways, Trump’s interest in the campaign
of exploiting this, that damaged Hillary Clinton’s

02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:13.370
campaign, was exactly what Putin was after:
to exploit it, to damage Hillary Clinton’s

02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:17.900
campaign, to raise questions that couldn’t
be answered, to undermine her legitimacy.

02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:18.900
...

02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:24.360
JIM GILMORE - How he reacted toward Putin,
what do we know about that, or what can we

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:26.270
say about that?

02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:34.490
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Putin, for a long time,
has felt that Russia needed to stand up from

02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:39.840
its knees and be heard, even if it was weakened
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:45.850
In fact, Putin has kind of a long-term campaign,
you might say, to make Russia great again.

02:02:45.850 --> 02:02:47.560
He’s a nationalist.

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.699
He’s aggressive.

02:02:48.699 --> 02:02:55.280
He believes in using all kinds of weapons,
oftentimes asymmetrical weapons, to attack

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.480
people that are bigger and stronger than he
is.

02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:06.090
You know, in many ways Trump has a similar
worldview, a view that’s zero-sum—if I

02:03:06.090 --> 02:03:15.720
lose, you win, and if I win, you lose—and
a view that is very, very much centered around

02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:17.690
Trump’s personality.

02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:21.380
Putin also has built a world centered around
his personality.

02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:27.790
He’s built a kind of personal authoritarianism
in Russia.

02:03:27.790 --> 02:03:33.690
Putin has all but mowed down the free press
and civil society in Russia.

02:03:33.690 --> 02:03:36.251
He has really pushed aside democracy.

02:03:36.251 --> 02:03:42.420
And Trump does not have strong feelings about
democratic norms in the United States.

02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:47.750
Of course, he’s bound in a bigger system
that is a vibrant democracy, but Trump’s

02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:51.330
personal feelings about democratic norms are
very, very ambivalent.

02:03:51.330 --> 02:03:57.010
Then, in his inaugural address, Trump said,
“I as president am not going to tell other

02:03:57.010 --> 02:04:01.780
countries how to behave; we’re not going
to impose our values on you.”

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:03.170
And he has said this repeatedly.

02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:06.360
Well, this is music to Putin’s ears.

02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:11.240
The fact that the United States will no longer
lecture him about democracy, that’s exactly

02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.800
what he’s been asking for for many, many
years.

02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:20.050
But for Trump to say this, for Trump not to
talk about democracy and human rights to countries

02:04:20.050 --> 02:04:25.860
that violate it, is breaking with decades
of practice and policy in the United States.

02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:33.280
I think that Putin saw an American president
coming along who would acknowledge him as

02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:41.270
10 feet tall, who wouldn’t lecture him on
democracy and human rights, who would be a

02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:46.940
tough nationalist, and who didn’t care much
about democratic norms.

02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:49.640
In all of these things, they share a common
view.

02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:53.610
JIM GILMORE - You talked a little bit already
about the Oct. 7 release of the DNI [Director

02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:57.480
of National Intelligence] report.

02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:02.030
Let’s finish that up and also combine it
with where we’re going next anyway, which

02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:07.130
is this question is, yes, they released it.

02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:13.420
Yes, they were overtaken by other news stories,
including the Access Hollywood tapes.

02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:19.860
But did there seem to be any grand strategy
to really get this message out?

02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:28.180
How does that define what was being done in
the White House, the reluctance to move forward

02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:29.180
with this?

02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:35.730
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - If you look back, the Oct.
7 statement was very, very clear.

02:05:35.730 --> 02:05:40.190
Intelligence Community said, “We are confident
that Russia has been stealing this information

02:05:40.190 --> 02:05:42.190
and that they’ve been using it against us.”

02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:45.720
There wasn’t any equivocation in this statement.

02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:50.670
But the way it came out, it was then just
put out and dropped, and I think this should

02:05:50.670 --> 02:05:54.090
have been a major news story for quite a while.

02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:59.430
Instead, it was overtaken almost immediately
by other events, and I think part of the reason

02:05:59.430 --> 02:06:02.530
here is the Obama White House didn’t push
it.

02:06:02.530 --> 02:06:09.040
I think in their internal deliberations, they
were thinking, if we make a big issue of this,

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:14.980
will we be accused of trying to put our finger
on the scale of the election?

02:06:14.980 --> 02:06:20.620
Will we be accused of trying to influence
the outcome of the election?

02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:25.690
You have to remember, at the time, Donald
Trump was warning his supporters, “The election

02:06:25.690 --> 02:06:31.570
might be rigged,” and I think people inside
the Obama White House were relatively confident

02:06:31.570 --> 02:06:33.650
that Hillary Clinton was going to win.

02:06:33.650 --> 02:06:38.810
They didn’t want to do anything that would
seem like President Obama was going to interfere

02:06:38.810 --> 02:06:44.100
in the outcome of the election, so when this
information came out, they didn’t publicize

02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:45.100
it widely.

02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:47.739
They did not pursue it like they should have.

02:06:47.739 --> 02:06:48.739
…

02:06:48.739 --> 02:06:54.070
JIM GILMORE - ... Talk a little bit more about
the tools that he [Putin] was using, and specifically

02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:58.870
the use of venues like RT.

02:06:58.870 --> 02:07:05.600
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - This is a multipronged
attack.

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:13.630
And one of those avenues, of course, is the
use of classic broadcast, television broadcast—RT,

02:07:13.630 --> 02:07:20.750
a Russian state-owned broadcaster; Sputnik,
a Russian state-owned news service broadcast—and

02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:26.090
[they] pushed out fake news, things that were
made up or partially made up.

02:07:26.090 --> 02:07:31.820
A lot of times these kinds of efforts involved
things that are only half true, but create

02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:33.270
doubt and suspicion.

02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:34.780
That’s part of the goal.

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:39.470
Also, the digital revolution opened up a whole
’nother avenue.

02:07:39.470 --> 02:07:47.540
This way, in social media and the use of bots
and trolls, enormous amounts of small pings

02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:53.340
could be created to people, and the recipients
of these wouldn’t often know that they were

02:07:53.340 --> 02:08:00.210
generated by Russia or that some kind of conspiracy
or suspicion or doubt that had surfaced in

02:08:00.210 --> 02:08:03.800
their newsfeed that day was created by Russia.

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:09.690
It allowed a lot of this kind of hybrid warfare
to be carried out without fingerprints.

02:08:09.690 --> 02:08:14.300
And of course, a third way was clandestine
cyber conflict.

02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:18.980
Cyber conflict could be used, was used in
Ukraine to close down an electricity grid.

02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:24.930
It could be used also to get into computers,
to download information like John Podesta’s

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:32.990
emails, to then release them and again create
suspicion and to undermine the legitimacy.

02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:35.710
All these different channels were working
simultaneously.

02:08:35.710 --> 02:08:45.620
JIM GILMORE - Just to clarify, the use of,
for instance, RT and Sputnik, what are the

02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:52.180
fingerprints that one can derive about the
government’s control over these avenues?

02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:56.580
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I don’t know what you
mean.

02:08:56.580 --> 02:09:01.010
JIM GILMORE - When RT or Sputnik is putting
out this word, how do we know that the government

02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:03.330
is supportive of it, behind it?

02:09:03.330 --> 02:09:07.410
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Well, we know that the
Russian government owns the RT and Sputnik.

02:09:07.410 --> 02:09:11.280
They are state-run and state-owned, and they
reflect the views of Russia.

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:13.510
They're actually not seen by that many people.

02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:19.440
But in the world of hybrid warfare and disinformation,
all you need to do is float something that’s

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:24.180
incorrect or wrong, and then other people
will seize on it, and dissemination happens

02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:30.270
at light speed, and oftentimes, without any
fingerprints.

02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:35.130
JIM GILMORE - Election Day.

02:09:35.130 --> 02:09:41.340
What is the reaction in Moscow to the election
of Donald Trump?

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:48.380
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I think the reaction in
Moscow of Putin and his elites was elation,

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:52.530
because first of all, they had a real dislike
of Hillary Clinton, and they were worried

02:09:52.530 --> 02:09:56.590
that Hillary Clinton was going to be elected
and would be very, very difficult.

02:09:56.590 --> 02:10:00.970
So by Hillary’s defeat, they first of all
felt euphoric.

02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:06.910
I think that the fact that Donald Trump was
elected was kind of a consolation prize.

02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:13.110
He seemed to have parallel views with Putin,
and I think they hoped that the first fruits

02:10:13.110 --> 02:10:18.780
of that might be relaxing the sanctions that
had been put on, the economic sanctions, for

02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:24.860
the insurrection in Ukraine and for the activities
in Ukraine and Crimea.

02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:32.590
I'm sure that the very first reaction that
Putin had was, his operation had succeeded.

02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:43.090
It’s not really known to us whether he intended
to defeat Hillary or to elect Trump.

02:10:43.090 --> 02:10:48.410
But on the night that he learned that he had
done both, he was probably very, very happy

02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:49.410
with the outcome.

02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:50.410
…

02:10:50.410 --> 02:10:59.230
JIM GILMORE - ... So from day one, this Russian
story has been dogging Trump’s heels.

02:10:59.230 --> 02:11:04.860
Talk a little bit about the frustrations that
he’s shown with it and the effect on his

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:05.860
agenda.

02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:10.540
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Let me try it this way.

02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:17.520
From the beginning, I think that Putin hoped
that Trump would be able to deliver a different

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:23.350
kind of reaction to Russia: that Trump would
be able to deliver a lifting of sanctions

02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:30.730
over Ukraine; that Trump wouldn’t lecture
Russia about democracy and human rights; that

02:11:30.730 --> 02:11:34.640
Trump would make a place for Putin at the
big boys’ table.

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.630
That’s what Putin wanted, a place at the
table.

02:11:37.630 --> 02:11:43.530
He wanted, even though Russia has an economy
about the size of Italy, Putin wanted that

02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:47.310
chair that had been held by the Soviet Union,
a great superpower.

02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:49.780
And he wanted Trump to treat him that way.

02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:55.630
I think Trump was inclined to do those things,
but what happened was a terrible backlash.

02:11:55.630 --> 02:12:01.820
What happened is, then, information about
what Russia had done continued to accumulate,

02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:06.160
as it continued to be evident that Russia
had carried out these active measures against

02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.050
American democracy.

02:12:08.050 --> 02:12:13.710
The American body politic, American voters,
people began to get very, very unhappy with

02:12:13.710 --> 02:12:14.710
it.

02:12:14.710 --> 02:12:20.820
They certainly saw these headlines day after
day about what Russia tried to do.

02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:22.450
I think Congress saw them also.

02:12:22.450 --> 02:12:28.140
And people grew really, really pissed off
about what Putin had done in America.

02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:32.980
Even though Putin may have felt, right after
the election, that he accomplished his goals

02:12:32.980 --> 02:12:39.600
of damaging Hillary’s campaign, what he
generated was a really tough backlash.

02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:45.200
The whole operation, in some ways, backfired,
because soon, the political mood in the United

02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:49.070
States shifted against Russia.

02:12:49.070 --> 02:12:55.600
It started to do that, especially in the spring,
as more and more information came out about

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.980
these active measures that Russia had taken,
the American people did not react very kindly

02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:03.280
to it; Congress didn’t react very kindly
to it.

02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:07.950
This left Trump in a tough spot, because if
he wanted to have a better relationship with

02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:13.200
Russia, it was going to be a lot harder now
that the whole operation had backfired.

02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.700
The American people were unhappy about their
election being meddled with and interfered

02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:19.240
with by Russia.

02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:25.540
I think that for Putin, this is part of the
accounting of this whole episode that is still

02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:29.140
unfolding, which is, was it really a success?

02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:34.490
In some ways, he could maybe say he contributed
to Hillary Clinton’s defeat, maybe.

02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:36.160
There were other factors.

02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:43.810
But he now has on his hands a really angry
backlash in the United States.

02:13:43.810 --> 02:13:50.670
Congress has just voted again to lock down
the sanctions by overwhelming majorities,

02:13:50.670 --> 02:13:56.180
so Putin has got a situation that seems to
be much worse for him than when he started

02:13:56.180 --> 02:14:03.820
out using his clever hybrid warfare techniques,
his active measures, meddling in the American

02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:04.820
election.

02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:07.440
It all seems to have actually backfired against
him.

02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:08.440
…

02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:14.690
JIM GILMORE - The whole question of collusion,
just from 20,000 feet, the many issues of

02:14:14.690 --> 02:14:20.210
the cases that have been ID’d so far about
potential collusion, from [then-National Security

02:14:20.210 --> 02:14:25.680
Adviser Michael] Flynn to the June meeting,
whatever, what's your take on it?

02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:33.540
Is this a situation of the Trump administration
being willing or unwilling dupes?

02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:41.290
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - I don’t think we know
whether the active measures that Putin sent

02:14:41.290 --> 02:14:48.100
toward our election to try and influence it
were guided with help from inside the Trump

02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:53.980
campaign or if they were simply unwitting
receivers of help.

02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:58.840
I think that, in the middle of a presidential
campaign, where everything is very tense and

02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:03.360
tight, it’s possible that the Trump people
just felt the wind at their back and didn’t

02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:04.460
really know.

02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:07.820
It’s also possible that they were in close
coordination.

02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:11.560
We don’t know really the truth of this.

02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:17.100
I think the focus on the word “collusion”
is unfortunate, because what really happened

02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:24.790
here, we know, is that Russia undertook, through
multiple channels, active measures to try

02:15:24.790 --> 02:15:32.650
and influence American political campaign
and election to change the course of our history.

02:15:32.650 --> 02:15:37.590
The important thing is the offense, the attack
against the United States.

02:15:37.590 --> 02:15:42.240
The question about how it was received and
by whom, we don’t have enough facts yet

02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:43.670
to answer that question.

02:15:43.670 --> 02:15:44.670
…

02:15:44.670 --> 02:15:50.220
JIM GILMORE - … How do you see, in the end,
what this was all about for Putin?

02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:57.800
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - If you look back at the
whole of Putin’s career, and all those years

02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:04.800
spent in the KGB and now as president, you
see a common thread, which is his deep suspicion

02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:10.940
that events are orchestrated and manipulated
by dark forces.

02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:15.850
He certainly has believed, for many, many
years, as the KGB did through its history,

02:16:15.850 --> 02:16:23.280
that the United States was secretly trying
to undermine, orchestrate, manipulate and

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:24.780
subvert events.

02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:30.360
I think that carrying that into the presidency,
Putin saw all the color revolutions, the Rose

02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:35.800
Revolution and the Orange Revolution, as another
example of the United States trying to steer

02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:40.179
things its way, and he was deeply suspicious
of that.

02:16:40.179 --> 02:16:47.250
Also, he resented deeply the idea that there
was one system and one set of values, democracy

02:16:47.250 --> 02:16:50.830
and rule of law, that should dominate the
world.

02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:58.469
He felt that his system and his ideas of a
personalized authoritarianism could also be

02:16:58.469 --> 02:17:04.971
a major power and that he could build Russia
into a world power on that basis, and he could

02:17:04.971 --> 02:17:10.769
push back against democracy and all the lectures
that he so much disliked.

02:17:10.769 --> 02:17:18.770
I think what we saw all the way through, certainly
in the Munich speech in 2007 through the Crimea

02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:26.019
speech in 2014, in his reaction to all the
color revolutions, right up through the MH-17

02:17:26.019 --> 02:17:31.420
[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17] disinformation
campaign, and then the reaction to the Panama

02:17:31.420 --> 02:17:37.080
Papers, and the reaction to the protests in
Moscow—remember, in those protests, right

02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.559
outside the Kremlin walls, people are holding
up placards and chanting, “Russia without

02:17:42.559 --> 02:17:43.559
Putin.”

02:17:43.559 --> 02:17:49.780
I think Putin felt like he had to strike back
at whoever was behind that, and he didn’t

02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:53.099
believe the Russians on the street were genuinely
in protest.

02:17:53.099 --> 02:17:56.090
He believed that Hillary Clinton was.

02:17:56.090 --> 02:18:03.670
This entire active-measures campaign was revenge
for what he thought and what he suspected

02:18:03.670 --> 02:18:10.290
was the orchestration by the United States
of some kind of deep, behind-the-scenes movement

02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:17.220
to change the nature of democracy, to support
democracy when he was against it.

02:18:17.220 --> 02:18:23.630
I think Putin feared deep down that somehow
if the United States could promote regime

02:18:23.630 --> 02:18:31.510
change in Iraq, if the United States could
intervene in Kosovo in 1999, if the United

02:18:31.510 --> 02:18:37.901
States was teaching democracy promotion through
all these former Soviet republics, that some

02:18:37.901 --> 02:18:41.000
day the United States would come for him.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:46.389
He was deeply afraid of the idea of regime
change and believed that the United States

02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:52.550
was cynically using it in the—and it was
dressing up its ideals as democratic and rule

02:18:52.550 --> 02:18:57.970
of law, but was just every bit as cynical
and vicious as he was.

02:18:57.970 --> 02:19:02.580
I think Putin undertook the active measures
against the United States, partially because

02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:07.219
Hillary Clinton represented such a threat,
but also, the American system represented

02:19:07.219 --> 02:19:08.350
such a threat.

02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:15.530
The American system and its promotion all
over the world of rule of law and democracy

02:19:15.530 --> 02:19:18.619
threatened him because he didn’t have those
things, and he didn’t want them.

02:19:18.619 --> 02:19:19.619
…

02:19:19.619 --> 02:19:25.690
JIM GILMORE - And long term, what do you think
the long-term effects of these actions that

02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:28.710
Putin took in America was going to be?

02:19:28.710 --> 02:19:36.019
DAVID E. HOFFMAN - Putin has managed a country
that’s got an economy the size of Italy

02:19:36.019 --> 02:19:39.559
and has a lot of problems of its own.

02:19:39.559 --> 02:19:44.060
But he’s managed to insert himself into
the United States’ political discussion

02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:49.330
in a big, big way, in a way, actually, that
it hadn’t been for many, many years.

02:19:49.330 --> 02:19:54.490
The active measures he took against the United
States are now part of a huge river of anger

02:19:54.490 --> 02:19:57.311
running through American politics.

02:19:57.311 --> 02:20:04.950
And you know, in a certain way, Putin has
strutted back onto the stage, shoulders back,

02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:06.820
saying, “Russia is here.”

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:11.900
But he’s also created a terrible backlash,
and I don’t think we know yet where that’s

02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:15.860
going to lead and whether or not, in the end,
he’s going to look at this as a success

02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:16.220
or a failure.
