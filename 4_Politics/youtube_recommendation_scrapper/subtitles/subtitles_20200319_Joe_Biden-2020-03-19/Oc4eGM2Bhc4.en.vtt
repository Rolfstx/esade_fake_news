00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:24.710 align:start position:0%
region doing what's the status limiter
 

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.049 align:start position:0%
region doing what's the status limiter
because<00:22:24.890><c> each</c><00:22:25.040><c> one</c><00:22:25.250><c> is</c><00:22:25.340><c> equipped</c><00:22:25.429><c> differently</c>

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:26.059 align:start position:0%
because each one is equipped differently
 

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:28.390 align:start position:0%
because each one is equipped differently
and<00:22:26.210><c> so</c><00:22:26.750><c> you're</c><00:22:26.900><c> asking</c><00:22:27.049><c> a</c><00:22:27.470><c> variety</c><00:22:28.370><c> of</c>

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
and so you're asking a variety of
 

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.799 align:start position:0%
and so you're asking a variety of
