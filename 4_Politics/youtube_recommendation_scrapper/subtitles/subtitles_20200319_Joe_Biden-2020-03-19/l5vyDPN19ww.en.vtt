&gt;&gt; This country goes into 2020
as divided as it's ever been.

you speak your mind.

However, that is not without its
downsides,

not be based

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.970
on the way you have treated me,
but I wouldn't do that.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.830
&gt;&gt; The way Trump sees media,
the way he sees life, is all,

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.330
"They like me
or they don't like me."

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.130
&gt;&gt; We need strength.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.730
&gt;&gt; And in that moment,
I got moved from

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.130
the "she likes me" category
into the "she doesn't like me."

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.100
And I do believe, I believe
that night, the anger was real--

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.700
his anger at me
was real that night.

Thank you all very much.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.430

just as he'd done as a reality
TV star.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.070
And afterwards, in Spin Alley,
he would use the press

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.700
to keep it going.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.000

&gt;&gt; It was like mosquitos to,
to a lantern on a summer night.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.570
I mean, the entire national
press corps descended.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.870
&gt;&gt; People were being trampled,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.400

all over the place,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.770
and I'd never seen a scene
like this.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.000
I mean, I've seen many media
stampedes,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.370
but nothing like that.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.970
&gt;&gt; What's your history
with Megyn?

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.800
&gt;&gt; I think Megyn, I think Megyn
behaved very badly, personally.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.170
You didn't like that?

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.730
&gt;&gt; No, I thought it was
an unfair question.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.430
They didn't ask those questions
of anybody else.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.170

was an unfair question.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.230
&gt;&gt; She starts asking me all
sorts of ridiculous questions.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.370
And, you know, you could see
there was blood

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.730
coming out of her eyes.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.200
Uh, blood coming out of her
wherever, but...

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.230
&gt;&gt; Trump recognized that it was
a good storyline.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.100
And he kept fuel going under
that fire,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.930
because he knew some portion of
his audience

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.700
loved to see him challenging,
you know, a powerful woman,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.270
never mind a woman at Fox.

were escalating.

our power

"You've got to knock off these
stories.

up tomorrow."

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.030
&gt;&gt; "If Kelly can't take the
heat, go back to the kitchen."

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.570
&gt;&gt; "Trump should commission a
statue of Ms. Kelly on her knees

and place it in front
of Trump Tower."

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Under the onslaught,

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.300
Ailes eventually backed down--
he needed Breitbart, Bannon,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.030
and Trump more than
he needed Kelly.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.500
&gt;&gt; Roger definitely felt
that he had to keep

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.530
that sort of Breitbart wing
of the viewership onboard.

to Trump's attacks on me and Fox

in the wake of that debate.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.570
And he definitely wasn't going
to lose 30% of the viewers,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.070
uh, as this man,
who by August of 2015,

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.500
we knew was the likely
Republican nominee.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.570
He didn't want that guy to be
driving a division

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.400

to come--

looking for was strength.

And in that moment,
here's what voters saw.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:43.130
They saw a generation
of Republican politicians

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.570
who kowtowed to Fox News,
who genuflected.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:54.000
Then they saw somebody take on
Fox News, and Trump won.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.270
He broke Fox News.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.770

Republican politics

I was not referring to hormones

to say something offensive,

to fuel his political rise.

hey, you in the center,

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.530
why don't you turn your camera?

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.670
Show them how many people come
to these rallies.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.730
Turn 'em.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:55.770
Go ahead, turn 'em.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.430
Go ahead.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:03.630
(cheers and applause)

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.170
&gt;&gt; Cable news was so fascinated
with Donald Trump

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.130
that they were putting him on
the air almost every day.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.930
Every one of his rallies made
great television.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.670
And the news media
jumped on that

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.230
and gave him a lot of airtime.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.700
&gt;&gt; And you know we're in, look
at all those

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.230
live television feeds--
it's always tough,

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.700
every time I speak,
they put me on live television,

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.330
so I have to make
different speeches.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.530
These guys go around, they make
the same speech

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.830
hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of times,

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.370
nobody cares-- it's true.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.400
&gt;&gt; He was looking out
at the camera bank.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.670
And he could see the red light
on the camera.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.500
And that meant
that he was live on CNN.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.170
&gt;&gt; You got CNN live,
you got them all, and...

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.200
&gt;&gt; Or Fox or one of the other
networks.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.200
And he said that what he tried
to do in those rallies was say

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.370
whatever it took
to keep the red light on.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.430
&gt;&gt; Now, if you like the media,
give them a big hand,

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.970
and if you don't,
give them a big boo.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:00.070
(crowd booing)

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.670
I had a feeling.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.970
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump running
for president

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.830
is a plane that
crashes every day.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.070
There is news as long
as he's talking.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.200
Uh, there's news even if he
isn't talking,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.470
because who knows
what he might say?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.930
&gt;&gt; Once again, we're still
awaiting Donald Trump's arrival

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.500
at his South Carolina rally.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.070
&gt;&gt; And so you have things like
CNN just showing

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.530
the empty podium where he's
ready to get on stage.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.800
&gt;&gt; The breaking news, we are
awaiting Donald Trump--

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.870
he will speak live any moment.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.200
&gt;&gt; That empty podium
is now news.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.370
&gt;&gt; Stand by, you're going
to hear Donald Trump live.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:38.030
&gt;&gt; Because it tells you,
if you wait long enough,

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.030
something crazy might happen
again.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.900
&gt;&gt; We are awaiting Donald Trump
to take the stage.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.170
This is out of Tampa, Florida...

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.770
&gt;&gt; Breaking news, Donald Trump
about to rally

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.030
thousands of supporters.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.830
&gt;&gt; Live pictures that we're
bringing to you.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.700
This is of a Donald Trump rally
about to get underway in Tampa.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.970
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.670
We're awaiting the arrival of
Donald Trump

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.530
at a rally in Virginia Beach.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.930
These are live pictures right
now as the crowd...

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And as the months
wore on,

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.470
Trump's message caught fire
with a more sinister crowd.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.070
&gt;&gt; The anger only increased as
it got farther along.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.870
&gt;&gt; It became completely
acceptable.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.830
It became okay to come
to a Trump rally

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.570
and wear a shirt that says

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.870
Hillary Clinton is a
C-(bleep)-(bleep)-T.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.730
&gt;&gt; The campaign is
continually dogged

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:37.530
by a small and vocal number of
white supremacists,

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.170
Klansmen, neo-Nazis.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.430
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Roger Stone was
a longtime political adviser

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.800
to Donald Trump.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.370
He has since been convicted
of lying to Congress.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.330
&gt;&gt; This isn't a very large group
of people,

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.130
but they're very vocal.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.930
And they attach themselves
to Trump.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.730
&gt;&gt; Trump, whenever there was a
moment to draw a line

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.030
between himself and these
extreme parts

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.900
of the voting bloc, he refused.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.330
I think without question, the
only way you can interpret that

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.400
is that he was going to use
these groups

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.200
to try to build this coalition.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.800
(crowd shouting)

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As anti-Trump
protesters showed up

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.170
at his rallies...
&gt;&gt; There's the guy.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.730
Totally disruptive,
throwing punches.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:21.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Trump had no boundaries.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.270
&gt;&gt; I loved the old days.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.430
Do you know what they used to do
to guys like that

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.100
when they were in a place
like this?

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.930
They'd be carried out
on a stretcher, folks.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.170
I'd like to punch him
in the face, I'll tell ya.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.700
Ah, it's true.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.500
&gt;&gt; And you start seeing these
really ugly moments

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.470
at the rallies, um, with...
protesters,

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.800
some of whom are non-white
protesters,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.030
getting treated very violently
by, by his supporters.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.200
&gt;&gt; (shouting)

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.430
&gt;&gt; Trump himself seeming to
incite his supporters

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.970
to go after protesters.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.330
&gt;&gt; Knock the crap out of him,
would you?

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.730
Just knock the hell out of him.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.870
I promise you I will pay for the
legal fees, I promise.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.400
I promise.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump was pouring
fuel on the flames of division.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:06.830
His brand of politics
and American anger

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:11.100
were becoming one and the same.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.030
&gt;&gt; He did not create
this moment.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.230
He did not create the ugliness.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.200
He did not create the Twitter,
social media universe.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.270
He did not create the
xenophobia, the nationalism,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.970
the backlash against globalism
and global crusades.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.270
He did not create
entertainment politics,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.470
politics as a form
of realty show television.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.100
He created none of this.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.100
He is its pure manifestation.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.770
The absolute logical endpoint
of a bunch of trends

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.200
in American life.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.070
He is its beneficiary.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.700
100%.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.470
(laughter)

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:56.730
&gt;&gt; A new poll has 87% of
Republicans supporting Trump.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.270
The other 13% are currently
standing on bridges

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.000
looking vacantly
into the distance.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.530
(laughter)

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.370
&gt;&gt; Critics say the poll was
unscientific,

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.300
because even science can't
explain how Donald Trump

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.800
is still in the lead.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.830
&gt;&gt; And six flags on stage--

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.530
he's like a president and an
amusement park

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.030
all rolled up into one.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:20.500
(laughter)

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.100
♪ ♪

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Donald Trump wasn't
the only one

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.570
who seized the opportunity to
exploit the nation's division.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.000
Vladimir Putin did it, too,
using a cyber-attack to strike

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.370
at the fault lines
of American democracy.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.630
&gt;&gt; The effectiveness of this
interference from Russia

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.200
depends on a couple of things.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.130
(people speaking Russian)

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.730
&gt;&gt; It depends on the
polarization

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.570
of politics in America.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.730
There were divides, and Russia
was pushing out material

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.100
that exploited those divides,
that broadened them,

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.970
that called attention
to those divides.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.870
(phone chimes)

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Posts on black power...

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.500
&gt;&gt; "Staying woke,
uplifting our people."

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.170
&gt;&gt; "We are proud to be black
and stand..."

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: On Southern
pride...

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.570
&gt;&gt; "The Confederate flag
represents heritage..."

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.370
&gt;&gt; "Join our fight to save
Southern heritage!"

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Russian attacks
played into deep-seated fears.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.030
&gt;&gt; "If I win, Clinton wins!"

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Exploiting both
sides

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.870
on the most divisive issues.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.830
&gt;&gt; "Stop police brutality!"

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.930
&gt;&gt; "Blue lives matter!"

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Immigration.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.630
&gt;&gt; "It's time to get rid of
parasites!"

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Guns.
&gt;&gt; "I'll keep my guns ..."

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.130
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Race.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.930
&gt;&gt; "White kids chant N-word in
school bus."

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.370
&gt;&gt; And that's when I realized,

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.730
"Uh-oh, things
have gone too far."

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.570
There was a tipping point
that took place.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.300
And I think the Russians didn't
create that tipping point,

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.930
but they exploited it.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.070
They saw the fissures of...
of division.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.670
They saw these, these...
these pivot points

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.470
and they went right for them.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump, himself
sowing discord and chaos,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.170
encouraged the Russians to
continue their attack

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.370
and target Hillary Clinton
and the Democrats.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.530
&gt;&gt; I will tell you this:
Russia, if you're listening,

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:04.100
I hope you're able to find
the 30,000 emails

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.100
that are missing.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.600
&gt;&gt; I think they started their
operation to intervene

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.030
in the election with the idea of
simply sowing discord,

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:17.830
and, uh, weakening the United
States as a country by doing so.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.400
It only later became,
uh, a mission

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.870
to actually specifically elect
Donald Trump.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.430
(man speaking Russian)

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To help Trump,
the Russians spread fake news

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.670
about Hillary Clinton.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.670
(reporters speaking Russian)

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.070
&gt;&gt; Vladimir Putin certainly has
our number as a country.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.830
He understood how easily
Americans could be turned

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.800
against each other with
Facebook.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:50.200
What Facebook does is obliterate
the ability to tell the lie

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.600
from truth.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.930
Where what is real,
what is fake,

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.600
is not discernible
and not knowable.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.130
And the consequences of that,
for a democratic republic,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:09.870
are frightening, at best,
to think about.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.400
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One particular
conspiracy theory

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.330
was aired in America by a
Russian propaganda network, RT.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.730
&gt;&gt; ...theories about her health
caught on...

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Exaggerated and
questionable stories

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.770
about Clinton's health...

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.600
&gt;&gt; Under a microscope
are Clinton's falls,

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.870
coughs, and head motions.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.730
(reporters talking)

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.330
(laughing)

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.570
&gt;&gt; Have you talked about vice
presidential possibilities

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.870
with Senator Warren?

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.800
&gt;&gt; You guys have got to try
the cold chai.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.970
&gt;&gt; This video filmed
in June went viral

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.400
and started a slew of rumors
that Clinton

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.830
may have had a seizure.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.100
&gt;&gt; We were watching stories
about Hillary Clinton appearing

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:55.270
on Russian propaganda websites
like Russia Today and Sputnik.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.570
&gt;&gt; A Democratic frontrunner has
been forced to refute rumors

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.330
of her deteriorating health,
maybe.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.100
&gt;&gt; And then somehow ending up in
very similar form

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.900
in the right-wing media
ecosystem of the United States--

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.200
Breitbart, InfoWars,
even Fox News.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.730
&gt;&gt; What was once a concern
voiced in whispers

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.530
is now getting mainstream
attention.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.230
We're talking about Hillary
Clinton's health.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.370
&gt;&gt; Some have said it's like
a mini-seizure.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.500
What does it look like to you?

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.100
&gt;&gt; It could be a post-concussion
syndrome.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.730
You know, your balance is off,

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.970
you're-you're dizzy all the
time, your memory is off...

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was invented,
overblown, but it didn't matter.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.100
&gt;&gt; The fact is, she's out there
giving speeches every day

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.800
and has to cancel them having
these coughing fits.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.400
&gt;&gt; New questions tonight about
Hillary Clinton's health.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.430
&gt;&gt; Good evening, it was a
dramatic moment

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.870
that's already being watch
and re-watched.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.230
&gt;&gt; The episode this morning is
raising more questions

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.530
about her health...

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:51.400
(reporters speaking Russian)

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And the candidate
made the most of it.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.870
&gt;&gt; And she can't make it 15 feet
to her car, give me a break.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.130
Give me a break.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:04.100
(cheers and applause)

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.930
Give me a break!

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As the fake news
spread,

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.900
conservative talk radio host
Charlie Sykes

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.600
saw how it hardened the divide.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.870
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what my
experience was in 2016.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.300
That the flood of these
misleading

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.800
or outright false stories
was increasing.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.570
In the past, I'd always been
able to push back on my audience

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.270
and say, "Okay, you understand
this is not true.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.530
This is not the case."

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.470
You know, "There are not bodies
stacked up

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.170
in the Clinton Library,

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.230
and here's the source
of all of that."

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.270
By late 2016, though,
I was no longer able to do that.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:47.870
People were not willing
to accept the corrections.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.200
And Donald Trump is counting
on this,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.430
and this does fundamentally
change our politics.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:59.230
(laughter)

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.870
&gt;&gt; Not sure why Trump would
openly ask Russia

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.900
to spy on Americans, but I'm
sure he has his treasons...

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.600
(laughter)

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.130
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump is asking Russia
to hack

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.300
our former secretary of state.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.470
&gt;&gt; A man running for president

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.600
just asked Russia
to hack America.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.400
&gt;&gt; Donald, your party wants you
to appeal to the red states,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.070
not the Red State.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.370
(laughter and applause)

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Using conflict and outrage,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.570
Donald Trump had galvanized an
angry base and won over

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.870
the reluctant Republican
establishment.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:41.100
But a tabloid crisis would test
how much they would take

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.070
and how far he could go.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.230
&gt;&gt; That day, we're up in the
25th floor conference room,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.700
and it's Friday afternoon,
about 2:00.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.670
And all of a sudden, Hope Hicks
shows up outside the glass thing

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.270
and she's giving me the signal.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.300
And so I step out.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.830
I go out and I read this thing.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.070
She's got this transcript.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.170
And she's, like, about to cry,
she goes,

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.700
"Oh, this is terrible."

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Breitbart's Steve
Bannon had signed on

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.630
as the C.E.O. of Trump's
campaign.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.730
&gt;&gt; I said, "What are you so
upset about? What is this?"

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.300
"'The Washington Post' is going
to publish a story in an hour."

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.930
And I go,
"What's so bad about it?"

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.330
And she goes,
"Well, look it, he says,

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.870
'I'm going to grab them
by the (bleep).'"

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.870
And I go, "Oh, maybe I haven't
focused on it."

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.630
So I look down, I go,
"Oh, okay, okay."

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.230
&gt;&gt; I gotta use some Tic Tacs
just in case we start kissing.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bannon, Hicks,
a top aide,

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.870
and other members of the Trump
team watched it online.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.100
&gt;&gt; Whatever you want.

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.530
&gt;&gt; (laughing): I'm, like, whoa!

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.200
Boom, that thing hits.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.070
And we're sitting in the
conference room.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.670
And on video-- I didn't quite
realize it was audio and video--

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.570
in video, it's pretty powerful.

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:54.200
So everything shuts down.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.100
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump caught on tape,
in his own words, vulgar words,

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.970
boasting about being able to
grab women by their genitals

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.770
and get away with it because
he's a star.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.300
&gt;&gt; So after the "Access
Hollywood" tape,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.770
our poll numbers took a hit,

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.200
and some national polls had us
down to 35% and her at 48%.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.470
That's with one month
to go exactly.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.700
&gt;&gt; In the audio, you can hear
Trump talk about a married woman

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.930
he tried to have sex with and
how he behaves with women

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:20.930
that he's attracted to.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.630
&gt;&gt; The Trump campaign is in full
damage control mode

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.070
following a troubling story.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.430
I thought that was probably it
for Trump.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.900
It was stunning.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.530
I mean, it was stunning just
to hear, you know,

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:36.800
a major party nominee talk
that way about any group,

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.930
never mind my own, right?

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.330
Women.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:44.370
Um... it was jarring.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.870
It was very jarring.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.100
&gt;&gt; The Trump camp has swiftly
launched into disaster mode.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.200
&gt;&gt; A big, big development in
this campaign as it comes to...

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.970
&gt;&gt; This was the October
surprise.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.630
Had the ability to take down
a campaign.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.900
And the internal discussion
amongst the campaign...

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.570
Some were, "You need to
apologize immediately,"

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:06.700
and some were, "You need to,
uh... double down."

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A damage control
team gathered-- Rudy Giuliani,

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:15.300
Chris Christie,
Kellyanne Conway, Bannon.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.600
&gt;&gt; You know,
it's Rudy and Christie

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.200
and all the traditional
politicians are saying,

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.600
"It's over and you gotta..."

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.930
You know, Trump's going around
and saying,

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.500
"Give me your percentage
and what do I do."

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.900
And they're all, like, you know,
"Zero percent, 20%."

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.770
I go, "It's 100%."

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.900
And he goes... I said,
"Listen, they don't care.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.330
This is locker room talk.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.900
They don't care about vulgarity
or anything like that.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.030
They care about, they're losing
their jobs,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.630
they're losing their country,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.200
they see their country going
away from them."

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Republican
establishment began to defect.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.900
&gt;&gt; (laughing):
He's in a bad mood, okay?

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.800
Now we've got a full revolt.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.470
Pence is nowhere to be found;
he's not out there saying--

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.900
he gives, we get a letter
from him.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.530
Paul Ryan's out of the campaign.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.800
McConnell's out.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.800
Because they thought they were
going to lose

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.330
the Republican Party.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.730
They thought every woman in
America will never vote

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.900
for a Republican again, right?

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.600
Because this guy's a barbarian.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.800
&gt;&gt; This is a political disaster,
no doubt...

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.770
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump's campaign--
its worst crisis ever...

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.430
&gt;&gt; You see so many Republicans
denounce Trump,

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.870
even though he
is the Republican nominee

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.170
and there's not going to be
someone else to emerge.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.470
The Republicans are basically
saying,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.230
"'Whatever, give it
to the Democrats."

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The traditional
rules of politics

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.830
called for an abject apology.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.500
&gt;&gt; I've never said I'm a perfect
person,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500
nor pretended to be someone
that I'm not.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.700
I've said and done things
I regret,

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.070
and the words released today

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:40.770
on this more-than-a-decade-old
video are one of them.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But then he would
reframe the crisis

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.630
on his own terms:
"us versus them."

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.430
&gt;&gt; Bill Clinton has actually
abused women,

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.030
and Hillary has bullied,
attacked, shamed,

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.700
and intimidated his victims.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.830
&gt;&gt; (chanting "Trump")

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And soon, the base
let him know

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.130
they had gotten the message.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.000
&gt;&gt; (chanting): We want Trump!

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.430
&gt;&gt; There's literally this mob
down there.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.370
And he goes,
"Look, there's my people."

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.230
Trump just walks out there.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.030
&gt;&gt; Here he is! Donald!

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.630
Donald! Whoo!

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
They were on his side.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.670
They liked the conflict.
The fight.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.670
&gt;&gt; He will never apologize.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.200
He punches and then he punches
harder and then he doubles down

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.530
and he refigures
and then he punches again.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.200
He is never someone that's going
to say, "I made a mistake,"

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.570
or, "I apologize."

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.400
He will never back down.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
And the very next day--

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.470
just before
the presidential debate...

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.200
Bannon had a plan to keep
the conflict going.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.400
&gt;&gt; We didn't tell anybody.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.700
Trump didn't know about it.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.130
We're in the presidential suite
at the hotel.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.230
Walk up and Trump,
as often he would do,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.630
would kind of lean back and
almost close his eyes,

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.630
and I said,
"Okay, here's what we got.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.400
We got Paula Jones
and all the women that...

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.500
that Clinton assaulted,

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.130
then you're going to sit
in the middle.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.800
We're going to open the door
and they're going to come

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.470
in and we're going to (bleep)
hit them, okay?"

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.230
And he... And I'm sitting there,
I'm making my pitch, right?

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.300
He goes-- I go,
"What do you think?"

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.800
He goes, "I love it."

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.000
(laughs)

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They spirited him
down the freight elevator,

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.830
put him in a conference room,
and opened the doors

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.230
to an unsuspecting press corps.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.530
&gt;&gt; Next thing, I know-- and no
one in the press

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.970
knew this was happening-- there
was a press conference

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.230
with all of Bill Clinton's
accusers

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.900
right before the debate.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.500
&gt;&gt; These four very courageous
women have asked to be here

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.270
and it was our honor
to help them.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:42.170
&gt;&gt; There was widespread shock--
nobody had it beforehand.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.170
&gt;&gt; Mr. Trump may have said some
bad words,

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:52.330
but Bill Clinton raped me and
Hillary Clinton threatened me.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.570
I don't think
there's any comparison.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
They were allegations

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.300
the Clintons had long denied.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.830
But it didn't matter to Bannon
and Trump.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.070
They were sowing more chaos.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:06.030
&gt;&gt; What's the point to all of
this?

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:09.130
It doesn't make Donald Trump or
what he was caught on tape

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.770
saying any better.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:16.330
But it just creates a lot
of confusion and chaos.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.500
&gt;&gt; Even though it felt dirty,
and you felt kind of gross

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.630
when you watched the whole thing
unfold, it was effective.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.900
It reminded all of us that the
woman who would go into office

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.100
if he lost was no saint, either.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.430
Not Hillary herself necessarily,
but her husband,

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.070
and with her enabling, really,
it must be said.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.930
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Thank you all very much.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.500
We appreciate it.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.700
&gt;&gt; It was perfect.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.570
And it was-- that, that, that
got us momentum.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:02.500
That gave us the velocity, that
gave us the muzzle velocity

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.900
to kind of drive home
in the last, you know,

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.530
five, four or five weeks
of the campaign.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.070
&gt;&gt; It's-- it was a show.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:14.070
First of all, it took some of
the attention away from Trump.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:17.430
What he's really good at in a,
in a fight

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.700
is muddying the,
muddying the waters,

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.530
muddying the truth,
muddying the focus to the point

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.200
where everybody just says,
"Ah, it's a wash ."

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.070
He's done this with the media
for years.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.870
"They say this about me, it's
not, I say this, you know,

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.670
people don't trust the media,
people don't trust Trump."

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.100
He knows that in the end, they
kind of throw up their hands

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.170
and and say,
"You deserve each other."

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.730
And that's fine with him.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.030
(laughter)

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.800
&gt;&gt; If the president thing
doesn't work out,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.170
I would love to see a reality
show where Donald Trump

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.630
and Billy Bush just travel
around the country in a bus.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.270
&gt;&gt; Take a Tic Tac and grab them
by the (bleep)

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.800
is the closest thing to a plan
Donald Trump has described

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.600
this entire election.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think that's
what Donald Trump's advisers

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.430
meant when they told him
to reach out to women.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.870
(groans, applause)

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.130
♪ ♪

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.970
(cheers and applause)

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.430
&gt;&gt; The decision desk has called
Pennsylvania for Donald Trump.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: On election night,
Trump's divisive campaign

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.000
paid off.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.800
&gt;&gt; This means that Donald Trump
will be

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.100
the 45th president
of the United States.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.770
The most unreal...

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The base,
energized,

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.900
narrowly put him over the top.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.930
&gt;&gt; In an Electoral College
victory that virtually no one

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.500
saw coming a year ago,
a few months ago--

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.200
even a month ago,
even yesterday...

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.230
&gt;&gt; Whoa, everyone got this
wrong.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.830
I mean, one percent
of the pollsters

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.000
and the prognosticators
called this.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.870
And everyone else was wrong.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.600
And this is a huge story.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.330
&gt;&gt; What Trump are we probably
going to see...

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.330
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump has broken the
rules...

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:57.970
&gt;&gt; There was a kind of prejudice
against Trump,

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:02.970
a kind of incredulity
in the parlors of Washington

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.900
and New York and Los Angeles.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.900
Somehow, this guy
who was so coarse

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:16.700
and so blatantly exploiting race
and division could actually win.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.700
&gt;&gt; How unpredictable the new
terrain here in Washington is.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.830
&gt;&gt; It speaks to how deeply
divided our nation is,

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.700
that you have two candidates

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.900
receive tens of millions
of votes,

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.870
a race that's separated
by just a handful of votes

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.200
in a handful of states.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.570
They care about Donald Trump.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.670
They like that guy, they want
him to be the president.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.670
And they want to beat
the Democrats.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.000
Crooked Hillary.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.500
&gt;&gt; The creation of a new
reality...

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.870
&gt;&gt; ...caught a political
earthquake

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.070
and unraveling at a system,
where even a revolution...

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.300
&gt;&gt; A President Trump is very
much a wild card.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.500
&gt;&gt; I don't think any of us
thought he was going to win.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.770
When he wins, if people are
being brutally honest,

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.870
there was a level, in large
measure, of disbelief.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.670
&gt;&gt; Is this our new normal?
Is there reason for concern?

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.100
&gt;&gt; The sheer unpredictability of
a President Donald Trump.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:09.330
&gt;&gt; Even for him, it was a little
of an overwhelming feeling

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.930
to see yourself be elected
president of the United States

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.430
and realize that you're going to
be the next commander-in-chief,

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.130
the next leader of the free
world.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.970
It's a humbling, humbling thing.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.630
&gt;&gt; 2016 changed the face of
American politics forever.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After a polarizing
campaign,

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:31.000
he would need an acceptance
speech to signal to the country,

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.500
to an anxious Wall Street,
and the world...

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.570
&gt;&gt; A case of disruption coming
to Washington.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: ...what kind of
president he would be.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.230
&gt;&gt; I remember calling him on his
cell phone

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:43.570
when the futures were down--

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.030
Bloomberg was reporting that
stock futures were down 600

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.600
as a result of his victory.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.600
And I remember saying to him,
"Hey, we got to put some stuff

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.000
in there that are sensitizing
to the markets,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.030
to let people know things
are going to be okay."

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.070
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But Steve Bannon
didn't want things to be okay.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:02.930
He went to work on a speech
that would emphasize division,

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:06.400
give the base what it wanted.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.070
&gt;&gt; And I start working on it,
like at, you know,

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.970
1:00, 12:00, 1:00
in the morning.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.900
It was, "Go to Washington,
and we're going to burn out

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.600
the permanent political class.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.100
We're going to take a torch
to the enemy."

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.870
Okay? That...
it was fire-breathing.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.930
(crowd chanting "U.S.A.")

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But having won,
Trump wavered.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.970
He would sound

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:30.570
uncharacteristically
conciliatory.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:36.000
&gt;&gt; Now it's time for America to
bind the wounds of division;

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.300
have to get together.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.500
To all Republicans and Democrats
and independents

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:47.900
across this nation, I say it is
time for us to come together

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.570
as one united people.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.370
(cheers and applause)

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.670
&gt;&gt; You never see the Trump
victory night speech

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.270
ever replayed.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.930
Because it's just not Trump.

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.230
It's not a-- it's kind of like,
"Let's have a group hug."

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:04.470
(cheers and applause)

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.730
&gt;&gt; For those who have chosen not
to support me in the past,

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.300
of which there were
a few people...

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.470
(laughter)

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.330
I'm reaching out to you
for your guidance

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.670
and your help so that we can
work together

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.100
and unify our great country.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.200
(cheers and applause)

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.530
&gt;&gt; I said, "No, no, no, no,
we didn't win an election

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.900
to bring the country together.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.400
It's not time to bring
the country together,

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.730
it's time to take on the elites
in this country,

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.200
take the torch to them.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.400
Hit them with a blowtorch."

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.800
&gt;&gt; I love this country.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.400
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.970
(cheers and applause)

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.230
&gt;&gt; I saw him, not only then, but
after he returned to Trump Tower

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.530
that night.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.600
And the weight of the election,
the, the processing

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.900
of recognizing what was about
to happen,

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.530
was clearly going through his
mind at that time.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:04.730
You could-- you could see how
profound the moment was.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.600
&gt;&gt; I think there was a little
bit of shock,

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.070
uh, there, a moment of
vulnerability.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:12.730
He said he was literally going
to act more presidential

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.270
than Abraham Lincoln.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.070
I mean, we laughed,
but he meant it seriously.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.730
You know, he was going to dial
back on Twitter,

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:24.500
dial up on presidential nature,
if you will.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In his next public
appearance,

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.800
it was toned-down Trump again.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.130
In the Oval Office.

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.530
No sign of the brutal
divisiveness

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.030
that had gotten him there.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:36.700
&gt;&gt; Well, I just had the
opportunity

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.970
to have an excellent
conversation with

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.170
President-elect Trump.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.700
&gt;&gt; To see the two of them in the
Oval Office was kind of

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.870
the, you know,
the final moment of,

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.130
how in the world
did this happen?

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.330
And what have we just gone
through?

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:55.870
&gt;&gt; Been very encouraged by the,
I think, interest in President,

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:57.930
President-elect Trump's.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.970
I believe that it is
important...

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.030
&gt;&gt; Trump is totally
disinterested

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.300
in the gravity of the job
he's walking into.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.770
Just doesn't care, you know.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Ben Rhodes was one
of Obama's closest aides.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.600
&gt;&gt; You know, I think for Obama,
it was like a gut punch.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.900
Obama's seeing this meeting as
an opportunity,

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.000
"I need to tell him
about all these things,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.300
you know, how healthcare works
in this country,

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.800
North Korean threat,
what's going on with Iran."

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.370
And Trump is totally
disinterested in any of this.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.570
Didn't even care.

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In front of the
cameras,

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:36.300
the reality TV star smiled
and tried out his new role.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.400
&gt;&gt; We were just going to get to
know each other.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.370
We had never met each other.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.300
I have great respect.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.900
The meeting lasted for almost
an hour and a half.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.500
And it could have--
as far as I'm concerned,

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.070
it could have gone on
for a lot longer.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.500
&gt;&gt; The Donald Trump who came to
the Oval Office on November 10,

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.800
two days after Election Day,

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.030
seemed like a very different
Donald Trump.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.530
He spoke very respectfully of
President Obama,

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.730
who he had questioned whether he
was a legitimate president,

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:02.530
to the birther issue.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.200
But here he was saying he
greatly admired President Obama.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.000
So for someone who's just heard
Trump talk on the campaign,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.730
it seemed like an out-of-body
experience.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.530
&gt;&gt; And I look forward to being
with you many, many more times

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.970
in the future.
Thank you.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:15.530
(reporters clamoring)

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you, everybody.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.700
We're not--
we are not going to...

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.230
&gt;&gt; And there was an idea,
for a brief moment,

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.800
that he was about to pivot,

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.000
that he was about to be
"presidential."

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.330
He would show us all that he was
capable of uniting America

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:35.500
and speaking to everybody
at once.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But before long,
the anger, resentment, conflict

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.570
that had put Donald Trump in
power would return.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.970
It erupted after one decisive
meeting.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:48.300
&gt;&gt; ...between the president-
elect and top intelligence...

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.300
&gt;&gt; President-elect Trump is
about to get all of the details

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.900
from U.S. intelligence chiefs.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That day,
the powerful leaders

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:58.900
of the intelligence community
arrived at Trump Tower.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:03.800
They came, evidence in hand,
to convince the president-elect

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.130
the Russians really had
interfered in the election.

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.330
&gt;&gt; ... for what could be a day
of fireworks here

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:09.970
at Trump Tower.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:11.970
&gt;&gt; He came to identify
the question

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.400
of the Russian intervention
in the election

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.370
as a questioning of his own
election as president.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:22.100
And so he, from the very
beginning, refused to treat this

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.930
in a way that I think any other
president would have--

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:27.500
which is as a serious attack

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.000
on the U.S. and its election
integrity--

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.100
but chose to view it in very
personalized terms.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.000
&gt;&gt; The officials say they'll
present him

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.570
with classified material...

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:38.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it only got
more personal.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:41.770
After the briefing,
FBI director James Comey

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.900
spoke to Trump privately.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.900
&gt;&gt; Comey pulls the president
aside, and he tells him,

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:54.430
"Hey, listen, uh, I need you
to know that there's this"--

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:56.630
what we now call the "dossier."

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.430
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The dossier:

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:01.870
unverified and sensational
allegations

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:04.700
prepared by a former
British spy--

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.900
partially paid for
by the Democrats.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.730
It was political dynamite.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.630
&gt;&gt; "Russian regime has been
cultivating, supporting,

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.030
and assisting Trump
for at least five years."

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:19.330
&gt;&gt; It's full of things that may
be able

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.070
to allow the Russians
to blackmail him.

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.770
It has information about him

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.500
involved in perverted
sexual acts.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.230
&gt;&gt; "To exploit Trump's personal
obsessions

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.430
and sexual perversion in order
to obtain

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:37.570
suitable kompromat, compromising
material, on him."

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:43.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After the meeting,
the president-elect was furious.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.430
&gt;&gt; Trump is talking
to his top aides

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:50.630
and he views this as blackmail.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.800
"It's a shakedown,"
he tells them.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:59.600
His assumption is that Comey is
giving this to him to show him

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.600
that he's got something on him.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Then news
of the briefing leaked.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.970
&gt;&gt; This is CNN breaking news.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:11.270
&gt;&gt; CNN has learned that the
nation's top

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.330
intelligence officials provided
information

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.930
to President-elect Donald...

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.270
&gt;&gt; There's the controversial
move by Buzzfeed last night,

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.170
publishing a dossier...

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Before long, the
entire dossier was online.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.330
&gt;&gt; But they have been detailed
by numerous media outlets,

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.800
including Buzzfeed...

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump's chief
strategist, Steve Bannon,

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.630
told the president-elect
he knew what was going on.

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.230
Bannon himself had used
Breitbart

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.370
to wage harsh
right-wing attacks.

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:42.230
Now, Bannon said, the mainstream
media was going after Trump.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:45.800
&gt;&gt; This is what scumbags
the mainstream media are.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.330
And how gutless they are.

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:49.870
Buzzfeed...

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.000
Buzzfeed, the standard of
excellence in journalism

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.370
in our country,
prints the dossier, with a link.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:58.900
And I said, "Here it goes."

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.270
Because then the "New York
Times," the "Washington Post,"

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.400
so on, it's all bang, bang,
bang, bang,

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.500
they're reporting this was given
to the president, right?

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
He wasn't even president

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.230
and already Trump
was under siege.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.930
&gt;&gt; The president-elect
must have concluded

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:18.630
that the press was going to be
an adversarial,

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.770
confrontational force, this is
even before he took office,

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.470
and that the press had sources
that could undermine him,

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.270
sources that knew what he was
doing,

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:29.000
even if he was privately meeting
with the FBI director.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.030
I think that set the tone for
what was to follow.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.230
(applause)

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Now, it was back to
what Trump did best.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:39.870
At a press conference
the very next day,

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:46.030
he gave his base what they had
come to expect: he attacked.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.830
&gt;&gt; I think it was disgraceful--
disgraceful--

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:52.970
that the intelligence agencies
allowed any information,

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:56.130
that turned out to be so false
and fake, out.

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:57.330
&gt;&gt; He expresses frustration.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.970
He knows it's a set-up.

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:02.570
He knows it's a plot to destroy
him, and people around him.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.270
&gt;&gt; And that's something that
Nazi Germany

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.300
would have done and did do.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.930
I think it's a disgrace.

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.530
&gt;&gt; Trump, I think because of the
dossier

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:12.000
and the leak of the dossier,
was so furious

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.170
that he just came out
and lashed out at everybody.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:16.300
And I think that sort
of set the tone

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.130
for the entire administration,
to be honest.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:21.600
&gt;&gt; That information that was
false and fake

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.030
and never happened got released
to the public...

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.900
&gt;&gt; I think that was a signal
to everybody,

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.700
certainly to me and the rest
of the media,

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.370
that this was the Trump
we were going to get

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.200
in the White House--
that it wasn't going to be

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.130
any sort of a reset.

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:34.800
It was going to be the angry,

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.400
same, the same Trump that was
out there on the campaign,

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.800
campaign trail.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.700
&gt;&gt; Can you give us a question?
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump made it
clear: the press was the enemy.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.500
&gt;&gt; No, not you.
Not you.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.600
&gt;&gt; Can you give us a chance?

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.270
&gt;&gt; Your organization is
terrible.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:48.930
&gt;&gt; You're attacking our news
organization.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:50.600
Can you give us a chance to ask
a question, sir?

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.670
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.
Quiet. Quiet.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:54.070
Go ahead-- she's asking
a question, don't be rude.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:55.730
&gt;&gt; Mr. President-elect.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:57.400
Can you give us a question?
You're attacking us.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He then deployed
a weapon

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.630
designed to undermine
the media-- a catchphrase.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.530
&gt;&gt; Can you state
categorically...

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.600
&gt;&gt; You are fake news.
Go ahead.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.400
&gt;&gt; It was really extraordinary
watching Donald Trump take

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.330
"fake news,"
the term "fake news,"

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.870
and adopt it as his own critique
of the media.

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:18.100
He has created this alternative
reality that allows him

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.870
to dismiss or discredit anything
that is negative

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.530
while pushing his own narrative.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.170
&gt;&gt; But I will tell you,
some of the media outlets

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:28.230
that I deal with are fake news,
more so than anybody.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.930
I could name them,
but I won't bother,

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:31.970
but you have a few sitting
right in front of us.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:35.000
So they're very, very dishonest
people.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.400
&gt;&gt; He used it as a way, again,
to divide the country,

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:46.130
to energize his supporters,
and to cast himself as somebody

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:51.330
who is under siege by,
you know, an establishment

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:54.330
or an elite whose interests are
counter to the people

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:55.770
who elected Donald Trump.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.300
And, frankly,
very effectively done.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.770
&gt;&gt; It's all fake news.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:00.900
It's phony stuff.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.630
It didn't happen.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.430
&gt;&gt; He's a brilliant marketer.

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:10.000
And he knew that with the drop
in credibility of the media,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.170
and the increase in skepticism
and cynicism from the public,

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.870
that he was able to get away
with much more.

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:19.770
He was able to say things that
no other president had said,

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.570
and to be able to challenge
the press directly.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.930
&gt;&gt; This fake news was indeed
fake news.

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:26.370
&gt;&gt; Sir, you did not answer...

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:28.130
Sir, you did not answer whether
any of your associates

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:30.130
were in contact
with the Russians.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:33.300
Sir, you did not answer,
you did not answer

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.230
whether any of your associates
were in contact

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.570
with the Russians.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.770
Can you categorically deny
that did not happen, sir?

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.500
Can you categorically deny that
that did not happen, sir?

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.370
(cheers and applause)

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:46.530
("Hail to the Chief" playing)

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.200
&gt;&gt; The world is watching
our country today.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.700
&gt;&gt; Trump is set to become
America's 45th president today.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As he took the oath
of office,

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:57.200
Donald Trump made no pretense
of seeking unity or healing.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.100
He spoke directly to his base.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.230
&gt;&gt; The forgotten men and women
of our country

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:05.230
will be forgotten no longer.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:07.830
(cheers and applause)

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:11.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He framed the
conflict "us versus them."

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:15.200
&gt;&gt; Their victories have not been
your victories;

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.800
their triumphs have not been
your triumphs.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.730
(cheers and applause)

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.830
&gt;&gt; He very much made
accentuating the divide

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:25.930
part of his campaign strategy,
and even more incredibly,

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:28.300
part of his governing
strategies.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.730
I think he is the first
president who arrived

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:36.830
explicitly understanding,
and even seeking

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.730
to speak only to his base.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:43.470
(crowd chanting)

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But that very day,
he would be confronted

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.600
by the other side of the divide.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.930
&gt;&gt; ...and they got their moment,
and I have to tell you,

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:54.470
we are just passing Trump Hotel,
we did pass protesters,

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:57.570
so you could hear the din
of the people...

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.170
&gt;&gt; We are next, right across the
street from the hotel--

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.930
there's a huge group
of protesters

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.500
combined with supporters,
and they've been very vocal,

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.770
and we've seen a few flare-ups.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.030
&gt;&gt; It looks like they're going
back to the car.

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.970
&gt;&gt; So, Lester, there is a change
of plans now, I believe.

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:17.630
He is back in his vehicle.

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was a sign of
the anger also deepening

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.570
on the left.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:24.200
The mood that day went
from peaceful protests...

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.370
&gt;&gt; Trump and Pence are fascists!
&gt;&gt; What?

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.430
&gt;&gt; Trump and Pence are...
&gt;&gt; Illegitimate!

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:32.070
&gt;&gt; Trump and Pence are fascists!

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To stand-offs...

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:38.400
(people shouting)

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.630
(tear gas canisters popping)

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:46.070
(officers shouting)

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:47.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To violent
provocation.

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.900
(shouting, cheering)

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:56.770
(sirens blaring)

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:59.370
(people shouting)

00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:07.730
♪ ♪

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:11.430
(sirens blaring)

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:12.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By the next day,

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:15.430
hundreds of thousands of
peaceful protesters

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:17.200
overwhelmed Washington.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.770
&gt;&gt; The resistance will be
televised.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:20.230
Live from Washington, D.C...

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:22.670
&gt;&gt; One of the largest single-day
protests in American history,

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:25.870
speaking out against Donald
Trump just one day

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:27.400
after he took office.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.830
&gt;&gt; We want a leader!
Not a tweeter!

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.330
We want a leader!

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:34.730
&gt;&gt; The day after
the inauguration...

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:37.130
&gt;&gt; (chanting)

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.270
&gt;&gt; There were more people who
showed up on the National Mall

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.170
in Washington
for the Women's March

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:45.300
than there had been
the day before,

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.970
when a new president
was inaugurated.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.470
&gt;&gt; Pence sucks, too!

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.400
Pence sucks, too!

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.230
&gt;&gt; When you had the Women's
March

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.270
and the hundreds of thousands
of people

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:58.570
out in the streets...

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:00.700
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump has got to go!

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.000
&gt;&gt; In Washington,
in cities around the country,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.330
in places around the world...

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:10.670
There was an energy created
by his election.

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:13.270
That energy began to course
through the political system.

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:16.630
And you could see that
with the Women's March.

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:18.570
&gt;&gt; There will be a debate about
the size of the crowd,

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.070
these protesters saying that
they're going to have

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:22.800
a bigger crowd here today than
Donald Trump had

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.970
of his supporters
at his inaugural yesterday.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:25.470
We'll let that debate play out.

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:29.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The protests, the
women, then the breaking point:

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:33.970
the news about the size of the
crowd at his inauguration.

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:36.270
&gt;&gt; Former President Obama on the
left, and Trump's inauguration,

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.870
we're there on the right,
with far fewer spectators.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.200
&gt;&gt; Literally from the exact same
vantage point

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.070
showing a big difference
in the size of the crowd.

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.500
&gt;&gt; There were big holes
in the crowd,

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.930
so those are the comparisons
right there.

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.830
&gt;&gt; Paling in comparison to
President Obama's.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.770
&gt;&gt; Take a look at that exact
same image from today.

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:54.600
I was, we saw a lot fewer,
we saw fewer people.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.900
&gt;&gt; Visually at least?
It was smaller...

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.470
&gt;&gt; I think it's safe to say
there was light turnout.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:01.630
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump is, is a TV guy.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:04.900
He has always been concerned
with his ratings,

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.770
and with numeric values
of winning versus losing.

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:12.200
So the notion of having
a, a smaller crowd

00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.700
than somebody else,
uh, just eats at him.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: On their first day
in the White House,

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.900
press aide Cliff Sims saw
Trump's frustration up close.

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.730
&gt;&gt; Within the first, you know,
five minutes

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:26.070
that I'm in the building,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.800
there's this kind
of crisis moment.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.530
There was a lot of reporting
that the inaugural crowds

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:34.370
for him were not as big as
the inaugural crowds for Obama.

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:37.530
That is the equivalent
for Donald Trump

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:39.630
of a schoolyard fight,

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.430
so they were really
coming after him,

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.800
hitting him where it hurts.

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.630
&gt;&gt; And he starts insisting,
"That's not true.

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:47.800
We have the biggest crowd ever."

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.570
He tells Sean Spicer, his press
secretary,

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:51.130
"You go out there
and tell them that."

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.400
And it sets the tone.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.930
It sets the tone
from the beginning.

00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:55.470
You know, this is not about
healing,

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.030
this is not about bringing
people together.

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:01.830
&gt;&gt; Sean, first day on the job,
is thinking to himself,

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:04.770
"Here's my chance to kind of
show I'm tough.

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:07.170
I'm going to punch back ten
times harder than they hit us.

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:09.900
Let's figure out
how to do that."

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.930
I grab a computer, start, you
know, pecking out a statement.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This was the
statement they drafted.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.870
Almost every fact about
the crowd size was wrong.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:21.400
&gt;&gt; We were so caught up in the
moment,

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.570
and Sean's trying to impress
the president.

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.570
And I'm being told facts
that end up not being true,

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:28.870
which we didn't vet properly.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:36.030
Sean was basically like marching
out to his own death there.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:39.070
&gt;&gt; Good evening.
Thank you guys for coming.

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:41.130
&gt;&gt; At least,
his credibility's death.

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:42.930
&gt;&gt; Photographs of the inaugural
proceedings

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:46.330
were intentionally framed in a
way, in one particular tweet,

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.730
to minimize the enormous support
that had gathered

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.300
on the National Mall.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.970
&gt;&gt; And only a fool would have
gone out there

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.870
kind of half-cocked the way
that we did.

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:57.030
And we were those fools.

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.900
&gt;&gt; This was the largest audience
to ever witness

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.270
an inauguration, period,

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:04.130
both in person
and around the globe.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.170
Even "The New York Times"...

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:07.030
&gt;&gt; When he goes out and says,

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:09.370
"This is the biggest crowd size
ever"...

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:11.100
&gt;&gt; A misrepresentation of the
crowd...

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.470
&gt;&gt; What he's saying,
in essence, is,

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.500
"What's true is what the leader
says is true."

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:23.330
The obliteration of the line
between truth and the lie

00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:27.370
is fundamental to grasp

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:31.730
because it's so elemental
to a functioning democracy.

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:34.730
And the degradation of those
institutions

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:39.630
is a weakening of our system.

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.670
&gt;&gt; Did you lie on his behalf?

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:42.970
&gt;&gt; No.

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.000
&gt;&gt; Never?

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:44.970
&gt;&gt; No.

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:49.430
There were plenty of times
when...

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:51.070
Look, your, your job...

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:55.200
You may not go, go full-on,
but I don't think that that's...

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.430
You're... I think I...

00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:59.730
The job of the press secretary
is to articulate

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:02.970
what the principal
wants articulated.

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:05.200
Not what you want-- you're not
there to call balls and strikes

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.030
and interpret.

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.430
That's what you guys should be
writing and covering,

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:14.600
instead of sowing division about
tweets and false narratives.

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.700
I will see you on Monday.

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.200
(reporters clamoring)

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.200
&gt;&gt; Sean?
&gt;&gt; Women's March.

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.400
&gt;&gt; How about the Obamacare
changes?

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.630
&gt;&gt; What we learned in those
first days

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:29.530
of the Trump presidency was the
degree to which Donald Trump

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.770
was going to insist on trying
to write the history

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:35.030
of his presidency
the way he wanted to.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.500
That if you spoke
for Donald Trump,

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.900
you had a constituency of one,
and that was Donald Trump.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.330
&gt;&gt; What it... you're saying it's
a falsehood,

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:44.000
and they're giving-- Sean
Spicer, our press secretary,

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.370
gave alternative facts to that.

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:47.670
But the point remains...

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:49.730
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute--
alternative facts?

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:52.170
Alternative facts-- four of the
five facts he uttered...

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:54.530
&gt;&gt; Hey, Chuck, why...
Hey, Chuck...

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.570
&gt;&gt; The one thing he got right
was Zeke Miller.

00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:58.730
Four of the five facts he
uttered were just not true.

00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.300
Look, "alternative facts" are
not facts-- they're falsehoods.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; I mean, the obvious impact
is that it's created

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.670
a tremendously dangerous,
unstable force

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.070
in American life, where people
don't know what to believe.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.370
People have been told they're
right not to believe the things

01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:14.570
they are told by credible
sources.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:17.300
The president of the United
States has contributed mightily

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.830
to an environment
where people believe

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:21.370
what they want to believe,

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:25.470
and that is going to have
long-term repercussions.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:27.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Trump didn't let it go.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.570
The fight over crowd size
resonated with his base

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:32.770
and the "us versus them" war he
was waging.

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:34.630
&gt;&gt; Just before we leave, the
president tells us he wants

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.970
to show us just one more image.

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:40.130
&gt;&gt; One thing this shows is how
far over they go here.

01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:41.930
Look. Look how far this is.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.700
This goes all the way down here,
all the way down.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.870
Nobody sees that.

01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:47.500
You don't see that in the
pictures.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.600
But when you look at this
tremendous sea of love--

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.530
I call it a sea of love--
it's really something special.

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.800
&gt;&gt; It really did become
emblematic

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.130
of what the Trump presidency
was to, to be,

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:04.370
in that nothing was accepted
at face value.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.830
It was kind of a warning sign

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.730
that, not to take your eye off
this ball,

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:13.630
because it's going to be
different from now on.

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.600
And it has been.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.770
(audience laughing)

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:21.530
&gt;&gt; He's focused on the size
of his crowds,

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:23.500
the size of his ratings, the
size of his hands,

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.930
the size of, well, everything
and...

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:27.470
(audience laughs)

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:29.030
&gt;&gt; Either that's a lot
of empty space,

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.470
or that crowd is even whiter
than I thought.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:33.970
(audience laughs)

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:36.030
&gt;&gt; You just couldn't see Trump's
crowd

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.630
because they were wearing
polar bear skins.

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:41.170
(audience laughs)

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump's first acts
as president

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.530
were also meant to stoke
conflict.

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:54.570
&gt;&gt; Next is an executive order
minimizing the economic burden

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:56.870
of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:58.130
pending repeal.

01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He signed a raft of
executive orders

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.300
on some of the most
divisive issues

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.200
in American life and politics.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.730
&gt;&gt; ...have teed up more than
200 possible executive orders

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:07.100
for the new president...

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.300
NARRATOR: On Obamacare.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.930
&gt;&gt; ...associated with
Obamacare...

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:11.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The environment.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.670
&gt;&gt; ...speeding up environmental
reviews...

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:13.670
NARRATOR: Immigration.

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:14.870
&gt;&gt; Signing an executive order...

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:16.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And the border
wall.

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.830
&gt;&gt; I do think that they wanted
to have a flurry of activity

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:20.530
at the beginning to demonstrate
that Trump

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.000
is what he said he was.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.370
He's not going to wait, he's not
going to take his time.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:25.930
He knows what to do and he's
going to fix everything--

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:29.370
he's going to set the world
right immediately.

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:31.970
&gt;&gt; The message is,
"It's a crisis, we're at work."

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:33.400
And we're driving this.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.330
Donald Trump's president
of the United States.

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:40.270
Now comes the hour of action--
there's been enough talk.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:42.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Steve Bannon kept
a list on his office wall

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.270
of the promises
that the president

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.800
was trying to deliver on.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.670
&gt;&gt; The people talk all the time
about everything that Trump does

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.700
politically is a base play.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.930
Since Steve Bannon
being the example

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.730
of the one who encourages him
to, you know,

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:56.330
"Let's play to the base.
Let's play to the base.

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:57.630
Let's play to the base."

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:01.230
They feel vindicated that 2016
showed

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:05.330
that if you energize a sliver
of the country,

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:09.200
that that can be more powerful
than kind of having this,

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.730
you know, more even-keel message
that we're going to appeal

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:13.730
to a little bit of everyone.

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:17.000
Steve Bannon, I think,
rejects that premise.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.300
And he says that "I'm all about
energizing this sliver.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.600
And that that's the way to win."

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The most explosive
executive order--

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:28.670
crafted to create
shock and awe--

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:30.200
was aimed at blocking people

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.630
from seven predominantly
Muslim countries

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.200
from entering the United States.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.370
&gt;&gt; Everybody understood what
the travel ban was designed,

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.770
in fact, to do.

01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:42.670
They understood the symbolism,
they understood the message

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:45.130
that it sent to his base.

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:48.670
And what they were saying was,
"Promise made, promise kept."

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:51.430
&gt;&gt; "Protection of the nation
from foreign terrorists

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:57.000
entering into
the United States."

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.100
It's big stuff.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The reaction from
the other side was immediate:

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:05.070
more outrage.
(protesters chanting)

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:07.770
&gt;&gt; A scene of outrage at JFK
Airport in New York, where...

01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.300
&gt;&gt; Protests all across
the country,

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.070
reaction from around the world,
after the president...

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:14.930
&gt;&gt; As a symbolic issue to his
base and to his opponents,

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:17.470
as a marker in American life

01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:18.970
and in the American
political debate,

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:20.500
I mean, we moved into an
entirely different

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.630
dark kind of period.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.630
And I think its, its
significance

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:26.830
is hard to overstate.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:29.330
&gt;&gt; Swift reaction from around
the country...

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:33.970
&gt;&gt; Now protests, outrage,
and backlash from President...

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:35.770
&gt;&gt; These actions that Trump does
to appease his base

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:38.100
and to excite his base

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.670
have incited the resistance
against him.

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.630
&gt;&gt; No ban! No wall!

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.830
&gt;&gt; The travel ban is one of the
most important days

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:48.270
in the Trump presidency.

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:50.400
Not just because
of the policy itself

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.770
and what it says about us
as Americans--

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:56.170
much less the people themselves
who are now imperiled,

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:58.130
unclear if they could come to
the United States...

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:00.500
&gt;&gt; (chanting)

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.100
&gt;&gt; But it was the thousands of
people rushing the airports.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.500
&gt;&gt; In Seattle, police actually
dispersed some crowds

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.400
with pepper spray.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.030
It was a day of high drama...

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.730
&gt;&gt; It was the day when it felt
like democracy

01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.170
may be crumbling at its seams...

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:17.570
&gt;&gt; No bans! No walls!

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:21.630
&gt;&gt; And what might still be here
when we wake up in the morning?

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.700
There's going to be 7,000 people
at LaGuardia

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:26.670
and at DCA and at Dulles?

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:28.300
Are they going to start
storming the gates

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.830
and seizing refugees
from TSA agents?

01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:32.570
&gt;&gt; Let them go!
&gt;&gt; Right now!

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.730
&gt;&gt; Let them go!

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.230
&gt;&gt; It, it struck me that this
administration

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.370
was going to be a lot different
than any other we had seen.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:42.330
That they were simply not going
to abide by any type of process,

01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:44.430
that there was a certain amount
of spontaneity

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.870
and impulsiveness about
the way this administration

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:48.300
was going to operate.

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.770
&gt;&gt; The people united
will never be divided!

01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:56.600
The people united
will never be divided!

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.130
&gt;&gt; The president will meet with
more Republicans in Congress...

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:01.470
&gt;&gt; President Trump will meet
with conservative leaders

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:02.930
to talk about healthcare
today...

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:05.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He had incited
conflict with the travel ban,

01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:06.670
and now he would move on to

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:11.100
another polarizing issue:
Obamacare.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.170
&gt;&gt; The Republican Party had for
three elections in a row

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.200
run on the repeal of Obamacare.

01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:18.770
Which, I think there was
a sense that,

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.100
"Hey, we owe our electorate--

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.800
they put us here
for this reason."

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To get it done,
Trump would rely

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.970
on Speaker Paul Ryan and
the Republican establishment.

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:32.170
&gt;&gt; In the sequencing,
repeal and replace,

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:33.300
and that's where the
establishment,

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.030
and Ryan says, "I got this."

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:36.900
We've voted 50 times.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.130
50 times to repeal this.

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:40.770
This is something we own.

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:43.400
We know this better
than anybody.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.970
&gt;&gt; President Trump met earlier
this evening

01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:46.730
with members of the Freedom
Caucus to discuss...

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:48.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
But like the travel ban,

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:51.970
Trump's effort was immediately
mired in angry opposition.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:53.770
&gt;&gt; There's still half
of America,

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:55.530
which is a significant
percentage,

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:57.470
that did not vote for Trump,
did not vote

01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:02.430
for Republicans in Congress, and
did want to repair Obamacare,

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:03.430
but didn't want to dump it.

01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:07.170
And when you start with the most
contentious issue,

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:08.700
what are you going to get?

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.970
(crowd clamoring)

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.470
&gt;&gt; All around the country,

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:17.700
you had these, these hugely
energized town halls,

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.600
and legislators would go home
and get screamed at...

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.170
&gt;&gt; (yelling)

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:25.200
&gt;&gt; ...by constituents who were
terrified

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.070
they were going to take away
their healthcare.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.500
&gt;&gt; (chanting)

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.530
&gt;&gt; Things like--
had the Resist movement

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:34.130
and the protesters around the
building.

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:36.570
&gt;&gt; The problem is Obamacare has
just collapsed.

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:38.630
(crowd yelling and booing)

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:40.400
&gt;&gt; There's just a huge reaction.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.200
I had town halls with people in
churches swearing

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.970
and lobbing f-bombs
at the pastor,

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:46.400
if that helps set the tone...

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.700
(crowd yelling angrily)

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.630
I'd try to finish sentences on
healthcare, et cetera.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:53.630
Whatever, folks were just...

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:54.770
(growling in imitation)

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.230
&gt;&gt; (chanting): Read our
questions!

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.070
&gt;&gt; That's what we were facing,
right?

01:07:58.070 --> 01:07:58.870
People were saying "You're going
to take away healthcare

01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:00.730
for millions," and, like...

01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:02.200
(growls): "Boo," you know?

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.930
So it was hard to have a
rational dialogue-- still is.

01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:07.700
(crowd yelling)

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.430
&gt;&gt; (chanting): Shame on you!

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:12.730
&gt;&gt; They were kicking a hornets'
nest of millions of Americans

01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:14.370
who were now terrified
that they could lose

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.030
their health insurance coverage.

01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:19.500
&gt;&gt; And take the billionaires'
money and give it to...

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.300
&gt;&gt; It just created an
environment

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.100
that I also don't think
Republicans were really

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.870
politically ready for.

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:27.200
&gt;&gt; Single-payer,
run by the government?

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.030
Oh, yeah, it's got problems,
but it's also got elections,

01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:33.600
and you're going to find that
out in 2018!

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.900
&gt;&gt; What Trump has done is made
Obamacare popular.

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.870
&gt;&gt; The reality is that Obamacare
is...

01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:39.800
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump's frustration
grew as the legislation

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.530
became bogged down.

01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:43.600
&gt;&gt; New legislation that
is twice as popular

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.230
as the president...

01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:46.430
&gt;&gt; The vagaries of the
legislative process

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:48.030
are lost on him.

01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:50.330
On "The Apprentice," you just
simply say, "You're fired,"

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:51.600
and that's the end of it.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.000
The idea of working with a
legislature is kind of,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.100
it's a mystery to him.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.000
And so, "How is it these
Republicans can't get this done?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.070
What is it you're doing,
Paul Ryan?

01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:03.070
You told me you were going
to get this done."

01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:05.130
&gt;&gt; Repeal and replace
becomes a fiasco.

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:07.330
They're totally and completely
incompetent.

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:09.200
They're not ready to govern.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.300
They're just not ready
to govern.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.430
&gt;&gt; The Senate is scheduled to
vote on the latest version

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.600
of the bill to replace
Obamacare...

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump watched as
the Senate prepared

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:20.630
for a crucial vote
on healthcare reform.

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:23.030
&gt;&gt; A vote on healthcare, a vote
that's too close to call

01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:24.530
at this point...

01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:27.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The key vote--
Republican Senator John McCain,

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:30.100
a long-time Trump adversary.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.900
&gt;&gt; He is expected to show up
at Capitol Hill today

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.000
to cast what is expected to be
a yes vote on healthcare...

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.070
&gt;&gt; The clerk will call the roll.

01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:38.330
&gt;&gt; It was the most dramatic
night on the Senate floor

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:41.600
I had seen in all my years
up there.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.070
&gt;&gt; Mr. Barrasso.

01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:45.230
&gt;&gt; The vote's ticking away, the
vote's ticking away.

01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:49.170
And McCain's on the floor,
but he's not voting.

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:51.270
&gt;&gt; Mr. Blunt.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.130
Mr. Booker.

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:55.630
&gt;&gt; You saw Mitch McConnell
looking more and more unhappy,

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:57.100
his arms were closed.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.300
And you could tell from the body
language on the Republican side

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.200
that they were very worried.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.470
&gt;&gt; Mr. Durbin.

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:06.030
&gt;&gt; John McCain walks up to where
the vote clerks are

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:09.570
and he lifts his hand very
dramatically.

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:12.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: McCain,
with a thumbs-down gesture,

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.630
shocked the chamber.

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:16.930
(people gasping)

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:21.470
&gt;&gt; You could hear audible gasps
in the chamber.

01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:27.330
And those gasps of surprise came
from both sides of the aisle.

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:29.100
&gt;&gt; No.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.770
(people gasping)

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:33.000
&gt;&gt; In the Senate chambers,
you could hear the shock--

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.370
first gasps...

01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:36.200
&gt;&gt; Another devastating blow to
Republican senators

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.300
as an Obamacare repeal fails...

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.430
&gt;&gt; Nobody was expecting John
McCain to vote no,

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:44.570
and the way that he did
obviously had ramifications

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:47.400
not just in the Senate
or in Congress,

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.400
but in the White House as well.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.800
And how-- it would make
everything more difficult

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.770
because members are fighting
with each other now.

01:10:56.770 --> 01:10:58.270
&gt;&gt; Breaking news right now.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:00.900
The Republicans' Obamacare
repeal failed in the Senate

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.500
tonight, the vote 49 to 51...

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.830
&gt;&gt; The dramatic collapse of the
healthcare effort...

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The president had
been watching on television.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.100
&gt;&gt; We were in the dining room
off the Oval Office.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.900
There was profound
disappointment that we were

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.200
that close, and that had spent
a lot of effort

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.570
really believing that we could
finally do something

01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:18.770
when it comes to healthcare.

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:21.130
&gt;&gt; Republicans tried and have
failed again...

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:22.770
&gt;&gt; And so it was just huge
disappointment.

01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:25.070
&gt;&gt; We are continuing to follow
breaking news on Capitol Hill,

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:28.430
where lawmakers dealt a serious
blow to the president's...

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:30.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: His first major
legislative effort

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.730
went down in defeat.

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:34.030
&gt;&gt; Trump was angry.

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:37.100
He was angry because he was
failing as a president.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.330
All he had to do was
click on cable news

01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:42.070
to see that he wasn't being
portrayed

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:44.430
as, as the winning,
swashbuckling,

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:47.600
powerful president
he wanted to be.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
It was a decisive moment.

01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:52.430
He would have to unleash
his attack politics

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:56.700
onto the Republican
establishment itself.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.000
&gt;&gt; He goes with the corrupt,
feckless Republican

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.930
establishment instincts for the
first couple of months

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:04.700
of his presidency,
and it backfires.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.030
What other conclusion
could he draw other than,

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.300
"Now it's time to try
some stuff on my own"?

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.800
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This time,
he turned to the base.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.630
Spoke to them directly.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.770
&gt;&gt; "You can thank Congress, the
same people

01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:18.200
that can't even give us Hcare!"
(tweets)

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.400
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He targeted
Congressional Republicans,

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.200
especially leader
Mitch McConnell.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.930
&gt;&gt; "Senator Mitch McConnell said
I had 'excessive expectations,'

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:28.200
but I don't think so.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.330
After seven years of hearing
Repeal &amp; Replace,

01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:33.300
why not done?"
(tweets)

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.570
&gt;&gt; The president's frustration
was not subtle, right?

01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:37.630
Particularly towards
Mitch McConnell.

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:42.100
I think he just saw him
as a failure.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.500
&gt;&gt; "Can you believe
that Mitch McConnell,

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.130
who has screamed
Repeal &amp; Replace

01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:47.700
for seven years,
couldn't get it done."

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.030
(tweets)

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:50.870
&gt;&gt; Trump is using the most
powerful weapon he has,

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.470
which is Twitter,
to humiliate him repeatedly,

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:55.170
to rake him over the coals.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.870
To let his followers know,

01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:58.630
"This is Mitch McConnell's
fault.

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:00.600
He's failed you, not me."

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.670
&gt;&gt; "Mitch, get back to work and
put Repeal &amp; Replace,

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:06.930
Tax Reform &amp; Cuts and a great
Infrastructure Bill

01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:09.670
on my desk for signing."
(tweets)

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.030
&gt;&gt; He's feeding it.

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:13.170
Trump is feeding hostility
towards Congress.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:16.900
And that tweet storm galvanized
Trump voters

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.900
to turn against Congress in a
way that I've never seen

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:23.400
a governing party's supporters
engage in.

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:32.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He had exploited
division,

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:35.600
separated the country
into us versus them,

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.300
and now he would target
a new enemy:

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.800
the government itself, tapping
into conspiratorial fears

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.170
he called "the deep state."

01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:49.230
&gt;&gt; There is a permanent class
of federal employees

01:13:49.230 --> 01:13:51.530
that don't necessarily agree or
voted for this president

01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:55.030
and aren't thrilled to see him
in power.

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:58.670
They're working internally
against the president.

01:13:58.670 --> 01:14:00.430
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump's war
with the deep state began

01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:03.500
with FBI director James Comey,
the man

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.970
who had delivered the dossier
and was investigating

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:08.830
Russian election interference.

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:11.930
Unable to get him to back down,
Trump fired him.

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:14.170
&gt;&gt; Breaking news-- James Comey
has been removed

01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:15.700
from heading the FBI.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:16.970
This is a statement...

01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:18.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: TV news helicopters
were waiting

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:21.630
as Comey left the FBI field
office in Los Angeles.

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:24.530
&gt;&gt; This is a very closely kept
secret here at the White House.

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:27.100
I am told only a handful of...

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.000
&gt;&gt; Trump has finally fired FBI
director Comey-- this guy...

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.230
&gt;&gt; When the president
fired Jim Comey,

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.400
there was an explosion,
a huge eruption,

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.530
in the media and the country.

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:37.870
You started hearing Donald Trump
compared to Richard Nixon.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.830
This was another
Saturday Night Massacre.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.130
This was another Watergate.

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:42.830
&gt;&gt; Firing Comey, though, has
drawn comparisons

01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:46.200
to President Richard Nixon's
Saturday Night Massacre...

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.530
&gt;&gt; This is a moment where you
really understand

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:52.700
the feedback loop that Trump
kind of thrives on.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.430
"I make a decision, and then I'm
able to immediately go

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.830
and watch the reaction."

01:14:57.830 --> 01:15:00.130
&gt;&gt; Stunning news, even for
President Trump,

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:03.000
who has been known to shock
people.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.700
&gt;&gt; This is a president using his
power to prevent himself

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.400
falling under the justice system
that we all have to deal with.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.800
&gt;&gt; The bombshell announcement,

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.700
something that was completely
unexpected to anyone...

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.630
&gt;&gt; What are the talking heads
saying about this?

01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:16.800
How is it being framed?

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.200
How is it being covered
by the media?

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.300
(crowd cheering)

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.070
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump would
escalate the conflict.

01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:26.400
&gt;&gt; In a campaign-style rally,
a defiant President Trump...

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Rallying his base
against the media...

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.800
&gt;&gt; Back in his happy place...

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The Justice
Department, and the FBI.

01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:39.270
&gt;&gt; I did you a great favor
when I fired this guy,

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:42.100
I tell you--
I did you a great favor.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.170
(crowd cheering)

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:46.570
Look at what's happened,
look at how these politicians

01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:49.100
have fallen for this junk.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:52.130
Russian collusion,
give me a break!

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:53.870
&gt;&gt; It's basically a kind of
divide-and-conquer

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:56.100
kind of strategy.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.070
And so as long as the country is
sort of divided

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:01.400
and he has his defenders,
he can undermine those

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.270
who are attacking him.

01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:06.600
&gt;&gt; People, take a look at the
intelligence agencies.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.300
Honestly, folks, let me tell
you, let me tell you,

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.130
it's a disgrace.

01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:15.270
We gotta get back down to
business, it's a disgrace...

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:21.070
&gt;&gt; I was surprised, and...

01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:24.730
Unsettled that we have
a new president

01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:29.400
who is attacking institutions
of his own government.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.070
His own intelligence community,

01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:33.700
his own law enforcement
community.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.370
These are people who work
for him,

01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:38.700
and are sworn to uphold the
Constitution

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:41.670
of the United States, so...

01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:49.370
This was an unprecedented,
historic situation.

01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:53.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To his supporters,
he cast himself as a victim.

01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:55.400
&gt;&gt; "This is the single greatest
witch hunt

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.170
of a politician
in American history!"

01:16:57.170 --> 01:16:58.370
(tweets)

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:01.070
"There is no collusion
and no obstruction.

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:03.070
I should be given apology!"
(tweets)

01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:04.670
"You are witnessing the single
greatest witch hunt

01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:06.530
in American political history,

01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:09.070
led by some very bad
and conflicted people!"

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:10.800
(tweets)

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: His tweets provided
the script for Fox News.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.270
&gt;&gt; "Fox and Friends" starts
right now.

01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:19.130
♪ ♪

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:20.330
&gt;&gt; The president is really mad.

01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:21.600
&gt;&gt; He tweeted this out:

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.630
"As the phony Russian Witch Hunt
continues ..."

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:26.500
&gt;&gt; This is a very dangerous
witch hunt.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.000
&gt;&gt; It's only because I think
this is a witch hunt.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.770
&gt;&gt; And put an end to the
political witch hunt

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.030
against President Trump.

01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:34.330
&gt;&gt; If you turn on Fox News,
if you click on Breitbart,

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:38.000
he is this hero victimized
by forces

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.800
who are unfairly attacking him.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.570
&gt;&gt; This is CNN breaking news...

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:43.730
&gt;&gt; If you turn on CNN,

01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:45.770
if you open up
"The New York Times..."

01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:48.670
&gt;&gt; It really looks a lot like
obstruction of justice...

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:51.130
&gt;&gt; Trump is a failing president
who's very unpopular.

01:17:51.130 --> 01:17:53.070
&gt;&gt; ...President has no one to
blame but himself...

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:56.430
&gt;&gt; And increasingly, those two
worlds pulled apart.

01:17:56.430 --> 01:18:00.430
The partisan divide became even
deeper

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:03.000
than it was in the election--
it became a chasm.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.270
And in many ways,
it's an unbridgeable chasm.

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:09.530
&gt;&gt; But he thinks he's still on
"The Celebrity Apprentice."

01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:12.300
It was between James Comey
and Meatloaf

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:16.070
and, well, the Loaf won again.

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:18.100
(laughter, applause)

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.300
&gt;&gt; President Vladimir Putin said
today that Russia had nothing

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.730
to do with the firing
of FBI director James Comey.

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:26.100
(laughter)

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.500
James Comey thought it was
a prank and started laughing.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.230
(laughter)

01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:31.700
But to be fair, that's also how
Trump reacted

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.400
when he won the election...

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.430
(laughter and applause)

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.130
&gt;&gt; (chanting): You will not
replace us!

01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:50.230
You will not replace us!

01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:53.700
You will not
replace us!

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Then, the starkest example

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.930
of just how ugly
it was all becoming.

01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:01.170
&gt;&gt; Charlottesville.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:02.800
In many ways, it was the worst
moment

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.870
of the first year
of his presidency.

01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:09.700
Because it was so--
it was so obvious

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:14.830
what a president should do
in a situation like that.

01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:16.930
&gt;&gt; We have breaking news tonight
with that alt-right

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:19.170
white nationalist rally.

01:19:19.170 --> 01:19:20.630
Take a look at this.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:28.600
&gt;&gt; ...university, the
torch-wielding

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.530
white nationalists coming face
to face...

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:32.600
&gt;&gt; A demonstration by white
nationalists

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.070
at the University of Virginia
in Charlottesville...

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.430
&gt;&gt; What you had in
Charlottesville was

01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:48.670
the alt-right people, many of
them marching in Trump's name.

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.370
&gt;&gt; We could see them marching
with torches,

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:56.970
and it looked like something out
of Nazi Germany.

01:19:56.970 --> 01:20:00.600
(drums pounding,
whistles blowing)

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Neo-Nazis and white
nationalist protesters

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:08.430
were forming, protesting plans
to remove a statue

01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.800
of Robert E. Lee.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.100
&gt;&gt; Hi, how're y'all doin'?

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke

01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:16.830
praised President Trump.

01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:19.800
&gt;&gt; We are determined to take
our country back.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.670
We're going to fulfill the
promises of Donald Trump.

01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:24.170
That's what we believed in,

01:20:24.170 --> 01:20:27.400
that's why we voted
for Donald Trump.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.870
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Also arriving--
counter-protesters,

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:33.170
determined to confront
the white nationalists.

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:34.170
&gt;&gt; This is what they represent.

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:42.330
&gt;&gt; Charlottesville was a clash
between these forces.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.370
(protesters shouting)

01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:46.700
The forces of these
far-right groups

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.170
and then counter-protesters
of them.

01:20:50.170 --> 01:20:52.230
Folks who say, "Why are there
Nazis in our streets?

01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:55.630
We're going to get them out."

01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:59.100
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Armed right-wing
militia arrived.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:03.330
Hour by hour, the tensions grew.

01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:05.770
&gt;&gt; Violent clashes between white
supremacists

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:07.700
and counter-protesters broke out
earlier today ...

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.970
(protesters shouting)

01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:15.800
&gt;&gt; We see, time and time again,
videos of far-right protesters

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.600
beating black attendees
of the counter-protest.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.570
&gt;&gt; Charlottesville under
siege...

01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:24.700
&gt;&gt; As police in riot gear
try to restore calm...

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:27.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And then,
the unthinkable.

01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:29.570
(protesters chanting)

01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:30.600
(crowd screams)

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.870
(people screaming)

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:34.430
&gt;&gt; Holy (bleep)!

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:37.700
Holy (bleep)!

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.570
&gt;&gt; A man drives his vehicle
into the crowd,

01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:43.300
killing Heather Heyer
and wounding others.

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.270
(people yelling)

01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:51.530
This was an incident that was
clearly the tale

01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:55.730
of these far-right, white
supremacist powers

01:21:55.730 --> 01:21:58.330
emboldened and out of control.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:21:59.630
&gt;&gt; Panic and horror in
Charlottesville--

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:01.670
a car slams into a crowd
of counter-protesters

01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:03.770
at a white supremacy protest...

01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:05.330
&gt;&gt; A woman was killed when a man
drove his car into a crowd,

01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:07.270
injuring 19 others...

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:09.100
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump watched
the violence.

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.500
&gt;&gt; Killing a young woman...

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: His response at
this explosive moment

01:22:12.170 --> 01:22:15.570
would be crucial to both sides
of the divide.

01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:18.070
&gt;&gt; When this happens, the
instinct of most presidents

01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:21.000
would be, "Heal, unify, mourn."

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:24.600
But that's not what he wants to
do.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.130
It's not his impulse.

01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:28.770
But, he has to say,
say something.

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:31.430
&gt;&gt; But we're closely following
the terrible events

01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:34.330
unfolding in Charlottesville,
Virginia.

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:37.930
&gt;&gt; He had prepared remarks that
he was going to read, um...

01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:41.170
You know, condemning the
violence in Charlottesville.

01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:44.530
&gt;&gt; We condemn, in the strongest
possible terms,

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:48.000
this egregious display
of hatred, bigotry,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.870
and violence on many sides--
on many sides.

01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:58.030
&gt;&gt; The words "many sides" were
ad-libbed and added by Trump.

01:22:58.030 --> 01:23:01.770
They were not
in his prepared remarks.

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:04.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,
thank you.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The ad lib
immediately provoked an uproar.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.470
&gt;&gt; Struggled to shore up the
president's equivocal response

01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:10.800
to Charlottesville...

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.930
&gt;&gt; That didn't go over very
well, that it was clear

01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:14.730
that one side seemed to,
you know,

01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:16.300
initiate this altercation.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.470
It was the nationalists, these
white nationalists.

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:22.500
They were largely responsible
for the violence.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
Arriving in New York City,

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.630
the president faced a firestorm.

01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:29.070
&gt;&gt; When the president won't
stand with you against Klansmen

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.730
who showed up with guns...

01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:32.800
&gt;&gt; ...he didn't respond
explicitly condemning

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.170
right-wing...

01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:35.700
&gt;&gt; That's how neo-Nazis see
President Trump--

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.570
they are clapping for him.

01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:39.630
&gt;&gt; I think he is making very
clear who and what he is.

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.270
&gt;&gt; Talks like a white
supremacist,

01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:42.670
is likely a white...

01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:44.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Some advisers
wanted Trump to apologize,

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:46.700
but not Steve Bannon.

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.370
&gt;&gt; Not a tough call for most
politicians,

01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:50.130
and so if you can't...

01:23:50.130 --> 01:23:52.800
&gt;&gt; This is where various
elements in the White House,

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.670
in the West Wing, get in his ear

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:56.600
about trying to get him to do
something

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:01.070
that is not in his wheelhouse,
not in the way he rolls.

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:02.430
You can't do that.

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:04.300
Let Trump be Trump.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.800
The nation voted for it.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.900
It is what it is.

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.370
It's just not--
if you try to do it,

01:24:08.370 --> 01:24:12.070
it'll be phony and everybody
can smell the phoniness.

01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:14.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump kept it
going.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.500
&gt;&gt; Excuse me, what about the
alt-left that came charging

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.870
at the, as you say,
the alt-right?

01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:23.330
Do they have any semblance
of guilt?

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:25.100
(reporters clamoring)

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.770
&gt;&gt; He's so fiery, and he's so
angry,

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.370
and he's really getting in
personal back-and-forth

01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:30.370
with members of the press.

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:31.700
&gt;&gt; So, you know,
as far as I'm concerned,

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:35.370
that was a horrible,
horrible day.

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.630
Wait a minute!
I'm not finished!

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:39.200
I'm not finished, fake news.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.330
&gt;&gt; We saw Trump completely
unbound from convention,

01:24:43.330 --> 01:24:48.030
tradition, even democratic
norms, I would say...

01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:52.430
And just fully speaking his mind
in an unfiltered,

01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:56.200
and I think, to a lot of people,
unnerving way.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.870
&gt;&gt; I think there's blame on both
sides.

01:24:57.870 --> 01:24:59.200
And I have no doubt about it,

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.870
and you don't have any doubt
about it, either.

01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:03.570
(reporters clamoring)

01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:07.700
And, and, and if you reported
it accurately, you would say.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.070
&gt;&gt; Excuse me, they didn't put
themselves down as...

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:12.570
And you had some very bad people
in that group.

01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:17.600
You also had people that were
very fine people on both sides.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.300
You had people...

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.930
&gt;&gt; I'm a reporter who has
reported on race

01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:24.930
for a long time, and I never
would have imagined

01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:29.770
the person in the office
of the president

01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:33.370
calling people who go to a Nazi
rally "very fine people."

01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:37.330
&gt;&gt; But you had many people in
that group other than Neo-Nazis

01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:39.670
and white nationalists, okay?

01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:41.000
Thank you all very much.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.400
Thank you.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.030
&gt;&gt; What about the Nazis
who support you?

01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:46.970
&gt;&gt; It's probably the first time

01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:51.070
where the country realizes
this is going to get bad.

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:54.430
And it is the beginning
of a time in America

01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:59.400
where people realize that
America is not just a place

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.800
where racist ideals can exist,

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.370
but it's a place where racist
ideals can be fueled

01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:06.170
by the White House.

01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:09.270
&gt;&gt; Tremendously positive impact
on race...

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:10.630
&gt;&gt; He is about division.

01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:13.030
His presidency is predicated
on that.

01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:15.230
He wants division.
He craves it.

01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:20.330
He enjoys finding seams and...
and driving right into them,

01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:21.870
you know.

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:24.170
There's no fight he doesn't
want to be part of,

01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:26.470
and there are plenty of fights
he'd like to start.

01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:27.500
The fight is the goal.

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:30.700
It's... there's no reward,

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.370
from his point of view,
in unity.

01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:36.630
There's a reward in fighting.

01:26:36.630 --> 01:26:39.470
&gt;&gt; President Trump is being
criticized

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:41.970
by fellow Republicans
for being too...

01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:43.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Some Republicans
broke ranks

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:46.100
and came out against him.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.300
&gt;&gt; "White supremacy, bigotry &amp;
racism

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:51.730
have absolutely no place
in our society &amp; no one--

01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:53.530
especially POTUS--
should ever tolerate it."

01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:54.700
(tweets)

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.430
&gt;&gt; "Mr. President, you can't
allow

01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:59.670
#WhiteSupremacists to share
only part of blame."

01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:00.930
(tweets)

01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:03.270
&gt;&gt; "There's no moral equivalency
between racists

01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:06.470
&amp; Americans standing up
to defy hate &amp; bigotry."

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:07.530
(tweets)

01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:08.900
&gt;&gt; I reacted in a way

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.430
that most of my colleagues did,
as well,

01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:13.630
that this was not where
a president should be.

01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:15.070
This was a lay-up.

01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:17.030
This was easy, you know?

01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:20.800
If there's white supremacy in
any form, you condemn it.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.030
I mean, that's--
that's the easy thing to do.

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:24.970
And he-- and he didn't.

01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:26.570
And I thought, "Oh, man.

01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:30.570
That's really drilling down
on the base."

01:27:30.570 --> 01:27:34.330
&gt;&gt; With that statement,
it sent a signal

01:27:34.330 --> 01:27:37.130
to some of the most intolerant
elements in the country,

01:27:37.130 --> 01:27:43.300
in our country, American
citizens who... are racist.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.730
That he was listening to them,

01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:49.800
that he respected
that point of view.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.500
That he wasn't going to walk
away from them.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:56.170
And, um, and that's,
that's been a lasting message

01:27:56.170 --> 01:27:57.670
that's been out there.

01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:03.270
&gt;&gt; President Trump is holding

01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:05.670
a Make America Great Again
rally in...

01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:08.030
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: President Trump had
been compiling an enemies list.

01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:09.530
&gt;&gt; Campaign-style event
tonight...

01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:14.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The media, the FBI,
and now, Republicans

01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:17.530
who weren't sufficiently loyal.

01:28:17.530 --> 01:28:20.270
&gt;&gt; If you're an elected
Republican,

01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:23.170
Donald Trump has made it clear
that if you go against him,

01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:24.700
he's going to go against you,

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:27.600
and you will pay a price for
that.

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.970
And we saw it in any number of
individual cases,

01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:31.770
and it doesn't take very many
of those.

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:34.200
I mean, all it takes is two or
three of those cases

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:37.000
for people to get the message
that...

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.730
That there is enormous risk if
you go against the president.

01:28:41.730 --> 01:28:44.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One example:
Arizona Republican Senator

01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:48.700
Jeff Flake, who had emerged
as a Trump critic.

01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:51.170
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm thrilled to be back
in Phoenix,

01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.570
in the great state of Arizona.

01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:55.130
(crowd cheers)

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:57.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As always,
Trump would attack,

01:28:57.570 --> 01:29:01.300
rallying his base against Flake.

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.830
&gt;&gt; They all said,
"Please, Mr. President,

01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:07.630
don't mention any names."

01:29:07.630 --> 01:29:09.230
(crowd laughs and boos)

01:29:09.230 --> 01:29:10.930
So I won't.

01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:12.570
I won't!

01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:13.670
(crowd cheering)

01:29:13.670 --> 01:29:15.130
&gt;&gt; It's about going back
to the base,

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:19.470
to demonstrate how popular it is
to be with the president,

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:22.030
particularly in Jeff's
own state.

01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:25.000
&gt;&gt; And nobody wants me to talk
about your senator,

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.370
who's weak on borders,
weak on crime,

01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:30.270
so I won't talk about him.

01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:34.130
(crowd boos)

01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:37.170
No, I will not mention
any names.

01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:38.700
Very presidential, isn't it?

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.100
Very presidential.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.070
&gt;&gt; When the president of the
United States rolls in,

01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:46.670
and you have a rally that has
thousands of people in it,

01:29:46.670 --> 01:29:48.470
Jeff pays attention.

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.170
&gt;&gt; (chanting): Drain the swamp!
Drain the swamp!

01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:51.670
Drain the swamp...

01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:54.000
&gt;&gt; For Donald Trump,
everything's about Donald Trump.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.370
You're either for Donald Trump
or you are against Donald Trump.

01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:01.300
And he wants to-- he wants to
encourage everybody to see it

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:05.330
his way, so he steps in to all
of these and makes his voice

01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:08.230
heard and makes his muscle felt.

01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:10.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was effective.

01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:12.900
Flake's own voters
turned on him.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:16.100
&gt;&gt; I think he knew at that time
that I was out of step

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.870
with a lot of the Republican
base, that--

01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:24.000
that he represented more of
their feelings than I did.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.430
&gt;&gt; We will make America great
again.

01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:31.800
Thank you, Arizona,
God bless you.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.030
Thank you, thank you.

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:38.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Flake understood
what it meant:

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.800
his Senate career was over.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.570
&gt;&gt; The senator from Arizona.

01:30:43.570 --> 01:30:45.600
&gt;&gt; I decided to pull the pin.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.100
None of my colleagues knew it,
at that point.

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.630
But I told a few of them, "You
may want to come to the floor."

01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:54.470
But anger and resentment are not
a governing philosophy.

01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:57.300
The impulse to scapegoat and
belittle threatens to turn us

01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:00.630
into a fearful,
backward-looking people.

01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:02.100
In the case
of the Republican Party,

01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.770
those things also threaten
to turn us

01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:08.930
into a fearful, backward-looking
minority party.

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:12.030
&gt;&gt; I think there was relief
among a lot of, of members

01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:14.770
of the Republican Party that
finally, somebody was coming out

01:31:14.770 --> 01:31:17.570
in the open and saying this,
because on some level,

01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:19.770
this is what most of them felt.

01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:21.470
And they'd been afraid to say
it.

01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:24.070
They'd been afraid because they
were afraid of Donald Trump.

01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:27.470
They'd been afraid because they
were afraid that his base would

01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:29.530
defeat them in the party primary
the next time

01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:31.670
they were up for the election.

01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:33.470
(camera shutters clicking)

01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:35.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As Flake walked off
the floor,

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:39.970
he left the other Republicans
with a choice.

01:31:39.970 --> 01:31:42.300
&gt;&gt; He's basically drawing
a line.

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.830
"If we are going to be a
successful conservative party,

01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:49.300
we have got to turn away
from what Donald Trump is doing

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:52.070
to us, and the way
he is leading us."

01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:54.300
It's kind of a moment of truth
for the Republican Party.

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.330
What kind of a party is this
going to be?

01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:59.030
Who's going to lead this party?

01:31:59.030 --> 01:32:00.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But Flake soon
discovered

01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:03.170
there would be no Republican
insurrection.

01:32:03.170 --> 01:32:05.970
&gt;&gt; There isn't a rush to stick
up for Jeff Flake

01:32:05.970 --> 01:32:07.830
or side with him.

01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:09.800
Everyone just kind of stays on
the sidelines

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.500
and wants to stay out of it.

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.970
A lot of-- when you would talk
to someone,

01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:14.330
"What did you think
about Jeff Flake?"

01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:15.730
"Oh, I didn't see what he said,"
you know?

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:18.170
"I missed it,
I was in a meeting."

01:32:18.170 --> 01:32:19.470
Like, there wasn't...

01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:22.770
much ruminating on his decision.

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:26.270
&gt;&gt; We have a guts and courage
crisis in American politics.

01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:30.730
We have politicians who go to
great effort to get elected

01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:33.430
to go to Washington,
not to fight

01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:35.770
for great principles or causes,

01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:39.770
but to see who can be the best
bootlicker.

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:43.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
The president had won.

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.670
&gt;&gt; Jeff Flake thought he was
going to raise his profile

01:32:46.670 --> 01:32:49.470
to the point where he would have
an opportunity

01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:51.630
to be something bigger
than what he is.

01:32:51.630 --> 01:32:53.800
And what happened?
He made a terrible calculation.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.830
He went against Donald Trump,
who's a proven winner,

01:32:56.830 --> 01:33:00.330
and now Jeff is a guy who also
used to be a U.S. senator.

01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:02.370
&gt;&gt; Breaking news-- two more
G.O.P. congressmen announcing

01:33:02.370 --> 01:33:05.070
that they will not seek
reelection in the 2018...

01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:06.500
&gt;&gt; ...President Trump from two
Republican senators

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:07.870
calling it quits...

01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:09.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In time, more than
40 other Republicans

01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:10.670
would leave.

01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:12.400
&gt;&gt; Of more than a dozen
Republicans who...

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.800
&gt;&gt; In the Trump era, there's no
room for disagreement.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:21.000
The era where the senators,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.170
the members of Congress asserted
their prerogatives, their power,

01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:26.900
would stand up to a president,

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:29.970
seems largely to be over
in the United States today.

01:33:32.230 --> 01:33:33.770
&gt;&gt; It looks like President Trump
is going to get

01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:35.170
his Christmas wish.

01:33:35.170 --> 01:33:37.270
&gt;&gt; The most sweeping rewrite of
our tax code...

01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:38.930
&gt;&gt; The first legislative win...

01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:40.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump's dominance
would culminate

01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:42.630
in front of the cameras
in the Rose Garden.

01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:45.100
&gt;&gt; The most sweeping tax
overhaul in three decades.

01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:46.530
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was a ceremony
for the passage

01:33:46.530 --> 01:33:49.970
of his first major piece
of legislation-- a tax cut.

01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:51.700
&gt;&gt; A major victory
for President Donald Trump...

01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.200
&gt;&gt; It's really...

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.270
I guess it's very simple.

01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:57.600
When you think-- you haven't
heard this expression--

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.670
but we are making America great
again.

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:04.400
You haven't heard that,
have you?

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One by one,
congressional leaders--

01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:09.170
some he'd previously
ridiculed...

01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:11.100
&gt;&gt; Mitch, how about
you start it?

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:15.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Came forward to
praise President Trump.

01:34:15.170 --> 01:34:17.370
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:19.030
Well, let me just say,
Mr. President,

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:21.100
you made the case
for the tax bill,

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.330
but this has been a year of
extraordinary accomplishment

01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:26.200
for the Trump administration.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.600
We've cemented the Supreme Court

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.900
right of center
for a generation.

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:33.030
You've ended the overregulation
of the American economy.

01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:37.670
Thank you, Mr. President,
for all you're doing.

01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:40.570
&gt;&gt; What the Republican
establishment now know is,

01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:41.870
Donald Trump is unequivocally
the leader

01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:43.270
of the Republican Party.

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:44.500
He is the one who sets the tone

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.100
of what takes place in
Washington.

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.670
He is the leader of our country,

01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:52.730
both politically and from
a legislative side of things.

01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:56.630
&gt;&gt; Something this big could not
have not been done

01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:59.870
without exquisite
presidential leadership.

01:34:59.870 --> 01:35:03.630
Mr. President, thank you for
getting us over the finish line.

01:35:03.630 --> 01:35:08.400
Thank you for getting us
where we are, really.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.900
&gt;&gt; Donald Trump has conflated
Republican party loyalty

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.230
with loyalty to himself to an
extreme degree,

01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:17.300
and has been remarkably
successful

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.600
over the last several years
in what amounts

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.070
to really a hostile takeover
of a Republican Party

01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:27.100
that was actually quite united
against him in 2016.

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:30.730
&gt;&gt; Orrin, say a few words,
please.

01:35:30.730 --> 01:35:35.730
&gt;&gt; Mr. President, I have to say
that you're living up to every--

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:38.430
everything I thought you would.

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:43.330
You're one heck of a leader and
we're all benefiting from it.

01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:45.370
And we're going to make this the
greatest presidency

01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:49.870
that we've seen not only in
generations, but maybe ever.

01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:51.500
God bless all of you.

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:56.470
(applause)

01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:59.500
&gt;&gt; Whoa!

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:03.000
Paul Ryan just said,
"How good was that?"

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.400
&gt;&gt; In essence, this became
Trump's Republican Party.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:11.800
The testimony that people gave
there is hard to take back.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:14.070
Orrin Hatch, for example.

01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:16.130
But McConnell and Ryan and
others who gave Trump

01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:19.130
an enormous amount of credit...

01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:21.400
That, that created a unity
within the Republican Party

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.330
that had not existed.

01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:25.330
(applause)

01:36:25.330 --> 01:36:28.530
&gt;&gt; This was a fight for the soul
of the Republican Party,

01:36:28.530 --> 01:36:29.970
and Trump won.

01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:31.500
There's no question about it.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.670
And it's not so much that Trump
took over the Republican Party,

01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:38.130
it's that the Republican Party
completely capitulated to him.

01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:39.600
They're all united in believing
that in order

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.570
to survive politically,
and not lose in a primary,

01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:47.200
they have to stick as close
to him as possible.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.800
Even when he puts out
racist tweets,

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.900
you cannot criticize him
in public.

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.270
Even when he engages
in the most reckless behavior,

01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:56.830
you cannot break with him
in public.

divisive politics

to the presidency, the Congress,

01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:17.130
and it would even extend
to the Supreme Court.

01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:19.330

01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:22.670
that I will nominate

That's six presidential terms.

You know, you might as well put
a D or an R after their names.

01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:12.330
He doesn't see judges
as being independent figures.

01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:13.400
He sees them as just
an extension

01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The network-- Fox.

01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:11.770
&gt;&gt; I did not have sexual
intercourse or anything close

01:40:11.770 --> 01:40:14.130
to sexual intercourse
in high school

01:40:14.130 --> 01:40:17.000
or for many years thereafter.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.370
And the girls from the schools
I went to, and I...

01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:27.300
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The performance,
however, was not vintage Trump.

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:31.170
&gt;&gt; Trump's idea is,
if somebody ever hits you,

01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:33.800
hit them back twice as hard.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.100
And instead, he's got Brett
Kavanaugh talking about

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.030
how long he stayed a virgin
after he was in college.

01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:46.470
And it was-- it was embarrassing
and not especially effective.

01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:47.970
&gt;&gt; Through all these years
that are in question,

01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:50.600
you were a virgin.
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.000
&gt;&gt; And it's through what years
in college,

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.330
since we're probing into your
personal life there?

01:40:54.330 --> 01:40:56.070
&gt;&gt; Many years, many years after.
I'll leave it at that.

01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:57.700
Many years after.

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.570
&gt;&gt; When you look at how all
of this--

01:41:00.570 --> 01:41:02.570
where all this generated from...

01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:04.670
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Kavanaugh decided
to hold back.

01:41:04.670 --> 01:41:08.130
&gt;&gt; Where's this all coming from?

01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:11.070
&gt;&gt; I just want a fair process
where I can be heard.

01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:12.300
&gt;&gt; You don't have
any thoughts on what's,

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.930
where this is coming from?

01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:17.070
&gt;&gt; I just want an opportunity
of fair process

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:20.570
where I can defend my integrity.

01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:24.130
&gt;&gt; You were a virgin.
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:26.200
&gt;&gt; Trump wanted him to get out
there and fight back.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.200
He wanted him to be outraged.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.630
He wanted him to show anger
and, and resolve,

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:35.300
and this was communicated
to Judge Kavanaugh.

01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:37.830
&gt;&gt; To say that everything that
could have gone wrong

01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:39.330
for Brett Kavanaugh has is an...

01:41:39.330 --> 01:41:41.930
&gt;&gt; The impetus
is on Judge Kavanaugh.

01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:44.030
They did not have the votes in
the Senate...

01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:45.770
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: By the time
Kavanaugh testified,

01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:51.800
he had received Trump's message:
launch an us versus them attack.

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.200
&gt;&gt; There was only one person
that mattered.

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.400
It wasn't the committee.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.170
It wasn't the American people.

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.170
It was the president
of the United States

01:41:58.170 --> 01:42:01.730
watching to see whether that
nomination would be pulled.

01:42:01.730 --> 01:42:03.670
President Trump even
noted he was going

01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:06.700
to be watching the testimony.

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.100
&gt;&gt; Your coordinated
and well-funded effort

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:12.930
to destroy my good name
will not drive me out.

01:42:12.930 --> 01:42:14.470
You may defeat me
in the final vote,

01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:17.870
but you'll never get me to quit.

01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:20.100
Never.

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.770
&gt;&gt; He gives a performance
in front

01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:24.200
of the Senate Judiciary
Committee that is basically

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.900
a Donald Trump impression.

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:30.800
&gt;&gt; This confirmation process has
become a national disgrace.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.770
But you have replaced advice and
consent with search and destroy.

01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:36.970
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Right out
of Trump's playbook,

01:42:36.970 --> 01:42:39.070
Kavanaugh made it political.

01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:41.870
&gt;&gt; This whole two-week effort
has been a calculated

01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:44.930
and orchestrated political hit.

01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:49.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Dredging up a name
sure to enflame-- the Clintons.

01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:51.800
&gt;&gt; Revenge on behalf of the
Clintons

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.430
and millions of dollars in money

01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:58.030
from outside left-wing
opposition groups.

01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:01.600
&gt;&gt; It has become this completely
politicized drama.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.230
He turned it into a huge fight

01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:07.070
between Democrats
and Republicans.

01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:10.500
He's trying to rally all the
Republicans to his side.

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:12.870
&gt;&gt; This is a circus.

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:17.300
The consequences will extend
long past my nomination.

01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:21.600
The consequences will be with us
for decades.

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.430
&gt;&gt; The president appreciates
people who stand up

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.730
for themselves and for what they
believe,

01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:29.530
and don't allow the politically
correct police--

01:43:29.530 --> 01:43:32.200
or in this case, accusers--

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.000
stop them or thwart them
or impede them.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.370
And the president would tell you

01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:41.430
he knows a thing or two about
that.

01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:44.730
&gt;&gt; "His testimony was powerful,
honest, and riveting.

01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:47.970
Democrats' search and destroy
strategy is disgraceful."

01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:49.370
(tweets)

01:43:49.370 --> 01:43:52.670
&gt;&gt; We've taken the idea
of judicial independence,

01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:57.530
judicial neutrality,
and we've discredited that

01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:59.470
in the eyes
of the American people.

01:43:59.470 --> 01:44:01.330
What are the American people
supposed to think

01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:05.130
if they watched four days
of reality theater,

01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:08.770
where people are giving speeches
and pounding--

01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:12.870
pounding the table... and
throwing down pieces of paper,

01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:14.830
and saying things like that?

01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:19.770
It's, it's-- it's very damaging
to an institution

01:44:19.770 --> 01:44:22.730
that I have great respect for.

01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:25.030
And I hate to see this happen.

01:44:30.570 --> 01:44:33.970
&gt;&gt; I have to say that I fear
for the future.

01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:35.670
&gt;&gt; #MeToo.

01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:37.270
(audience shouts and cheers)

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:39.730
&gt;&gt; It's never okay to try to
rape somebody,

01:44:39.730 --> 01:44:42.270
not even in high school,

01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:45.600
not even if you're totally going
to be a Supreme Court justice.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.370
&gt;&gt; Many experts think he
has a shot,

01:44:47.370 --> 01:44:51.130
to which Kavanaugh replied, "A
shot? Yeah, I'll take a shot!"

01:44:51.130 --> 01:44:53.200
&gt;&gt; It feels like they're doing
this just to deliver

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.970
a "(bleep) you" to Democrats,
and even more directly,

01:44:55.970 --> 01:45:00.770
a "(bleep) you" to women,
because when this, when this...

01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:02.130
(audience applauds and cheers)

01:45:06.230 --> 01:45:09.230
(siren blaring)

01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:13.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Soon, across the
divide, a gathering storm--

01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:15.230
Democrats roaring back,

01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:18.200
taking over the House of
Representatives,

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:21.300
intensifying the partisanship
in Washington.

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:24.230
&gt;&gt; Quite a dramatic night.
Voters have decided on...

01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:25.870
&gt;&gt; House of Representatives...

01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:28.030
&gt;&gt; Even after Democrats flipped
the House...

01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:31.930
&gt;&gt; House Democrats are already
preparing for battle...

01:45:31.930 --> 01:45:33.600
&gt;&gt; You have a Democratic Party
that is as dominant

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.530
as it's ever been in metro
America,

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:38.970
a Republican Party
that is as dominant

01:45:38.970 --> 01:45:41.900
as it has ever been
in non-metro America.

01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:46.870
And what this produces is two
Americas that are separate

01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:49.900
not only in their partisan
affiliation,

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:52.100
but in pretty much everything.

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:53.470
Trump didn't create this.

01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:55.600
We've been heading in this
direction for years.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.000
But he leaned into it.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.570
And everything he has done has
deepened this trench.

01:46:03.570 --> 01:46:08.600
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Now, a new level
of confrontation.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:12.530
Up close and in full view
of the television cameras.

01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:13.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you very much.

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.170
It's a great honor to have Nancy
Pelosi with us,

01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:17.870
and Chuck Schumer with us.

01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:21.270
And we've...
&gt;&gt; Trump loves an enemy.

01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:24.330
So the advantage of the House
flipping is, now he has one.

01:46:24.330 --> 01:46:26.070
He has somebody to blame other
than Republicans,

01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:28.300
you know,
if things don't get done.

01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.330
Wall not being built?

01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:30.900
That's because of the Democrats.

01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:32.670
You know, immigrants coming over
the border?

01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:34.200
That's because of the Democrats.

01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:38.070
&gt;&gt; 60 people of the Republican
Party have lost their--

01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:39.800
are losing their offices...

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.230
&gt;&gt; He's now got this foil that
he likes to use in public.

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:44.500
&gt;&gt; We gained in the Senate.

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.000
Nancy, we've gained in the
Senate.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.630
Excuse me, did we win the
Senate?

01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:49.130
We won the Senate.

01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:52.030
&gt;&gt; When the president brags that
he won North Dakota and Indiana,

01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:54.370
he's in real trouble.
&gt;&gt; I did.

01:46:54.370 --> 01:46:55.830
&gt;&gt; Let me say this.

01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:57.570
&gt;&gt; We did win North Dakota
and Indiana.

01:46:57.570 --> 01:46:59.300
&gt;&gt; This is the most unfortunate
thing.

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:00.900
We came in here in good faith,

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:04.430
and... and we're entering into
this kind of a discussion

01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:07.430
in the public view.
&gt;&gt; But it's not bad, Nancy.

01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:09.330
&gt;&gt; Let-- let us... no, no...
&gt;&gt; It's called transparency.

01:47:09.330 --> 01:47:10.900
&gt;&gt; I know, but it's not...

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.830
&gt;&gt; He's carrying on, and Pelosi
keeps trying to sort of get it

01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:15.670
to stop, like, "Do we need to do
this in front of the cameras?"

01:47:15.670 --> 01:47:17.170
&gt;&gt; Let's call a halt to this.

01:47:17.170 --> 01:47:19.470
We've come in here in good
faith...

01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:22.030
&gt;&gt; I thought that moment
demonstrated for me

01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:24.130
what he understood
about his presidency

01:47:24.130 --> 01:47:27.100
and the modern presidency
that a lot of Democrats

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.630
and that a lot of Republicans
do not.

01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:30.730
I mean, this is where Trump
understands entertainment.

01:47:30.730 --> 01:47:32.200
He understands television.

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy's in a situation where
it's not easy for her

01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:37.500
to talk right now,
and I understand that.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.900
&gt;&gt; The best moments for him of
his presidency

01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:42.670
are when he is breaking through
the artifice of Washington.

01:47:42.670 --> 01:47:44.230
&gt;&gt; But we have to have border
security.

01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:47.500
&gt;&gt; Mr. President, please don't
characterize the strength

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:49.230
that I bring to this meeting

01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:51.970
as the leader
of the House Democrats,

01:47:51.970 --> 01:47:53.630
who just won a big victory...

01:47:53.630 --> 01:47:56.270
&gt;&gt; To Pelosi or to Schumer,
yelling at each other

01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:58.230
in front of cameras and the
American public

01:47:58.230 --> 01:48:00.670
is seeing you behave
like children...

01:48:00.670 --> 01:48:03.070
That's just... it's humiliating

01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:06.600
and it's beneath the dignity of
the office and their offices.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.570
But to him, that's winning.

01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:10.770
Because that's--
that is showing people,

01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:13.570
"I'm not standing for
this stagecraft here."

01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:15.100
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,
everybody.

01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.870
&gt;&gt; Thanks, guys.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:19.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the months
that followed,

01:48:19.730 --> 01:48:22.930
the political conflict
would escalate.

01:48:25.670 --> 01:48:27.770
&gt;&gt; He pressured Ukraine's
government to assist

01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:29.430
Trump's reelection campaign...

01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:30.830
&gt;&gt; The President pressured
Ukraine's leader

01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:32.500
about eight times,
eight times...

01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.570
&gt;&gt; Today, I'm announcing the

01:48:34.570 --> 01:48:36.200
House of Representatives
moving forward

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.270
with an official
impeachment inquiry.

01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:40.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Democrats,
activated and angry.

01:48:40.930 --> 01:48:42.930
&gt;&gt; The president must be
held accountable.

01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:44.670
No one is above the law.

01:48:44.670 --> 01:48:46.700
&gt;&gt; ...are zeroing in on a
framework

01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:48.370
for their impeachment case
against...

01:48:48.370 --> 01:48:49.770
&gt;&gt; A deeply divided moment
playing out

01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:51.000
in American history
as we come...

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.300
&gt;&gt; What we know is that our
nation has

01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.970
two mobilized movements, that
there remains a fundamental

01:48:56.970 --> 01:49:03.200
fault line in our populace
and in our population.

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.130
We're not going back
to politics as usual.

01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:09.500
&gt;&gt; An impeachment
is the only option.

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.100
&gt;&gt; President Trump continues
to attack top Democrats...

01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:14.230
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump amplifying
"us versus them."

01:49:14.230 --> 01:49:17.700
&gt;&gt; The absolutely crazed
lunatics, the Democrats,

01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:20.270
radical left, and their media
partners

01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:21.630
standing right back there...

01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:23.800
(crowd booing)

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:26.800
Are pushing the deranged
impeachment witch hunt

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.300
for doing nothing wrong.

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:29.770
&gt;&gt; President Trump
is firing back

01:49:29.770 --> 01:49:32.400
and drawing widespread criticism
for likening himself

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.230
to the victim of a lynching.

01:49:34.230 --> 01:49:35.770
&gt;&gt; (chanting): Hey, hey, ho, ho!

01:49:35.770 --> 01:49:37.270
Donald Trump has got to go!

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:40.200
&gt;&gt; Today there's just a lack of
respect and a willingness

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.530
to ascribe the worst motives,
to assume the other side

01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:48.700
is not just the opponent--
political opponent--

01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:50.670
but the enemy.

01:49:50.670 --> 01:49:57.730
The guy who needs to be not
just vanquished, but eliminated.

01:49:59.970 --> 01:50:04.030
&gt;&gt; Our radical Democrat
opponents are driven by hatred,

01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:05.930
prejudice, and rage.

01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:09.930
They want to destroy our country
as we know it.

01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:14.370
Not acceptable,
it's not going to happen.

01:50:14.370 --> 01:50:16.070
&gt;&gt; The damage of this is going
to be long-term,

01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:18.870
and I think it's going to be
very, very deep.

01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:20.230
What have we been willing
to accept

01:50:20.230 --> 01:50:21.930
that we weren't willing
to accept before?

01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:23.830
How do we think about each
other,

01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:25.470
how do we think about being an
American,

01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:28.270
how do we treat one another,
what are our standards?

01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:30.830
And that's-- and I think the
damage is potentially

01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:32.530
going to be very deep.

01:50:32.530 --> 01:50:34.400
&gt;&gt; President Trump sending
a scathing letter

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:35.930
to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,

01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:39.530
demanding she "immediately cease
this impeachment fantasy."

01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:41.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: An historic vote:
impeachment.

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.030
&gt;&gt; Those in favor say "Aye."

01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:45.800
&gt;&gt; (in unison): Aye.

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:47.430
&gt;&gt; Those opposed, "Nay."

01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:49.330
&gt;&gt; (in unison): No!

01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:51.730
&gt;&gt; The ayes have it.

01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:53.800
&gt;&gt; We just saw what is a very
bitterly divided America

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.230
on display, virtually every
Democrat

01:50:56.230 --> 01:50:57.600
voting for impeachment...

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.830
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A standoff.

01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:00.770
&gt;&gt; Every Republican voting
against it...

01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:03.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Feeding the anger,
the outrage...

01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:05.830
the division.

01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:07.330
&gt;&gt; (in unison): Aye.

01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:11.000
&gt;&gt; We were far more divided in
the Civil War.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.130
Far more divided during
the Great Depression.

01:51:16.130 --> 01:51:19.830
But we've always had hope
in the future.

01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:23.930
And that hope...

01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:29.000
We're losing it,
with this division.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.130
&gt;&gt; And all of the debates and
all of the hearings

01:51:31.130 --> 01:51:33.800
hasn't seemed to budge anybody
very much...

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:35.200
&gt;&gt; President Donald Trump is
impeached,

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.670
the vote in the House of
Representatives...

01:51:36.670 --> 01:51:39.470
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR:
And soon, the election.

01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:45.900
&gt;&gt; This country goes into 2020
as divided as it's ever been.

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:50.170
It will go through 2020 with one
of the most divisive campaigns

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:52.400
we've probably ever seen.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:57.230
And it is likely to come out at
the end of 2020 still divided.

01:51:57.230 --> 01:52:00.970
And whether the next president,
whether it's Donald Trump

01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:04.200
for a second term or whoever
is the Democratic nominee,

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:09.100
whether they can move us past
that, I think, is, you know,

01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:12.700
the biggest single question
for the next presidency.

01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.570
And I think based on everything
we've seen,

01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:16.430
not just over the last few
years,

01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:17.870
but over the last decade
or more,

01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:23.300
tells us how enormously
difficult that's going to be.

01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:38.700
&gt;&gt; He was able to say things

01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.230
that no other president
had said.

01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:42.870
&gt;&gt; Nothing was accepted
at face value.

01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:46.970
&gt;&gt; We have a new president
who is attacking institutions

01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:48.370
of his own government.

01:52:48.370 --> 01:52:50.200

elites in this country.
