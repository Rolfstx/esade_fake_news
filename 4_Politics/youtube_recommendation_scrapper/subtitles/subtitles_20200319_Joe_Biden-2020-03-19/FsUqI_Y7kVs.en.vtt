00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:05.133
First Lady Michelle Obama:
Hello, everyone!

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.633
I get to start you all off.

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.800
I want to begin by thanking
General Anderson for that

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.633
introduction, but more
importantly for his leadership

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.266
here at Fort Bragg.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.967
I can't tell you what a
pleasure and an honor it is to

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:22.500
be back here.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.600
I have so many wonderful
memories of this place.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.700
A couple of years ago, I came
here on my very first official

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.734
trip as First Lady.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:38.033
And I spent some -- a great
time with some of the amazing

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:44.133
military spouses, and I visited
again this summer to help to put

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:48.066
on the finishing touches on an
amazing new home for a veteran

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.033
and her family.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.066
So when I heard that I had the
opportunity to come back and to

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.367
be a part of welcoming
you all home,

00:00:56.367 --> 00:01:02.467
to say I was excited
was an understatement.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:06.133
And I have to tell you that
when I look out at this crowd,

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.133
I am simply overwhelmed.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:14.300
I am overwhelmed and proud,
because I know the level of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.066
strength and commitment that you
all display every single day.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:26.133
Whenever this country calls, you
all are the ones who answer,

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:30.266
no matter the circumstance,
no matter the danger,

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.200
no matter the sacrifice.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.300
And I know that you do
this not just as soldiers,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.734
not just as patriots, but
as fathers and mothers,

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:48.300
as brothers and sisters,
as sons and daughters.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.633
And I know that while your
children and your spouses and

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:56.734
your parents and siblings
might not wear uniforms,

00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.066
they serve right alongside you.

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.800
Audience:
Hooah!

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:13.567
(applause)

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:18.900
First Lady Michelle Obama:
I know that your sacrifice
is their sacrifice, too.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.367
So when I think of all that you
do and all that your families

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:27.867
do, I am so proud
and so grateful.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:31.166
But more importantly,
I'm inspired.

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:35.533
But like so many Americans, I
never feel like I can fully

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:41.633
convey just how thankful I am,
because words just don't seem to

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:42.900
be enough.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.567
And that's why I have
been working so hard,

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:49.800
along with Jill Biden, on
a campaign that we call

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.834
Joining Forces.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:56.533
It's a campaign that we
hope goes beyond words.

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:59.834
It's a campaign that
is about action.

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:05.333
It's about rallying all
Americans to give you the honor,

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:10.567
the appreciation and the support
that you have all earned.

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:14.500
And I don't have to tell
you that this hasn't been a

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.066
difficult campaign.

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:20.433
We haven't had to do much
convincing because American have

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:24.433
been lining up to show their
appreciation for you and your

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:28.467
families in very concrete
and meaningful ways.

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:32.100
Businesses are hiring tens
of thousands of veterans and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.066
military spouses.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:38.633
Schools all across the country
and PTAs are reaching out to our

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.934
military children.

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:44.100
And individuals are serving
their neighbors and their

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.400
communities all over this
country in your honor.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.567
So I want you to know that this
nation's support doesn't end as

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.133
this war ends.

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:58.033
Not by a long shot.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:00.700
We're going to
keep on doing this.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.266
We have so much more work to do.

00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:08.200
We're going to keep finding new
ways to serve all of you as well

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.800
as you have served us.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.834
And the man leading the
way is standing right here.

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:23.533
(applause)

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:28.600
He is fighting for you and your
families every single day.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.400
He's helped more than half a
million veterans and military

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.266
family members go to
college through the

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:36.600
Post-9/11 G.I. Bill.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.300
(applause)

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.867
He's taken unprecedented steps
to improve mental health care.

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:47.800
He's cut taxes for businesses
that hire a veteran or a

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.734
wounded warrior.

00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:55.033
And he has kept his promise
to responsibly bring you home

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:56.200
from Iraq.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.734
So please join me in welcoming
someone who's your strongest

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:03.700
advocate, someone who shows his
support for our military not

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.066
only in words, but in deeds,
my husband, our President,

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:11.333
and your Commander-in-Chief,
Barack Obama.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:18.367
(applause)

00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:19.533
The President:
Hello, everybody!

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:23.767
(applause)

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:27.867
Hello, Fort Bragg!

00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:29.133
All the way!

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:32.166
Audience:
Airborne!

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:36.033
The President:
Now, I'm sure you realize
why I don't like following

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:37.166
Michelle Obama.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:39.266
(laughter)

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.900
She's pretty good.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.734
And it is true, I am a little
biased, but let me just say it:

00:05:46.734 --> 00:05:49.367
Michelle, you are a
remarkable First Lady.

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:51.967
(cheering)

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:55.700
You are a great advocate
for military families.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.533
(applause)

00:05:58.533 --> 00:05:59.900
And you're cute.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.400
(laughter)

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.734
I'm just saying -- gentlemen,
that's your goal: to marry up.

00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:13.600
(laughter)

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
Punch above your weight.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.834
Fort Bragg, we're here to mark a
historic moment in the life of

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:25.734
our country and our military.

00:06:25.734 --> 00:06:33.400
For nearly nine years, our
nation has been at war in Iraq.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.233
And you -- the incredible men
and women of Fort Bragg --

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:43.300
have been there every step of
the way, serving with honor,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.467
sacrificing greatly, from the
first waves of the invasion to

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:53.567
some of the last
troops to come home.

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:58.967
So, as your Commander-in-Chief,
and on behalf of a grateful

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:05.200
nation, I'm proud to
finally say these two words,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.500
and I know your families
agree: Welcome home!

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.734
(applause)

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:13.533
Welcome home.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.967
Welcome home.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:20.200
(applause)

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.700
Welcome home.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.567
It is great to be
here at Fort Bragg --

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:31.367
home of the Airborne and
Special Operations Forces.

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:34.467
I want to thank General Anderson
and all your outstanding leaders

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:37.900
for welcoming us here today,
including General Dave

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.767
Rodriguez, General
John Mulholland.

00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:45.867
And I want to give a shout-out
to your outstanding senior

00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:50.633
enlisted leaders, including
Command Sergeant Major Roger

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:56.800
Howard, Darrin Bohn, Parry Baer.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.800
And give a big round of applause
to the Ground Forces Band.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:11.100
(applause)

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.467
We've got a lot of folks
in the house today.

00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:16.100
We've got the 18th Airborne
Corps -- the Sky Dragons.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.967
(applause)

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:21.967
We've got the legendary,
All-American 82nd

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:23.100
Airborne Division.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.567
(applause)

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:32.367
We've got America's
quiet professionals --

00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:34.433
our Special Operations Forces.

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:39.200
(applause)

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.100
From Pope Field,
we've got Air Force.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.300
(applause)

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.533
And I do believe we've got some
Navy and Marine Corps here, too.

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:48.633
Audience Member:
Yes!

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:57.066
(laughter)

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:59.667
The President:
And though they're not
here with us today,

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:03.734
we send our thoughts and
prayers to General Helmick,

00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:07.500
Sergeant Major Rice and all the
folks from the 18th Airborne and

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.934
Bragg who are bringing our
troops back from Iraq.

00:09:11.934 --> 00:09:20.800
(applause)

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.700
We honor everyone from the 82nd
Airborne and Bragg serving and

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.000
succeeding in Afghanistan, and
General Votel and those serving

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.367
around the world.

00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:35.600
And let me just say, one of the
most humbling moments I've had

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.000
as President was when I
presented our nation's highest

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
military decoration,
the Medal of Honor,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.266
to the parents of one of those
patriots from Fort Bragg who

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:54.266
gave his life in Afghanistan
-- Staff Sergeant Robert Miller.

00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:59.867
I want to salute Ginny
Rodriguez, Miriam Mulholland,

00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:05.667
Linda Anderson, Melissa Helmick,
Michelle Votel and all the

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:08.100
inspiring military
families here today.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.633
We honor your service as well.

00:10:09.633 --> 00:10:20.834
(applause)

00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:23.600
And finally, I want to
acknowledge your neighbors and

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.300
friends who help keep your --
this outstanding operation

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.600
going, all who help to
keep you Army Strong,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.834
and that includes
Representatives Mike McIntyre,

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:41.767
and Dave Price, and Heath
Shuler, and Governor Bev Perdue.

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.834
I know Bev is so proud to
have done so much for our

00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:45.834
military families.

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:47.467
So give them a big
round of applause.

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:57.900
(applause)

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.500
Today, I've come to speak to
you about the end of the war

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.500
in Iraq.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.700
Over the last few months, the
final work of leaving Iraq

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.200
has been done.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.967
Dozens of bases with American
names that housed thousands of

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:20.033
American troops have been
closed down or turned over to

00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:22.700
the Iraqis.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.633
Thousands of tons of
equipment have been packed up

00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:26.633
and shipped out.

00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:34.400
Tomorrow, the colors of
United States Forces-Iraq --

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.200
the colors you fought under --
will be formally cased in a

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.800
ceremony in Baghdad.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:50.433
Then they'll begin their journey
across an ocean, back home.

00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:56.300
Over the last three years,
nearly 150,000 U.S. troops have

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300
left Iraq.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.867
And over the next few days, a
small group of American soldiers

00:12:01.867 --> 00:12:07.266
will begin the final
march out of that country.

00:12:07.266 --> 00:12:12.500
Some of them are on their
way back to Fort Bragg.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.767
As General Helmick said, "They
know that the last tactical road

00:12:17.767 --> 00:12:21.367
march out of Iraq
will be a symbol,

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:25.734
and they're going to
be a part of history."

00:12:25.734 --> 00:12:30.100
As your Commander-in-Chief, I
can tell you that it will indeed

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.600
be a part of history.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.266
Those last American troops will
move south on desert sands,

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:40.767
and then they will cross the
border out of Iraq with their

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:42.133
heads held high.

00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:48.166
One of the most extraordinary
chapters in the history of the

00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:52.166
American military
will come to an end.

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:57.300
Iraq's future will be in
the hands of its people.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.667
America's war in
Iraq will be over.

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:03.567
Audience:
Hooah!

00:13:03.567 --> 00:13:06.367
The President:
Now, we knew this
day would come.

00:13:06.367 --> 00:13:09.934
We've known it for some time.

00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:16.300
But still, there is something
profound about the end of a war

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.033
that has lasted so long.

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:24.133
Now, nine years ago, American
troops were preparing to deploy

00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:27.500
to the Persian Gulf and the
possibility that they would be

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.266
sent to war.

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:34.567
Many of you were
in grade school.

00:13:34.567 --> 00:13:38.266
I was a state senator.

00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:41.934
Many of the leaders
now governing Iraq --

00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:45.667
including the Prime Minister
-- were living in exile.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:51.166
And since then, our efforts
in Iraq have taken many

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:55.800
twists and turns.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.133
It was a source of great
controversy here at home,

00:13:59.133 --> 00:14:03.633
with patriots on both
sides of the debate.

00:14:03.633 --> 00:14:09.166
But there was one constant
-- there was one constant:

00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:16.633
your patriotism, your commitment
to fulfill your mission,

00:14:16.633 --> 00:14:19.934
your abiding commitment
to one another.

00:14:19.934 --> 00:14:22.200
That was constant.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.500
That did not change.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.934
That did not waiver.

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:32.500
It's harder to end a
war than begin one.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.567
Indeed, everything that American
troops have done in Iraq --

00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:38.633
all the fighting
and all the dying,

00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:41.667
the bleeding and the building,
and the training and the

00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:50.367
partnering -- all of it has
led to this moment of success.

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:54.233
Now, Iraq is not
a perfect place.

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:55.600
It has many challenges ahead.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.800
But we're leaving
behind a sovereign,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.834
stable and self-reliant Iraq,
with a representative government

00:15:04.834 --> 00:15:09.166
that was elected by its people.

00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:13.266
We're building a new partnership
between our nations.

00:15:13.266 --> 00:15:16.433
And we are ending a war
not with a final battle,

00:15:16.433 --> 00:15:19.333
but with a final
march toward home.

00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:23.633
This is an extraordinary
achievement,

00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:27.367
nearly nine years in the making.

00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:30.433
And today, we remember
everything that you did to make

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:31.433
it possible.

00:15:31.433 --> 00:15:37.734
We remember the early days --
the American units that streaked

00:15:37.734 --> 00:15:41.266
across the sands
and skies of Iraq;

00:15:41.266 --> 00:15:46.200
the battles from
Karbala to Baghdad,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.734
American troops breaking the
back of a brutal dictator in

00:15:49.734 --> 00:15:52.667
less than a month.

00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:55.033
We remember the grind
of the insurgency --

00:15:55.033 --> 00:16:01.100
the roadside bombs, the sniper
fire, the suicide attacks.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.867
From the "triangle of death"
to the fight for Ramadi;

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:08.900
from Mosul in the north
to Basra in the south --

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.633
your will proved stronger than
the terror of those who tried

00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:17.533
to break it.

00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:21.767
We remember the specter
of sectarian violence --

00:16:21.767 --> 00:16:25.233
al Qaeda's attacks on
mosques and pilgrims,

00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:28.133
militias that carried out
campaigns of intimidation and

00:16:28.133 --> 00:16:30.934
campaigns of assassination.

00:16:30.934 --> 00:16:34.800
And in the face of
ancient divisions,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.467
you stood firm to help those
Iraqis who put their faith in

00:16:39.467 --> 00:16:42.834
the future.

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:46.834
We remember the surge and we
remember the Awakening --

00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:50.367
when the abyss of chaos
turned toward the promise

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:53.500
of reconciliation.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.834
By battling and building
block by block in Baghdad,

00:16:58.834 --> 00:17:01.967
by bringing tribes into the fold
and partnering with the Iraqi

00:17:01.967 --> 00:17:09.266
army and police, you helped
turn the tide toward peace.

00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:13.533
And we remember the end of our
combat mission and the emergence

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:18.266
of a new dawn -- the precision
of our efforts against al Qaeda

00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:23.767
in Iraq, the professionalism of
the training of Iraqi security

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:29.934
forces, and the steady
drawdown of our forces.

00:17:29.934 --> 00:17:34.333
In handing over
responsibility to the Iraqis,

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:37.333
you preserved the gains of the
last four years and made this

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:40.834
day possible.

00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:44.033
Just last month, some of you --
members of the Falcon Brigade --

00:17:44.033 --> 00:17:46.900
Audience:
Hooah!

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.600
The President:
-- turned over the Anbar
Operations Center to the Iraqis

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.133
in the type of ceremony that has
become commonplace over these

00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:56.567
last several months.

00:17:56.567 --> 00:18:00.734
In an area that was once the
heart of the insurgency,

00:18:00.734 --> 00:18:02.667
a combination of
fighting and training,

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:06.200
politics and partnership
brought the promise of peace.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.300
And here's what the local
Iraqi deputy governor said:

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.667
"This is all because of
the U.S. forces' hard work

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:17.533
and sacrifice."

00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:19.400
That's in the words of an Iraqi.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:28.467
Hard work and sacrifice.

00:18:28.467 --> 00:18:35.300
Those words only begin to
describe the costs of this war

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:42.166
and the courage of the men
and women who fought it.

00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:47.700
We know too well the
heavy cost of this war.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.233
More than 1.5 million Americans
have served in Iraq --

00:18:51.233 --> 00:18:56.367
1.5 million.

00:18:56.367 --> 00:19:01.700
Over 30,000 Americans
have been wounded,

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.767
and those are only
the wounds that show.

00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:13.900
Nearly 4,500 Americans made
the ultimate sacrifice --

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:23.700
including 202 fallen heroes
from here at Fort Bragg -- 202.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.467
So today, we pause to say a
prayer for all those families

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:31.066
who have lost their loved ones,
for they are part of our broader

00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:32.066
American family.

00:19:32.066 --> 00:19:37.533
We grieve with them.

00:19:37.533 --> 00:19:40.166
We also know that these numbers
don't tell the full story of the

00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:43.834
Iraq war -- not even close.

00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:46.400
Our civilians have represented
our country with skill

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.767
and bravery.

00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:51.367
Our troops have served
tour after tour of duty,

00:19:51.367 --> 00:19:55.033
with precious little
dwell time in between.

00:19:55.033 --> 00:19:57.367
Our Guard and Reserve
units stepped up with

00:19:57.367 --> 00:20:00.967
unprecedented service.

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:06.900
You've endured dangerous foot
patrols and you've endured the

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:12.033
pain of seeing your
friends and comrades fall.

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:14.834
You've had to be more than
soldiers, sailors, airmen,

00:20:14.834 --> 00:20:19.233
Marines and Coast Guardsmen --
you've also had to be diplomats

00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:26.400
and development workers and
trainers and peacemakers.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.200
Through all this, you have shown
why the United States military

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.767
is the finest fighting force
in the history of the world.

00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:38.033
Audience:
Hooah!

00:20:38.033 --> 00:20:50.834
(applause)

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:54.867
The President:
As Michelle mentioned, we also
know that the burden of war is

00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:58.467
borne by your families.

00:20:58.467 --> 00:21:01.700
In countless base
communities like Bragg,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.867
folks have come together in
the absence of a loved one.

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:09.967
As the Mayor of
Fayetteville put it,

00:21:09.967 --> 00:21:12.500
"War is not a
political word here.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.834
War is where our friends
and neighbors go."

00:21:17.834 --> 00:21:19.734
So there have been
missed birthday parties

00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:22.700
and graduations.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.066
There are bills to pay and jobs
that have to be juggled while

00:21:26.066 --> 00:21:29.100
picking up the kids.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.100
For every soldier
that goes on patrol,

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.867
there are the husbands and the
wives, the mothers, the fathers,

00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:41.533
the sons, the daughters
praying that they come back.

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:47.967
So today, as we mark the end of
the war, let us acknowledge,

00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:51.834
let us give a heartfelt round
of applause for every military

00:21:51.834 --> 00:21:55.600
family that has carried that
load over the last nine years.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.467
You too have the thanks
of a grateful nation.

00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:23.200
(applause)

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.033
Part of ending a war responsibly
is standing by those

00:22:28.033 --> 00:22:31.700
who fought it.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.467
It's not enough to
honor you with words.

00:22:35.467 --> 00:22:38.400
Words are cheap.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.700
We must do it with deeds.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.100
You stood up for America;
America needs to stand

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.333
up for you.

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.900
Audience:
Hooah!

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.333
The President:
That's why, as your
Commander-in Chief,

00:22:52.333 --> 00:22:55.266
I am committed to making sure
that you get the care and the

00:22:55.266 --> 00:23:01.100
benefits and the opportunities
that you've earned.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.500
For those of you who
remain in uniform,

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.834
we will do whatever it takes to
ensure the health of our force

00:23:08.834 --> 00:23:10.100
-- including your families.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.200
We will keep faith with you.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.400
We will help our
wounded warriors heal,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.433
and we will stand by those
who've suffered the unseen

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.433
wounds of war.

00:23:22.433 --> 00:23:26.667
And make no mistake -- as
we go forward as a nation,

00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:29.834
we are going to keep America's
armed forces the strongest

00:23:29.834 --> 00:23:31.800
fighting force the
world has ever seen.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.734
That will not stop.

00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:35.667
Audience:
Hooah!

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:39.266
(applause)

00:23:39.266 --> 00:23:46.867
The President:
That will not stop.

00:23:46.867 --> 00:23:53.100
But our commitment doesn't end
when you take off the uniform.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.800
You're the finest that
our nation has to offer.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.233
And after years of
rebuilding Iraq,

00:23:59.233 --> 00:24:01.166
we want to enlist our
veterans in the work of

00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:04.133
rebuilding America.

00:24:04.133 --> 00:24:06.667
That's why we're committed to
doing everything we can to

00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:10.767
extend more opportunities
to those who have served.

00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:12.867
That includes the
Post-9/11 G.I. Bill,

00:24:12.867 --> 00:24:16.200
so that you and your families
can get the education that

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.800
allows you to live
out your dreams.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.033
That includes a national effort
to put our veterans to work.

00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:26.934
We've worked with Congress
to pass a tax credit so that

00:24:26.934 --> 00:24:29.633
companies have the
incentive to hire vets.

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:32.433
And Michelle has worked with
the private sector to get

00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:36.367
commitments to create 100,000
jobs for those who've served.

00:24:36.367 --> 00:24:38.333
Audience:
Hooah!

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:41.600
The President:
And by the way, we're doing this
not just because it's the right

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.934
thing to do by you -- we're
doing it because it's the right

00:24:44.934 --> 00:24:48.567
thing to do for America.

00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:54.066
Folks like my grandfather came
back from World War II to form

00:24:54.066 --> 00:24:59.166
the backbone of this
country's middle class.

00:24:59.166 --> 00:25:02.333
For our post-9/11 veterans
-- with your skill,

00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:07.100
with your discipline,
with your leadership,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.266
I am confident that the story
of your service to America is

00:25:11.266 --> 00:25:15.433
just beginning.

00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:19.700
But there's something
else that we owe you.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.100
As Americans, we have a
responsibility to learn from

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.100
your service.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:32.533
I'm thinking of an example
-- Lieutenant Alvin Shell,

00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:37.033
who was based here
at Fort Bragg.

00:25:37.033 --> 00:25:41.600
A few years ago, on a supply
route outside Baghdad,

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:49.266
he and his team were engulfed
by flames from an RPG attack.

00:25:49.266 --> 00:25:54.667
Covered with gasoline, he ran
into the fire to help his fellow

00:25:54.667 --> 00:26:02.367
soldiers, and then led them two
miles back to Camp Victory where

00:26:02.367 --> 00:26:09.100
he finally collapsed,
covered with burns.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.934
When they told him he was
a hero, Alvin disagreed.

00:26:13.934 --> 00:26:16.500
"I'm not a hero," he said.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.266
"A hero is a sandwich."

00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:19.700
(laughter)

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.100
"I'm a paratrooper."

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.734
Audience:
Hooah!

00:26:26.734 --> 00:26:30.967
The President:
We could do well to
learn from Alvin.

00:26:30.967 --> 00:26:35.233
This country needs
to learn from you.

00:26:35.233 --> 00:26:38.266
Folks in Washington
need to learn from you.

00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:43.133
Audience:
Hooah!

00:26:43.133 --> 00:26:46.567
The President:
Policymakers and historians
will continue to analyze the

00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:50.867
strategic lessons of Iraq
-- that's important to do.

00:26:50.867 --> 00:26:54.700
Our commanders will incorporate
the hard-won lessons into future

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:59.500
military campaigns --
that's important to do.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.900
But the most important lesson
that we can take from you is not

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.800
about military strategy --
it's a lesson about our

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.700
national character.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.533
For all of the challenges
that our nation faces,

00:27:17.533 --> 00:27:21.934
you remind us that there's
nothing we Americans can't do

00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:23.533
when we stick together.

00:27:23.533 --> 00:27:25.700
Audience:
Hooah!

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.433
The President:
For all the disagreements
that we face,

00:27:29.433 --> 00:27:35.400
you remind us there's something
bigger than our differences,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:42.200
something that makes us one
nation and one people regardless

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:48.533
of color, regardless of creed,
regardless of what part of the

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:53.900
country we come from, regardless
of what backgrounds we

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.367
come out of.

00:27:57.367 --> 00:27:58.700
You remind us we're one nation.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:04.767
And that's why the United States
military is the most respected

00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:07.767
institution in our land
because you never forget that.

00:28:07.767 --> 00:28:11.400
You can't afford to forget it.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.734
If you forget it, somebody dies.

00:28:14.734 --> 00:28:16.934
If you forget it,
a mission fails.

00:28:16.934 --> 00:28:20.200
So you don't forget it.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:27.633
You have each other's backs.

00:28:27.633 --> 00:28:30.900
That's why you, the
9/11 Generation,

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.834
has earned your
place in history.

00:28:35.834 --> 00:28:41.133
Because of you -- because you
sacrificed so much for a people

00:28:41.133 --> 00:28:45.867
that you had never met, Iraqis
have a chance to forge their

00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:49.700
own destiny.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.367
That's part of what makes
us special as Americans.

00:28:52.367 --> 00:28:58.433
Unlike the old empires, we
don't make these sacrifices for

00:28:58.433 --> 00:29:05.033
territory or for resources.

00:29:05.033 --> 00:29:09.600
We do it because it's right.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.667
There can be no fuller
expression of America's support

00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:18.433
for self-determination than our
leaving Iraq to its people.

00:29:18.433 --> 00:29:23.433
That says something
about who we are.

00:29:23.433 --> 00:29:26.033
Because of you, in Afghanistan
we've broken the momentum of

00:29:26.033 --> 00:29:27.934
the Taliban.

00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:31.467
Because of you, we've begun a
transition to the Afghans that

00:29:31.467 --> 00:29:34.333
will allow us to bring our
troops home from there.

00:29:34.333 --> 00:29:38.467
And around the globe,
as we draw down in Iraq,

00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:41.867
we have gone after al Qaeda so
that terrorists who threaten

00:29:41.867 --> 00:29:45.834
America will have no safe haven,
and Osama bin Laden will never

00:29:45.834 --> 00:29:48.033
again walk the
face of this Earth.

00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:50.867
Audience:
Hooah!

00:29:50.867 --> 00:30:02.000
(applause)

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.567
The President:
So here's what I
want you to know,

00:30:03.567 --> 00:30:06.200
and here's what I want all our
men and women in uniform to

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.934
know: Because of you, we are
ending these wars in a way that

00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:17.433
will make America stronger
and the world more secure.

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:20.266
Because of you.

00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:22.000
That success was
never guaranteed.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:31.166
And let us never forget the
source of American leadership:

00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:34.100
our commitment to the values
that are written into our

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:39.500
founding documents, and a unique
willingness among nations to pay

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:47.333
a great price for the progress
of human freedom and dignity.

00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:49.867
This is who we are.

00:30:49.867 --> 00:30:54.900
That's what we do as
Americans, together.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:03.533
The war in Iraq will
soon belong to history.

00:31:03.533 --> 00:31:08.000
Your service
belongs to the ages.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.700
Never forget that you are part
of an unbroken line of heroes

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.367
spanning two centuries -- from
the colonists who overthrew an

00:31:16.367 --> 00:31:21.033
empire, to your grandparents and
parents who faced down fascism

00:31:21.033 --> 00:31:27.700
and communism, to you -- men and
women who fought for the same

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.433
principles in
Fallujah and Kandahar,

00:31:30.433 --> 00:31:37.767
and delivered justice to those
who attacked us on 9/11.

00:31:37.767 --> 00:31:42.767
Looking back on the war
that saved our union,

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.967
a great American,
Oliver Wendell Holmes,

00:31:44.967 --> 00:31:49.600
once paid tribute
to those who served.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:57.700
"In our youth," he said, "our
hearts were touched with fire.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:02.834
It was given to us to learn
at the outset that life is a

00:32:02.834 --> 00:32:08.100
profound and passionate thing."

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:14.300
All of you here today have
lived through the fires of war.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.800
You will be remembered for it.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.667
You will be honored
for it -- always.

00:32:22.667 --> 00:32:27.300
You have done something
profound with your lives.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.767
When this nation went to
war, you signed up to serve.

00:32:31.767 --> 00:32:34.367
When times were tough,
you kept fighting.

00:32:34.367 --> 00:32:37.100
When there was no end in sight,
you found light in the darkness.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:43.100
And years from now, your legacy
will endure in the names of your

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.600
fallen comrades etched on
headstones at Arlington,

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.834
and the quiet memorials
across our country;

00:32:50.834 --> 00:32:52.967
in the whispered words of
admiration as you march in

00:32:52.967 --> 00:32:57.934
parades, and in the freedom
of our children and

00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:59.934
our grandchildren.

00:32:59.934 --> 00:33:04.967
And in the quiet of night, you
will recall that your heart was

00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:08.834
once touched by fire.

00:33:08.834 --> 00:33:12.767
You will know that you answered
when your country called;

00:33:12.767 --> 00:33:16.700
you served a cause
greater than yourselves;

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:22.367
you helped forge a just and
lasting peace with Iraq,

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:26.133
and among all nations.

00:33:26.133 --> 00:33:30.066
I could not be prouder of
you, and America could not be

00:33:30.066 --> 00:33:31.967
prouder of you.

00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:34.767
God bless you all, God
bless your families,

00:33:34.767 --> 00:33:37.400
and God bless the United
States of America.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.000
(applause)
