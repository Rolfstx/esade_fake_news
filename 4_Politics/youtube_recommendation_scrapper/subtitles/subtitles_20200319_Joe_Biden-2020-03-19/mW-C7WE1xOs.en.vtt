00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.870
There are many debates in life
that don’t really have answers.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.205
Could LeBron have beaten
Michael Jordan?

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.175
Could Mike Tyson have beaten
Muhammad Ali?

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.544
Could Bert beat Ernie?

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.079
I know they’re friends,

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.780
but there’s real anger there,
folks.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.016
And, of course, one
of the biggest questions of all:

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.286
could Donald Trump
have beaten Obama in a race?

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.822
Not a footrace. We know
the answer to that question.

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.524
A campaign race.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.559
And we’ll never really know.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.828
But thanks to this year’s
midterm elections,

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.397
we get to see what
a race between the two of them

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.798
might have been like.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.902
Because this weekend,
with just eight days...

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.436
with just eight weeks.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.205
Not eight days. You guys
are like, "Eight days away?

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.373
It’s not eight days away."

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:40.741
Yeah. Because this weekend,

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.943
with just eight weeks
until voting day,

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:44.645
the former president decided

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.446
it was time
to get back in the ring.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.482
Tonight, Trump versus Obama.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.551
The former president
blasting his successor by name

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.488
in a rare and fiery
midterm message.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.290
By the time I left office,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.027
household income
was near its all-time high,

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:02.763
and the uninsured rate
had hit an all-time low,

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:06.333
and wages were rising,
and poverty rates were falling.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.669
I mention all this
just so when you hear

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:12.172
how great the economy’s doing
right now,

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.342
let’s just remember
when this recovery started.

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:17.611
(cheering and applause)

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.547
Oh!

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.184
You guys...

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.019
you guys realize
what this means, right?

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.788
It’s on.

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.324
President Obama
versus President Trump.

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.225
The leader versus the tweeter.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:36.730
Yes We Can versus way too tan.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.833
And you know Donald Trump’s
not gonna stand by

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.402
and let someone take credit
for their own achievements.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.805
No, no, no.
He’s gonna push back,

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.441
and he’s gonna do it with flair.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:51.278
So... I have a list,

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.780
and the list goes on and on.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.384
It’s four pages of things
that the Trump administration

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:59.453
has accomplished
in a short period of time.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.689
Each dot is a thing, okay?

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.560
And some of those things
are very big things.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.028
And then I have
three more pages,

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:09.563
two more pages just like this.

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:12.332
Look. Okay?

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.167
But isn’t this much...

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.069
isn’t this much more exciting

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.473
than listening
to President Obama speak?

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.041
Yeah, I guess.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.776
I guess this is exciting--

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.411
the same way
I’m sure it was exciting

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:27.047
to be on the plane that Sully
landed on the Hudson River.

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:28.782
It was like,
"I think we’re all gonna be die,

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.651
but it’s gonna be a movie!"

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.855
Because seeing Trump and Obama
back-to-back

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:38.025
really shows the contrast
between these two.

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:39.292
Right? They couldn’t
be more different.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.662
It’s like night and day,
like ebony and anarchy.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:43.130
I mean, listen...

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.166
listen to how they each talked
about health care.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.602
Their sabotage
of the Affordable Care Act

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.604
has already cost more
than three million Americans

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:53.273
their health insurance.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:56.410
And if they’re still in power
next fall,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.345
you better believe
they’re coming at it again.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.580
"What happens," I said,
"if the entire world

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.649
"decides to go to California

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.785
"because they get
free health care,

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:07.487
free medical care
and free education?"

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.991
California
has just increased in size

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.560
to 500 million people.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.495
(audience shouting indistinctly)

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:21.401
California has just become
one really large person.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.575
What you talkin’ ’bout, Willis?

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:33.647
I’ve heard a lot of criticisms
about Obamacare,

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.382
but I can safely say
I’ve never heard

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.517
that it’s gonna morph a state

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.120
into a very giant person.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.722
-Like...
-(cheering and applause)

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.325
like, what does that even mean?

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.862
And... and while,

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:51.465
while most people
would prefer a president

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.934
who’s articulate
and has a command of the issues,

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:56.136
there are times
when you have to admit

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:59.473
it’s definitely more fun
to watch Trump.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:02.809
Each time we painstakingly pull
ourselves closer

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.479
to our founding ideals,

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.747
that all of us
are created equal,

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.684
the status quo pushes back.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.822
Sometimes the backlash
comes from people

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.290
who are genuinely,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.292
if wrongly, fearful of change.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:20.961
He said, uh,

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:24.231
"What’d you think
of President Obama’s speech?"

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:26.733
And I said,
"I-I’m sorry. I watched it,

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.735
but I fell asleep."

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.737
(laughter, whooping)

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.473
I found he’s very good,

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.977
very good for sleeping.

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:40.046
I-I hate to say it,
but Donald Trump is right.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.516
Obama is great for sleeping.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.317
Because when he was president,

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.787
we all slept so good.

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:49.256
-So good.
-(cheering and applause)

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.595
But now,
now that Trump’s in charge,

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:58.198
we all lie in bed awake
every night trying to figure out

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:01.601
how the (bleep) California
turned into a giant man.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.403
Does he get one vote
in the Senate?

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:04.804
All the people inside of him,

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.072
did they leave
before it happened?

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:08.909
So many questions!
I can’t sleep!

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.311
And, now, look,
Trump may have beaten Obama

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.114
on the entertainment part,
but when both men commented

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.650
on last week’s secret house--
White House op-ed

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.451
in The New York Times, 
it is safe to say

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.588
that Obama beat Trump
on the English part.

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:24.524
There are people
inside the White House

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:27.527
who secretly aren’t following
the president’s orders.

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.062
(laughter, applause)

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.730
That is not a check.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.066
They’re not doing us a service

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:36.870
by actively promoting 90%
of the crazy stuff

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.806
that’s coming out of this
White House and then saying,

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:42.342
"Don’t worry, we’re preventing
the other ten percent."

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.178
The latest act of resistance

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:49.115
is the op-ed published
in the failing New York Times

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:52.152
by an anomish,

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.321
really, an anomynish,

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:57.157
gutless coward.

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.426
(laughter)

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.827
(whooping)

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:03.163
Yo. Yo.

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:07.100
I can honestly listen
to Trump try to say "anomynish"

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.769
for the rest of my life.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.972
It sounds look
a dope new Migos track.

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:13.573
Just like...
♪ Monymish ♪

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:15.308
♪ Mamaminin, amonymish ♪

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.844
♪ Amonamymish,
anomamonamymish. ♪

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.046
And, please, please, don’t get
me wrong, don’t get me wrong.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.582
Obama’s not always
in professor mode, right?

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:25.919
When he needs to, he knows
how to hit Trump where it hurts.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.989
We’re supposed to stand up
to discrimination.

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:32.659
And we’re sure as heck
supposed to stand up clearly

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.929
and unequivocally
to Nazi sympathizers.

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:37.864
(cheering and applause)

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.768
How hard can that be,

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:43.837
saying that Nazis are bad?

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.238
(laughter)

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.240
Yeah! Obama’s got a good point.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.043
Just say it, Trump.
Nashis are-- Sorry.

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:54.014
Nashis are-- I guess there’s
fine people on both sides.

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.116
Look, I’ll be honest.
I don’t know

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:58.318
why Obama’s wasting
his intellect on Trump.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:00.453
Like, we’re living
in Trump’s world now, right?

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:02.589
This is not the time
for some well-crafted speech

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.923
that appeals
to our higher nature.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.792
This is time for a roast, Obama.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.460
Obama should just be
on the campaign trail

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.629
dissing Trump every day.
’Cause Trump knows how to deal

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.165
with nerds. But what
he can’t handle is swag.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.034
Yeah. Obama should just be
out there, like,

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:15.969
"Uh, this guy, uh,
can’t even say ’anonymous.’

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.438
"Uh, I remember when presidents
could speak the language

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.706
of the countries
they were from."

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:22.242
(cheering and applause)

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:24.377
He should just roast him!

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.446
(stammers) He should--
he should just be like, be like,

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.582
"Uh, Trump-Trump’s presidency,
uh, such a disaster,

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:34.054
"it makes me glad I still have
my Kenyan citizenship.

00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:35.588
"Uh, and, uh,

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.524
"and did you folks,
uh, read the op-ed?

00:07:37.524 --> 00:07:38.858
"Uh, nobody respects this guy.

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.593
"Uh, I bet they don’t
even take his orders

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.128
"at the McDonald’s
drive-through.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.397
"Uh, he says, ’Uh, I’ll have
the Chicken McNuggets.’

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.733
They say, ’Bitch,
you’re getting the salad.’"
