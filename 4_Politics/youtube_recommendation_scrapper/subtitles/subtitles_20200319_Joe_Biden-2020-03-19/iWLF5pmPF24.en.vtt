00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.509
JIM GILMORE - Let’s start with Vladimir
Putin.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:10.510
You’ve said in the past that he was kind
of a throwback in a way, his vision of Russia

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.059
as a great power and such.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.449
Give us a taste.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.299
You followed him for a long, long time.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.730
Give us a taste of who Vladimir Putin is,
what motivates him and what his vision is.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.910
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, I think Putin is a throwback.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.950
At least, my assessment of him is he’s a
throwback to the czar era, not so much the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.369
communist era.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.239
He does have this vision, which he's internalized,
of a great Russia and the very expansive definition

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.979
of who’s a Russian—anyone who speaks Russian
is, by definition, according to him, a citizen

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:59.929
of Russia—and his KGB background, which
for him, instinctively, inherently makes him

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:07.790
highly suspicious of the West, and most specifically
the United States, whom he holds responsible

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.450
for virtually all ills that have befallen
the Soviet Union and then Russia.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.630
In fact, he characterized the demise of the
Soviet Union, the fall of the [Berlin] Wall,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.260
as the greatest geopolitical disaster of the
20th century.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.160
So I think that’s what motivates him…

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.990
JIM GILMORE - … How has that affected how
our government, different administrations,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.450
have had to deal with him?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420
Have we been savvy to that?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.070
Have we learned along the way?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.870
Does each administration have to relearn the
same lessons?

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.560
JAMES CLAPPER - To a certain extent, I think
each administration has had to learn the lesson

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.620
over again.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:51.070
Everybody wants to, depending on your phrase,
do a reset, start over; let’s clean slate,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.520
whatever phrase you want to use, to try to
get along with the Russians.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:07.550
And the current administration is no different,
although they seem, to me, to be extra solicitous

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.370
of Russia generally, and Putin specifically,
in ways I don’t exactly understand.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.140
But in one way or another, one form or another,
virtually all administrations, particularly

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.640
since the demise of the Soviet Union, have
attempted to find a new way, turn the page

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.620
with Russia, with pretty much the same results.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.959
JIM GILMORE - And those results are?

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:44.621
JAMES CLAPPER - In the end, given Putin’s
individual suspicions, resentment of the West

00:02:44.621 --> 00:02:53.340
and the United States specifically, where
he is ultimately bent on undermining us and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.630
our system, the results for each administration,
as they've try to replow new ground with the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.850
Russians, have been predictable and consistent.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.180
JIM GILMORE - The Obama administration came
in, and they also thought that they could

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.490
get a reset.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.950
They worked at it for a couple years, and
it went downhill pretty quickly, to the point

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:25.330
where 2011or 2012, Hillary Clinton makes this
famous statement about the fact that the parliamentary

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.760
elections were not completely kosher.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.599
Putin takes great offense.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.351
The fact that his population in Russia is
demonstrating against that issue, as well

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:45.400
as the fact that he is coming back into power
in 2012, he blames Clinton.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.410
Just talk a little bit about that period of
time, about the American government’s view

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.770
of what was going on over there, and how Putin,
paranoically in a lot of ways, reacts to us.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.879
JAMES CLAPPER - Putin held the United States
and specifically then-Secretary of State Clinton

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:14.459
responsible for fomenting what he thought,
what he suspected was a color revolution in

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.299
Russia.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.100
[There is] general animus for both Clintons
on Putin’s part.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.740
Very strong animus toward both of them.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.250
In President Clinton’s case, Putin just
felt as though he’d been dissed by President

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.150
Clinton; that, compounded by what he was convinced
in his own mind, was an attempt at a color

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.020
revolution, and to unseat him.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:54.620
He was convinced that the administration,
led by Secretary Clinton, was out for regime

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.070
change.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.530
So that is the source of the animus that we
believe motivated Putin to interfere as much

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.850
as he did, and as aggressively as the Russians
did, because of the strong animus toward her

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.850
personally.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.280
JIM GILMORE - So let’s talk about the elections.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.650
But just before the elections, 2015, it’s
been reported you were raising red flags.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.340
You were seeing things happening, what the
Russians were doing, getting involved, getting

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.230
into systems within government, computer systems
in America.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.590
What were you seeing?

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.740
What were you worried about?

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.520
And what was the reaction of people when you
would raise the red flags?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.440
JAMES CLAPPER - First, understand that there
was a history for this.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:51.389
If you go back to actually the 1960s, there
was evidence of Russians attempting to interfere

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.889
with or influence somehow the outcome of our
elections, not very successfully.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.419
But given the advent of all the technology
now which has had the effect of generating

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:10.070
more tools and techniques for the Russians
to employ, to interfere, so there's a certain

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:19.190
ambient level that we would expect the Russians
to engage in anyway.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.080
In this case, though, as we documented it
in our intelligence community assessment that

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.240
we published on the 6th of January, this was
the most aggressive and most direct and most

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:37.600
assertive campaign that the Russians ever
mounted in the history of our elections to

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.220
interfere and to somehow influence the outcome.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:50.640
What characterized this, what [made] the 2016
campaign so different than the others, were

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.560
the variety and intensity of the techniques
that they employed.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:04.360
Apart from the famous, or infamous, hacking
of the DNC emails and the exquisitely timed

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.580
dumping of them were their use of very skillful,
sophisticated use of social media, social

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:21.050
media trolls, planting fake news, very sophisticated,
slick propaganda campaign mounted by RT [Russia

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.419
Today], which of course is a government propaganda
arm.

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:30.919
So the combination of all these tools that
they use constituted this aggressiveness and

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:37.130
the multidimensional nature of the campaign,
and that’s what distinguished it from any

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.020
other in our history.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:45.169
JIM GILMORE - … When the hacking came on
your radar screen, was that the beginning

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.360
of it, or were you seeing things before that?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.770
JAMES CLAPPER - It was during the summer or
so of 2015 that we began to see these indications,

00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:04.069
and certainly the hacking attempts at the
DNC, which primarily involved the FBI and

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:09.880
the Department of Homeland Security engaging
with the DNC.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:18.009
Other things that began to unfold from then
on through the election, of course, were the

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:25.650
instances of what I would call reconnoitering
by the Russian intelligence services into

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:33.300
state-level databases, primarily voter registration
rolls, in many cases maintained by contractor

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.039
by each of the states.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.260
It was curious, because, in some cases, it
almost seemed like they were deliberately

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.450
being noisy, if I can use that term, air-quotes,
almost as though they wanted to telegraph

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.300
what they were doing.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.810
And the other thing was, they didn’t appear
to extract or manipulate data.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:09:01.130
It was just as though as they were reconnoitering,
exploring—I surmise, but we don’t know—for

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.350
future reference.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:10.480
In fact, it may have been that they intended
to attempt to interfere more directly at least

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.020
at the state level in the election process.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.430
[Then-Director of the CIA] John Brennan suggested
that, because of the actions we took, and

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.500
the dialogue that the president had with Putin,
and the dialogue that he [Brennan] had with

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.620
his counterpart, that may have thwarted even
more aggressive actions that the Russians

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.260
were contemplating but didn’t take.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:38.790
I don’t know that, but it’s certainly
a plausible hypothesis.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:50.380
For me, when the light bulb came on, or when
I reacted viscerally, physically, when I understood

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.140
the magnitude of what they were doing, and
that it was in fact directed at the highest

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.870
levels, orchestrated at the highest levels
of the Russian government, meaning Putin himself—I've

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:07.880
seen a lot of bad stuff in my 50-plus years
in intelligence—that really shook me, because

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:14.310
of what this represented as an attempt to
undermine the very pillars of our democracy.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.070
JIM GILMORE - There were two set periods of
time, I guess.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:24.490
There's the hacking period of time, the espionage,
and then there's the first dumping of emails

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:31.709
from the DNC just before the Democratic convention.

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:34.161
What red flags did that set up?

00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:36.300
JAMES CLAPPER - I've been asked that question
a lot.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:42.290
When did the light bulb, what instant, what
day and time precisely, I can't tell you.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.400
It just sort of unfolded to me.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.769
And the first instance—and I don’t remember
the exact date of this—was when I was made

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:56.019
aware of the direction for this coming from
the highest levels of the Russian government.

00:10:56.019 --> 00:11:04.779
Sometime in August or September of 2016 is
when I had an appreciation for the magnitude

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:08.260
and the threat that this posed to our system.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.279
JIM GILMORE - And when the WikiLeaks dump,
the first dump, comes out of DNC material

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:17.980
in July, what's going through your head when
you see that?

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:27.700
JAMES CLAPPER - I can't remember exactly when
the attribution of that was made.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.660
[It was] certainly curious.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.810
Of course attribution is not a trivial thing.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:40.800
And I don’t remember the time gap between
the revelation of that and the revelation

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.990
of who we ascribed it to.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.470
So sometime in that period.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.180
Again, I didn’t memorize the chronology.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:54.390
I should have, since so many people ask me,
you know, a blow-by-blow and day-by-day basis.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.370
Bear in mind, lots of other things are going
on in the world besides this.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.170
JIM GILMORE - … So July, the special taskforce,
intelligence taskforce is happening.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:09.540
By August it’s been written in The [Washington]
Post and such that Brennan sends a CIA letter

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.920
to the White House stipulating that Putin
ordered the cybercampaign to disrupt the election

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.920
very specifically.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.089
That’s what we know at this point.

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:23.260
This is when the White House first really
jumps onboard to a large extent?

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:29.760
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, actually, the letter
was a formal notification.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:38.839
We had any number of meetings that, a small
group involved in discussing this.

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:45.760
And again, I don’t remember the exact sequence
or the relationship of the timing between

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:52.620
the letter or whatever notification that John
[Brennan] used.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:59.050
Almost coincidental with it were a series
of Principals Committee and NSC meetings involving

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:04.940
the president himself that took place late
summer and into the fall of ’16.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:13.740
JIM GILMORE - But basically, by the summertime,
by August, this was all hands on deck, basically.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:19.740
JAMES CLAPPER - I think we pretty much had
the broad outlines of what was occurring.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:27.760
Of course, as things unfolded, as we acquired
more information from various sources, the

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.950
puzzle pieces kind of came together and crystallized.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.430
JIM GILMORE - So just to go back on a couple
things that you’ve already talked a little

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:40.779
bit about, but to get a little bit more detail,
the evidence that you guys are seeing is that

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:48.180
the Russian government is running a campaign
and social media, as well as at other levels,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.410
aimed at causing havoc.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.709
They're involved in lots of different states.

00:13:55.709 --> 00:14:01.800
We’ve been told that it’s specific, much
more specific than we thought, on certain

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.000
voter groups.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.940
JAMES CLAPPER - I can't speak to that.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.760
Again, that has come out since.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:19.870
At the time, I don’t know that we were at
that level of fidelity of insight in, say,

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:25.520
summer of 2016, that they were focusing on
different voter groups or that sort of thing.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:31.790
What we were focused on is the nature of the
campaign they were mounting and what the objectives

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:38.740
appear to be, first of which was to cast doubt
or cause doubt in the minds of the public

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.020
or the electorate.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:49.560
And then secondly, of course, was this personal
animus Putin had toward Secretary Clinton.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:55.910
As things unfolded—because initially the
Russians, I don’t believe, took Trump seriously

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.360
as a candidate, just like no one else did
either.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.720
But as things transpired, and particularly
when he became the Republican nominee, their

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:12.920
focus kind of changed, I think, toward—even
when the polls indicated that Secretary Clinton

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:21.110
was going to win—they were focused on how
to undermine her potential presidency, and

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:31.060
then, when he became the nominee, what could
they do to favor him, because clearly, they

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:38.740
would prefer him over her, notwithstanding
the animus toward her, just because he was

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.089
known as a businessman, somebody you could
make deals with, and had had some prior dealings

00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:45.450
with the Russians.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:55.760
And the thought was that he would go easy,
for example, on human rights.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.290
All to say, their objectives, I think, evolved
as the campaign unfolded.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:06.660
JIM GILMORE - As the evidence came through
that you knew more and more about the sophistication

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:13.389
of what they were doing, the idea that they
were focusing on certain groups because they

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:18.110
understood that certain states were more important
than other states when it came to the vote,

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.500
how successful were they at that, and how
scary was that?

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:29.000
JAMES CLAPPER - One thing we made very clear
in the intelligence community assessment,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.760
and we certainly made it clear to President-elect
Trump and his team, when we briefed him on

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:44.600
the 6th of January, was that we did not make
an assessment of the impact on the election,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.820
nor could we.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.880
All we did say was there was no impact.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.730
We didn’t see any meddling with voter tallies—not
to say there wasn’t any, just that we didn’t

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.040
see evidence of it.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.640
And we made that quite clear.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.540
The intelligence community doesn’t have
the authority or the capability or the expertise

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:08.929
to gauge what impact this Russian campaign
had on the minds of individual voters.

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:10.909
So it’s hard to say.

00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:11.909
…

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:14.260
JIM GILMORE - Give me your impressions of
this scenario.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:25.679
We've been told that there was an attempt
to get into systems, that the probable or

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:32.330
reasoning behind it was to disrupt the election
in one way or another, maybe not to win it

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:38.389
for Trump, but to certainly cause Clinton
problems after the election, because the evidence

00:17:38.389 --> 00:17:42.389
of the tampering could be used to say that
the election was fraudulent.

00:17:42.389 --> 00:17:48.659
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, again, those are all
plausible scenarios.

00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:56.320
But as I said, what we laid out in the intelligence
community assessment were the evolving objectives

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.029
of this campaign on the part of the Russians.

00:17:58.029 --> 00:18:06.049
The first one was to sow doubt and discord
and discontent in our country about our system,

00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:11.909
in which the Russians, I think, exceeded beyond
their wildest expectations.

00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:17.950
Secondly, very strong animus to Secretary
Clinton.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.269
I don’t think it would have made any difference
who the Republican nominee is.

00:18:21.269 --> 00:18:25.029
That would have been prevalent in any event.

00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:34.510
Then, as things wore on, what could they do
to help Trump, whom they felt would be the

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:39.600
better candidate and would be better for the
long-term interest of Russia?

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.470
So those objectives evolved as they went on.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.869
Whether or not they had more aggressive things
in mind, I really don’t know.

00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:50.700
JIM GILMORE - And the evidence for this?

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:56.179
I mean, Trump supporters will scream and shout
about the fact that, you know, there's no

00:18:56.179 --> 00:18:58.789
evidence; it’s all fake news.

00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:01.450
The evidence for this is what?

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.700
And if you can't say now, when will we find
out?

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:10.220
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, I don’t know when
we can say it, because much of this was based

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.529
on very, very sensitive accesses and techniques.

00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:21.320
Obviously it would be much more intellectually
satisfying to people if we could lay all that

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.210
evidence out, but in doing so, we compromise
capabilities that we've literally invested

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.059
billions of dollars in.

00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:32.909
So I'm not in a position to describe that.

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:38.809
That would be completely inappropriate I don’t
know when we’ll be able to lay it all out.

00:19:38.809 --> 00:19:44.249
I will just say that for me, the evidence
was overwhelming, and that’s why the intelligence

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:50.600
community assessment had such high confidence
levels with the team that we put together.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.869
There are two dozen or so expert analysts
from the three agencies and my office who

00:19:56.869 --> 00:20:04.070
were involved in this, all of whom came with
lots of experience and understanding of Russia,

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.450
and they were unanimous in their view on what
had transpired.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:15.070
Now, when all that will be revealed, I don’t
know, but I hope it’s sometime away, because

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:20.899
we are still depending on those techniques
and accesses for information, for intelligence.

00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:25.759
JIM GILMORE - And this strong evidence to
you proved Putin, the high levels of the Kremlin,

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:34.009
Putin included, were involved, that they were
attempting to change results or manipulate

00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:35.549
the elections.

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:43.529
The issue of getting into the Trump campaign
and the collusion or connections or whatever

00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:46.399
it may be, how far do you go?

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:49.830
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, first of all, yes, absolutely
no doubt about it.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:54.529
And that’s what occasioned the statement
that Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson

00:20:54.529 --> 00:21:02.259
and I issued on the 7th of October, which
unfortunately got overcome by the simultaneous

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:06.860
revelation of the Access Hollywood audiotape.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:13.229
And that, of course, overshadowed what we
intended to be a message to the electorate

00:21:13.229 --> 00:21:17.909
on the 7th of October, a month before the
election.

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:22.440
So you know, again, I [have a] very high confidence
level in that.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.239
JIM GILMORE - A couple things to clean up
about this area.

00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:31.690
The 21 states, or whatever it is, that the
Russians got into their—

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.110
JAMES CLAPPER - Reconnoitered is my term.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.730
JIM GILMORE - Reconnoitered, OK.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.389
Were some of those states some of these swing
states that we talk about, Ohio, Wisconsin,

00:21:39.389 --> 00:21:40.389
Pennsylvania?

00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:43.950
JAMES CLAPPER - I don’t remember the exact
list of those states.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:50.009
Again, an important thing here is, though,
we did not see any evidence of doing anything

00:21:50.009 --> 00:21:51.299
other than exploring.

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:56.159
JIM GILMORE - Did the federal government have
the ability to—and we’ll talk to [then-Secretary

00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:00.149
of Homeland Security] Jeh Johnson about this
tomorrow, about the warning of the states,

00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:03.809
and the states not wanting to allow the federal
government within the systems, because it’s

00:22:03.809 --> 00:22:05.110
states’ rights.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:11.720
But did the federal government have an ability
to, if there was an attack of some sort, to

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.970
be involved, or was the wall there between
states’ rights?

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:27.349
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, there's a—for me,
quite surprising—As Jeh relayed, the reactions

00:22:27.349 --> 00:22:34.169
that he was getting from many state officials,
when he attempted to engage with them, and

00:22:34.169 --> 00:22:42.190
all DHS was attempting to do was to convey
best practices: How can we help you with your

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.419
cybersecurity and to improve it?

00:22:45.419 --> 00:22:51.450
In fact, coincident with our intelligence
community assessment, the DHS and the FBI

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:57.889
co-authored a rather extensive paper on best
practices to be followed, which we distributed

00:22:57.889 --> 00:23:01.739
to all members of Congress and state election
officials.

00:23:01.739 --> 00:23:05.600
And again, it was advisory in nature.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.260
When the proposal came up to add our voting
apparatus as a part of our critical infrastructure,

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:18.179
again, great pushback from many state officials.

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:27.389
You've got to understand the atmosphere here,
and the environment, very difficult to get

00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:35.889
the bipartisan buy-in which the White House
sought, and I think rightfully so, to get

00:23:35.889 --> 00:23:41.789
a bipartisan statement from the Congress and
the White House alerting not only state election

00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:43.960
officials, but the electorate at large.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:52.249
We had great difficulty doing that because
of the politics involved in all this.

00:23:52.249 --> 00:24:04.059
JIM GILMORE - By Oct. 7, which we just talked
a little bit about—before that, the warning

00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:16.850
of the president to Putin in China about “We
understand what you're doing, and cut it out.”

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:17.850
JAMES CLAPPER - And knock it off.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:24.249
JIM GILMORE - Was that specific to their push
to get involved in the state electoral system?

00:24:24.249 --> 00:24:26.850
JAMES CLAPPER - No, I think it was in general.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.570
Again, I don’t remember the exact timing.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.879
I guess I should memorize this chronology.

00:24:30.879 --> 00:24:36.590
I don’t remember the exact timing of that
conversation, but it wasn’t occasioned by

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.729
any one thing.

00:24:37.729 --> 00:24:44.460
I think it was the realization of the multidimensional
nature of what the Russians were doing.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:49.789
JIM GILMORE - So did you guys advise the president
before going there what would be talked about?

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:52.159
JAMES CLAPPER - He was thoroughly briefed
up on this.

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:59.039
And we had been doing PDB [President's Daily
Brief] articles on this throughout, starting

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:06.340
in 2015, about this activity as it unfolded
and as we were able to understand it.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.960
JIM GILMORE - So how would you define what
he told Putin at that meeting?

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.940
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, I wasn’t there.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:18.649
I'm told that he made it pretty clear that
we were onto what they were doing and to stop

00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:19.649
it.

00:25:19.649 --> 00:25:22.979
JIM GILMORE - And by what he was doing, what
did that mean?

00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:26.779
JAMES CLAPPER - By what the Russians were
doing to interfere in our election.

00:25:26.779 --> 00:25:35.700
JIM GILMORE - Now August, Trump is predicting—he’s
out on the [campaign trail], state by state,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:42.019
going to these rallies, and one of the points
that he’s making at this time is that there's

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:47.009
a chance that the election will be rigged,
that the election will be stolen from him.

00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:51.940
How did that make it more complicated for
the White House to deal with the issue?

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.620
JAMES CLAPPER - It made it a lot more complicated.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:26:02.450
I think there was—and we had many hours
of discussion about what to do here.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:08.979
There really isn't a rulebook for this, not
much precedent, again, for the magnitude of

00:26:08.979 --> 00:26:11.820
this interference.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:19.429
One of the debates was, if we do this, are
we amplifying what the Russians were doing

00:26:19.429 --> 00:26:23.529
even more if we make a big thing of it?

00:26:23.529 --> 00:26:32.539
I think, given the charged political atmosphere,
there was concern that the White House, and

00:26:32.539 --> 00:26:37.710
specifically the president, would be seen
as putting his hand on the scale in favor

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.149
of Secretary Clinton over Trump.

00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:46.059
And of course, the rhetoric about the election
being rigged, calling that shot before the

00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:48.580
election, amplified that.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:54.599
JIM GILMORE - So by late September, the way
it’s been reported, the White House had

00:26:54.599 --> 00:27:02.409
decided that retaliation against the Russians
was put off until after the election.

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:11.229
JAMES CLAPPER - I don’t remember if we made
a conscious decision about when to do something.

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:13.320
I can't say that.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:20.529
We had a lot of, obviously, a lot of discussion
about taking the action we ultimately took,

00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:25.259
which was PNG'ing 35 of the top intelligence
operatives of the Russians.

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:26.581
Make no mistake, that’s what they were.

00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:27.889
They were not diplomats.

00:27:27.889 --> 00:27:34.080
And, of course, closing the two dachas and
sanctioning individual people, I don’t know

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.099
that there was a conscious discussion so much
about whether to do it before or after the

00:27:38.099 --> 00:27:44.419
election, but just getting a consensus among
the interagency about what to do.

00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:49.149
JIM GILMORE - But why would it take until
late December to finally make the decision?

00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:55.679
JAMES CLAPPER - I outlined before, in my previous
response, why the White House was reluctant

00:27:55.679 --> 00:28:06.919
to publicly and overtly engage on this, because
of reinforcing what the Russians were doing,

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:12.440
dignifying it, if you will, and the sense
of interfering in the election process or

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.239
trying to influence it, where the commander
in chief was putting his hand on the scale

00:28:17.239 --> 00:28:18.239
in favor of Clinton.

00:28:18.239 --> 00:28:20.659
JIM GILMORE - So by Oct. 7—

00:28:20.659 --> 00:28:27.999
JAMES CLAPPER - I also will add, I think there
was perhaps—and this is implicit, not explicit—faith

00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:34.229
in the electorate, and in the end that the
electorate would do the right thing.

00:28:34.229 --> 00:28:35.609
JIM GILMORE - Meaning?

00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:41.529
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, make the right choice,
unaffected by an outside influence like Russia.

00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:52.659
JIM GILMORE - By Oct. 7, you are all feeling
that it’s necessary to make some statement,

00:28:52.659 --> 00:28:57.370
some public statement, to warn the public.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.589
Was that an agreed-upon decision?

00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:04.879
JAMES CLAPPER - We debated it, and for the
same reasons, there was reluctance on the

00:29:04.879 --> 00:29:05.879
part of some.

00:29:05.879 --> 00:29:07.979
I won't go into who took what position.

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:18.190
But in the end, everyone agreed, if not acquiesced,
I’ll put it that way, in the statement that

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.099
Jeh and I issued jointly on the 7th of October.

00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:33.230
Jeh and I were I think of like mind here,
that if the election for whatever reason and

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:39.830
whatever manner were to go south, and then
afterward it was learned that we knew about

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:43.499
what the Russians were doing, or had some
pretty good insight into what they were doing,

00:29:43.499 --> 00:29:47.269
and we didn’t say anything about it before
the election, there would really be hell to

00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:48.269
pay.

00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:52.809
I think as time went on, and the magnitude
of what they were doing became clearer and

00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:57.240
clearer, people were more comfortable with
that, ergo the statement we made on the 7th

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.240
of October.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.849
JIM GILMORE - When you look back at it now,
do you feel it was too late?

00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:03.769
Do you wish that you’d come out earlier?

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:08.200
JAMES CLAPPER - You can do “could've/would've/should've”
all day long about what we should have or

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.379
might have done.

00:30:10.379 --> 00:30:16.379
I personally feel that what we did was the
right thing given the circumstances at the

00:30:16.379 --> 00:30:23.649
time, and the highly charged environment that
existed in the run-up to the actual election.

00:30:23.649 --> 00:30:29.219
I've done a lot of investigations in my time,
and one thing I found is that, after the fact,

00:30:29.219 --> 00:30:35.200
it's very difficult to go back and completely
recreate the contemporary environment that

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.210
led people to make the decisions they made.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.600
JIM GILMORE - You’ve talked about it already,
so you don’t have to go in that much detail.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.549
But you guys were, needless to say, surprised
at the reaction, surprised at the fact that

00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:53.870
what everybody expected to be front-page news
became below-the-fold news, because of what

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.609
else happened on that day.

00:30:55.609 --> 00:31:07.380
JAMES CLAPPER - I don’t know if I was surprised
as much as disappointed, given the drama,

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.849
the daily drama that went on during the campaign
and has continued.

00:31:10.849 --> 00:31:14.159
I wouldn’t say surprised is the right way
to describe it.

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:16.849
I was disappointed that it didn’t get more
focus.

00:31:16.849 --> 00:31:17.849
…

00:31:17.849 --> 00:31:24.610
JIM GILMORE - The meetings continue in December
to talk about sanctions and what could be

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.610
done.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:26.889
Decisions are made.

00:31:26.889 --> 00:31:33.380
The president then, on the 29th from Hawaii,
makes the announcement.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:39.739
There's a response, a view at this point,
by some people that it was too limited, that

00:31:39.739 --> 00:31:45.009
there wasn’t enough, that even the sanctions
weren’t anything like the sanctions after

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:46.070
Ukraine.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:51.830
What’s sort of your overview about that
process and the end result?

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:58.100
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, I never considered the
steps we took as the end.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:03.659
I think the anticipation was that this was
the first step, and that the next administration

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:07.610
would do more, which didn’t exactly happen
that way.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:10.100
The Congress did it.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.700
But what we did was intended as a first step.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:19.889
In fact, one of the reasons why President
Obama tasked us to do our assessment, and

00:32:19.889 --> 00:32:24.129
to have it out before the end of his term,
was he wanted to be able to hand that over

00:32:24.129 --> 00:32:31.549
to not only the Congress, but to the next
administration, as a basis for further action.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:35.679
JIM GILMORE - The expectation is that Putin
is going to respond in kind.

00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:37.179
It doesn’t happen.

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:38.529
What are you thinking about that?

00:32:38.529 --> 00:32:43.849
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, having watched the Soviets
and the Russians for much of my professional

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:53.889
life, I, as others did, found that strange
that they didn’t retaliate.

00:32:53.889 --> 00:33:01.129
In fact, that’s one of the factors that
bore on the discussion: Well, how many Russian

00:33:01.129 --> 00:33:03.509
operatives should we PNG?

00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:06.389
We could have PNG’d a lot more.

00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:10.999
They had many more than 35 intelligence operatives
in this country.

00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:15.719
The Russians probably have more spies present
in our country than any other country, to

00:33:15.719 --> 00:33:18.359
include China.

00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:23.309
So that was a tempering factor, because we
were figuring that, for every one that we

00:33:23.309 --> 00:33:27.080
PNG’d, there would be a reciprocal action
on the part of the Russians.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.629
JIM GILMORE - So you limited the number?

00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:32.419
JAMES CLAPPER - That had a bearing on how
many people were PNG’d, yes.

00:33:32.419 --> 00:33:35.279
JIM GILMORE - What did you think was the cause
for it?

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.279
JAMES CLAPPER - For what?

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:37.279
JIM GILMORE - For their non-response?

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:38.279
JAMES CLAPPER - I didn’t know.

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:40.279
I thought it was very strange.

00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:44.370
Or whether they just were going to blow it
off and wait until the next administration.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:49.710
I honestly didn’t know, at the time, what
occasioned their non-reaction.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:54.239
JIM GILMORE - And when you heard about the
intelligence that we had about the conversation

00:33:54.239 --> 00:34:00.759
between Michael Flynn, General Flynn, and
[Russian Ambassador Sergey] Kislyak, what

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:01.759
did you take from that?

00:34:01.759 --> 00:34:07.950
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, it seemed to serve as
an explanation for, without going into the

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:13.519
source of the information or how I knew about
it, but it would appear that that would explain

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:16.679
the non-reaction on the part of the Russians.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:22.870
JIM GILMORE - So the whole story of what happens
to Flynn, the fact that Flynn is not honest

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:26.799
with the vice president and such, what's your
take on that whole episode?

00:34:26.799 --> 00:34:31.529
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, I know Mike Flynn.

00:34:31.529 --> 00:34:34.030
We go back many years.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:39.940
I would first salute his long and distinguished
Army career.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.559
He was a great tactical intelligence officer.

00:34:44.559 --> 00:34:50.470
He had certain challenges at DIA [Defense
Intelligence Agency], and that's why we took

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:51.470
the action we took.

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:55.530
It was in the best interests of the agency.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:01.160
I had concerns about whether he had the right
skill set to be a national security adviser,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:07.539
having worked for three of them myself directly
and others indirectly before that.

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:17.730
I just wondered whether he had the right set
of experiences and skill sets to be successful

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:18.730
in that position.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.730
…

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:25.250
JIM GILMORE - This whole question of collusion
and such, the FBI is looking at it in July.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:30.010
But when are you aware that the Trump campaign
and Russians are meeting, that there are concerns

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:35.569
about whether either there's collusion or
people are being used?

00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:43.569
JAMES CLAPPER - We saw evidence of all kinds
of interactions between Trump camp members

00:35:43.569 --> 00:35:44.569
and the Russians.

00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:49.869
Now, that’s not to say we knew necessarily
the content of these discussions.

00:35:49.869 --> 00:35:58.769
We just knew there were a lot of meetings,
certainly weren’t aware of the since-revealed

00:35:58.769 --> 00:36:01.029
meeting in June in Trump Tower.

00:36:01.029 --> 00:36:04.390
We didn’t know that contemporaneously.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:12.530
But that’s what occasioned, as I've said
before, where my dashboard warning lights

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.260
were on just because of that.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:23.039
When you have a valid foreign intelligence
target who is engaging with any American,

00:36:23.039 --> 00:36:30.940
any U.S. person, that raises a yellow flag,
and particularly when it’s an adversary,

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:36.779
operatives of an adversary, Russia, what are
they trying to do?

00:36:36.779 --> 00:36:37.779
Co-opt?

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:38.779
Gain influence?

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:40.369
Gain access?

00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:41.369
What?

00:36:41.369 --> 00:36:46.869
So for that reason, all of us who were aware
of this had concerns.

00:36:46.869 --> 00:36:51.240
JIM GILMORE - Especially because the people
that were being contacted were not what you

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.269
would call savvy intelligence operatives.

00:36:54.269 --> 00:36:56.349
JAMES CLAPPER - That was part of it.

00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:59.839
You know, was there naïveté involved here?

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:00.839
What?

00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:03.300
We just—we weren’t sure.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:11.700
And I, for my part at least, had not seen
any direct evidence of political collusion

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.520
between the campaign and the Russians.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.849
May have been there, but I, for my part, did
not see it.

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:22.460
JIM GILMORE - … The June 6, 2016, meeting,
though, with Don [Trump] Jr. and [Jared] Kushner

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:30.901
and [Paul] Manafort, with a Kremlin-connected
lawyer and another Russian lobbyist, when

00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:36.380
the details about that did come out, what
were the things about that meeting—the willingness

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:42.940
of Donald Trump Jr., when he got the message
that the Russian government was interested

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.950
in helping his father, was interested in providing
information that would be damaging to Hillary

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:51.660
Clinton, and his basic attitude was, “Bring
it on”?

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.440
What red flags went up for you when you saw
that?

00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:02.170
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, not just for me but
for many other intelligence people.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.329
You wonder, what are the Russians doing here?

00:38:06.329 --> 00:38:14.579
Is this a soft approach just to discern, is
there interest in further dialogue?

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:20.330
That’s why I don’t think the Russians
were real careful about trying to mask it.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:26.670
Certainly they could and have claimed plausible
deniability that there was any connection

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:30.589
with the Russian government, which I'm very
skeptical about.

00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:37.750
So all those kind of yellow flags go up when
you see an engagement like this.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:44.099
JIM GILMORE - So if it was sort of a soft
attempt, if hard attempts followed, that’s

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:46.021
when the FSB [Federal Security Service of
the Russian Federation, formerly the KGB]

00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:47.021
folks would be more careful.

00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:51.650
JAMES CLAPPER - I think John Brennan did a
good job of laying that out.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:59.980
What the potential here is, where people are
co-opted, maybe initially unwittingly, they

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.140
don’t know they're being caught up in the
net, so to speak.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.510
And this is typical Soviet Russian tradecraft.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:14.930
JIM GILMORE - The Jan. 6 meeting, where and
Brennan and Comey go up to brief—

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.460
JAMES CLAPPER - And [NSA Director] Adm. Mike
Rogers.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:21.140
JIM GILMORE - And Rogers went up to brief
Trump.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.200
Just describe that.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.820
The way it’s been defined is you guys offered
a pretty compelling case.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:35.080
JAMES CLAPPER - I have to say here that when
I was doing my tussling on the Hill, that

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.000
White House has got executive privilege concerns,
so I have to be a little circumspect about

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
it.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.869
But I will say that the then-president-elect
was affable, courteous even, even complimentary

00:39:48.869 --> 00:39:51.900
of the presentation.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.760
We were there maybe 90 minutes or so.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:01.599
And you know, he paid attention, and he and
his team asked some pretty good questions.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:05.520
There was no pushback.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.930
And I think the reason was that the evidence
that we laid out at the highly classified

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.059
level was pretty compelling.

00:40:11.059 --> 00:40:15.109
It would have been very hard to have pushback.

00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:20.240
So we didn’t hear anything about the 400-pound
guy in his bed in New Jersey during that meeting.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:29.660
JIM GILMORE - But on the Jan. 11 press conference
that Trump gives soon after, he reluctantly

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.299
admits that there was a Russian role.

00:40:33.299 --> 00:40:35.660
But it was reluctant, when you heard him.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.900
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, it was reluctant.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:43.710
Then again, more recently, when he was in
Poland, he cast further doubt about it, saying,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.619
“Yeah, it could have been the Russians;
it could have been others as well.”

00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:52.720
Of course his news conference on Jan. 11,
in which he likened the intelligence community

00:40:52.720 --> 00:41:00.079
to Nazis, which I thought was completely inappropriate,
and that’s what occasioned my calling him

00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:02.210
about that, about that reference.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.801
JIM GILMORE - And you called him up—

00:41:03.801 --> 00:41:07.740
JAMES CLAPPER - I thought I had to do that,
just in the interest of defending the intelligence

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.940
community and then the great men and women
in it.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.349
JIM GILMORE - So what do you say?

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:12.359
And what's his response?

00:41:12.359 --> 00:41:19.920
JAMES CLAPPER - What I tried to do was appeal
to his higher instincts and to impart to him

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:27.089
that we’re not Nazis, and that he’s inheriting
a national treasure in the form of the U.S.

00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:32.220
intelligence community whose institutional
instincts are to serve the president as commander

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:37.589
in chief, and to make the president, as commander
in chief, as successful as possible, and to

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:39.760
keep him as well informed as possible.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.790
And I hope he would consider that.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:49.619
I was actually hopeful that, when I heard
that the first place he was going to visit

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:57.791
after his inauguration was the CIA, and I
thought, well, perhaps we’re going to make

00:41:57.791 --> 00:42:02.380
up with the intelligence community, which
proved not to be the case.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.549
JIM GILMORE - But why?

00:42:03.549 --> 00:42:06.500
I mean, what was the evidence?

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:13.250
JAMES CLAPPER - He was all right for about
two minutes into his remarks and then used

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:19.180
the backdrop of the hallowed wall in the lobby
of the old headquarters building [OHB, Original

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:26.470
Headquarters Building] in CIA, which has now,
I think, 126 stars of CIA officers who paid

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:33.059
the ultimate price for this country, and used
that as sort of a publicity backdrop to rail

00:42:33.059 --> 00:42:37.750
about the size of the crowd in the Mall or
his war with the media.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.509
I just thought [that] was completely inappropriate.

00:42:39.509 --> 00:42:43.450
JIM GILMORE - And it’s been reported that
after this conversation that you had with

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:47.980
him, trying to get him to understand the importance
of the intelligence services, one thing that

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:53.000
he was fixated on, to some extent, was that
you guys had also briefed about the Steele

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.900
dossier when you were up at Trump Tower, [and]
that he wanted you to come out publicly and

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.799
distance him from that dossier.

00:43:01.799 --> 00:43:04.349
What did that say to you?

00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:11.309
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, he did bring that up
when I called him, and [he] wanted me to put

00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:14.300
out a statement rebutting it, which I couldn’t
do.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.390
I couldn’t affirm it or deny it.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:25.380
The point was, in briefing him about it, was
to inform him of its existence.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:31.519
We felt a duty to warn, if you will, just
so that he knew that it was out there.

00:43:31.519 --> 00:43:38.329
A lot of people in the media already had it;
at least two members of Congress had it.

00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:42.849
I learned about it rather belatedly.

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:48.981
It was not long after we began to work on
the intelligence community assessment is when

00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:51.220
I first learned of it.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:54.109
So he did bring that up.

00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:57.039
I couldn’t do that.

00:43:57.039 --> 00:43:59.740
JIM GILMORE - Surprised that he would bring
that up?

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.000
JAMES CLAPPER - No.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.269
JIM GILMORE - Because?

00:44:02.269 --> 00:44:10.420
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, I think it was very
much on his mind, and it’s, without commenting

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.440
one way or the other on its veracity, it’s
not very complimentary.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:20.180
So I think he was quite concerned about this,
you know, the impact on his image.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.630
JIM GILMORE - Looking back at all of this,
at the whole election, and what the Russians

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:28.650
did and why they did it, and going back to
Putin and the man that you know very well,

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.630
what do you think he thinks he achieved here?

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.410
JAMES CLAPPER - Well, he’s got to be pretty
happy.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:41.829
The Russians—he personally, and the Russians
collectively, and his leadership group, because

00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:49.540
in my view, they way exceeded expectations
about particularly their first objective,

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:54.970
which was to sow discord and discontent in
this country.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:56.660
They succeeded imminently.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.539
And that’s still going on.

00:44:58.539 --> 00:45:01.619
And by the way, the Russians aren’t going
to stop.

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:07.940
If anything, their experience in our 2016
election is going to embolden them to interfere

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.319
in the future, maybe more aggressively.

00:45:09.319 --> 00:45:15.329
JIM GILMORE - …Do you see a connection,
a correlation between his views on what happened

00:45:15.329 --> 00:45:17.440
there [in the 2011-2012 demonstrations against
Putin] and then what the Russians did in our

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.440
elections?

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:25.930
JAMES CLAPPER - I think fundamentally there
is an aversion to our whole system, an aversion

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:27.230
to democracy.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:36.589
He doesn’t believe in it and views it as
threatening to him, personally.

00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:39.220
That is what it all boils down to in Russia.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.140
Yeah, he’s the president of Russia.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.119
He’s also Putin, Inc.

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:54.250
He’s made billions, and his oligarchs, by
preserving and profiting from a system that

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.779
he sits atop of.

00:45:57.779 --> 00:46:02.609
I just think that’s almost in his genes,
in the Russian genes, to do what they did,

00:46:02.609 --> 00:46:03.630
and they’ll continue to do it.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:09.150
JIM GILMORE - This is the man that, back in
2000, we had great hope for, after Yeltsin,

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:14.559
that he would follow through and sort of bring
Russia into the fold of Europe and into the

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:16.490
fold of the West.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:17.790
What happened?

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:28.010
JAMES CLAPPER - Whether it’s justified or
not, I think he felt the West, specifically

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:33.900
the U.S., gloated about the fall of, the demise
of the Soviet Union.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:41.410
I think the expansion of NATO he found very,
very threatening and very aggressive.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:51.160
So I think that those were the proximate seeds
of his deep resentment of the West, the Western

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.840
alliance, led by the United States.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:47:00.790
And that’s why they also will continue to
try to drive wedges within Europe and between

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:01.989
Europe and the United States.
