&gt;&gt; Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WE'RE BACK WITH DR. SANJAY

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.005 align:start position:0%
GUPTA.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.808 align:start position:0%
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU MENTIONED
THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.711
EXPOSED TO THIS, YOU MIGHT BE
TESTED AND, YOU KNOW, FIND OUT

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.480
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND
THEN PEOPLE THAT YOU EXPOSED

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:22.722 align:start position:0%
HAVE TO BE QUARANTINED, HOW DO
YOU GET TESTED?

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:23.723 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; UM --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:24.323 align:start position:0%
TESTED?

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.258 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.526 align:start position:0%
I DON'T THINK EVERYONE NEEDS TO
GET TESTED.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.928 align:start position:0%
I THINK DOCTORS NEED TO MAKE
GOOD JUDGMENT HERE.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:33.266
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO CAUSE
PANIC BY SAYING EVERYONE SHOULD

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.434 align:start position:0%
GET TESTED.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.668
THERE ARE 350 MILLION PEOPLE.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE PRESIDENT HAS
SAID, LAST WEEK, THAT THERE ARE

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.907
TESTS OUT THERE FOR EVERYONE,
PRESENTLY TESTS FOR EVERYONE,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.676
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL TESTS, GREAT
TESTS, EVERYONE WHO WANTS A TEST

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:47.947 align:start position:0%
CAN GET ONE TODAY, AS OF
YESTERDAY, HE SAID.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.187 align:start position:0%
IS THAT TRUE OR FALSE, SANJAY
GUPTA?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.654 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S FALSE.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.822 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.724 align:start position:0%
AND IT'S SAD BECAUSE THERE
ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WORK SO

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.726
WELL WITH OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:03.029 align:start position:0%
I'M A MEMBER OF THE HEALTHCARE
SYSTEM.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.664 align:start position:0%
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT
WORK.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.133 align:start position:0%
WE FAIL WITH REGARD TO TESTING
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.836 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHY, THOUGH?

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.440 size:88% position:44%
WE DO HAVE EXCELLENT MEDICAL
PROFESSIONALS AND FANTASTIC

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:17.210
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY IN THE UNITED
STATES, WHY DON'T WE HAVE A TEST

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.147 align:start position:0%
AND WHY DID WE REFUSE THE GERMAN
TEST?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.815
&gt;&gt; WELL, WITH REGARD TO THAT
SECOND QUESTION, I THINK THAT'S

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.984 size:84% position:42%
A REALLY INTERESTING THING.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.653
WE GET VERY PROVINCIAL IN THE
UNITED STATES, IF IT'S NOT

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:31.224
STAMPED WITH A MADE IN AMERICA
SIGN, WE TEND TO THINK OF OTHER

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.592 align:start position:0%
THINGS AS INFERIOR.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.028
THINGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, WE
AUAUTOMATICALLY THINK THEY'RE NO

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.830 size:88% position:44%
GOING TO MEET OUR STANDARDS.

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:38.898 align:start position:0%
THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.534 align:start position:0%
THOSE TESTS WERE GOOD AND GOT
OUT THERE --

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:46.072
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THAT THE TEST
THAT'S USED IN OTHER PARTS TO

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.607 align:start position:0%
HAVE THE WORLD?

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.877 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
ADOPTED IT AND IT GOT USED IN

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.811 align:start position:0%
MANY COUNTRIES.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.846 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE USING IT IN MANY
COUNTRIES IN EUROPE.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.415
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THERE GOING TO
BE A TEST SOON THAT CAN BE MASS

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:57.616
PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES?

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.821
&gt;&gt; YES, THERE IS A TEST, AND
THERE HAS BEEN A TEST, BUT THEY

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:05.258 align:start position:0%
TRIED TO SCALE IT UP AND SEND IT
OUT TO ALL THE PLACES.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.027 align:start position:0%
THE INITIAL TEST WAS FLAWED, IT
DIDN'T WORK.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.998 align:start position:0%
THEY COULDN'T COUNT ON IT GIVING
CONCLUSIVE RESULTS.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.267 align:start position:0%
THEY PULLED EVERYTHING BACK AND
SAID WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.602 align:start position:0%
EVERYTHING OUT TO HAVE THE
C.D.C.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.872 align:start position:0%
WHAT'S STRIKING, THIS WEEK, IF
YOU GO TO THE C.D.C.'S

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.408 size:88% position:44%
WEB SITE -- AND WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR SIX

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:26.312
WEEKS, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN
SCREAMING INTO THE ABYSS, AND,

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:29.015 align:start position:0%
FRANKLY, YOU GET A LOT OF
PUSHBACK ON SOCIAL MEDIA SAYING

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.618
YOU'RE FEAR MONGERING, WHY ARE
YOU BEING SO CRITICAL, AND EVEN

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:36.656 align:start position:0%
IF YOU GO TO THE C.D.C.'S
WEB SITE NOW, ZERO TESTS BY THE

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.493
C.D.C. ON SOME DAYS THIS WEEK,
EIGHT TESTS BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:41.827 align:start position:0%
DEPARTMENTS.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.061 align:start position:0%
EIGHT.

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:51.003 align:start position:0%
NOT 8,000 OR 8 MILLION, EIGHT
TESTS TOTE BILL OUR PUBLIC OUR P

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:51.870 align:start position:0%
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:54.674 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND HOW MANY IN
SOUTH KOREA?

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.676 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SOUTH KOREA WAS DOING 10,000
A DAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.844 align:start position:0%
WE DON'T HAVE EYES ON THIS
THING.

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
IT'S ALWAYS DESCRIBED IN HUNTING
MMETAPHORS, BUT WE DON'T HAVE

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
EYES ON THIS.

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:10.656 align:start position:0%
EVEN THE NUMBERS TODAY WHICH
HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.394
LAST WEEK, WHEN THERE WERE 15
CASES, NOW THERE ARE MORE THAN

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:16.362 align:start position:0%
1,000 CASES.

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.998 align:start position:0%
I THINK THAT'S A GROSS
UNDERESTIMATE OF WHAT'S

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.166 align:start position:0%
HAPPENING HERE.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.367
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE ADDRESS THE PRESIDENT GAVE

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.469 size:81% position:41%
TO THE COUNTRY LAST NIGHT.

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:26.272
PRESIDENTS RARELY SPEAK FROM THE
OVAL OFFICE, ONLY TIMES USUALLY

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
OF CRISIS.

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:29.241 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:30.643 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LAST NIGHT, THE
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCE ADD EUROPEAN

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.011 align:start position:0%
TRAVEL BAN.

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:34.513 align:start position:0%
EUROPEAN LEADERS WERE CAUGHT
FLAT-FOOTED.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:37.650
THEY WERE NOT GIVEN A HEADS UP.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:42.555 align:start position:0%
THEY DENOUNCED IT, AND GLOBAL
STOCKS PLUNGED OVERNIGHT.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:45.791 align:start position:0%
IS THERE VALUE TO WHAT THE
PRESIDENT PROPOSED?

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:48.527
OR IS IT THE BARN DOOR IS SHUT?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.797
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK THAT METAPHOR
IS APPROPRIATE HERE, STEPHEN.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.502
I MEAN, PEOPLE WILL SAY, WHAT
ABOUT THE TRAVEL BAN ON CHINA

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:58.604 align:start position:0%
BACK IN JANUARY?

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:00.439
YOU REMEMBER, 195 AMERICANS
BROUGHT IN BY THAT FLIGHT AND

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:04.310 align:start position:0%
THEN PUT IN QUARANTINE AT THAT
AIR FORCE BASE, HUGE MOVE.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.812 align:start position:0%
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN 60 YEARS
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.715 align:start position:0%
LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED WAS
SMALLPOX.

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:11.050 align:start position:0%
IT WAS A BIG DECISION TO DO
THIS.

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:15.154
THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THERE'S
A LOT OF CASES OF CORONAVIRUS IN

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.357 size:81% position:41%
THIS COUNTRY, AND THEY ARE
SPREADING IN COMMUNITIES.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.998
SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO JUSTIFY
WWHY YOU WOULD DO A TRAVEL BAN

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:29.035
FROM COUNTRIES THAT MAY HAVE A
SIMILAR NUMBER OF CORONAVIRUS AS

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:32.838
WE DO AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
CASES WE HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:33.906 align:start position:0%
BEEN TESTING.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.675 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AS A MEDICAL
PROFESSIONAL, HAVE YOU HEARD

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.611 align:start position:0%
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION A
RATIONALE AS TO WHY CONTINENTAL

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:42.615
EUROPE MAY BE CUT OFF BUT THE
U.K. IS NOT OR SOUTH KOREA WAS

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:43.816 align:start position:0%
NOT?

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.619
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, THEY DID HAVE
THESE LEVEL THREE RESTRICTIONS

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:51.223
IN SOUTH KOREA, SO THEY HAD SOME
NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL AND THINGS

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:55.428
LIKE THAT, BUT, NO, IT DIDN'T
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE, ESPECIALLY

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.664 align:start position:0%
GIVEN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A
LITTLE STRAND OF RNA THAT

00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:02.501
DOESN'T RESPECT BORDERS OR
BOUNDARIES, IT TRAVELS FREELY

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:03.602 size:75% position:38%
ALL AROUND THESE PLACES.

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:10.242 size:84% position:42%
SO THE FACT YOU COULD ASH
ARBITRARILY SAY THIS -- AND

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:14.647 align:start position:0%
CHINA IS SAYING WE DON'T WANT
PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES COME

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.049 align:start position:0%
TOGETHERROUS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT
IT UNDER CONTROL.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:20.553 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY BELIEVE
THEY'RE PAST THE PEAK OF THE

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:20.987 align:start position:0%
EPIDEMIC.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.988 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.489 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT CAN WE LEARN
FROM THE CHINESE?

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:26.559
&gt;&gt; CHINA WAS VERY HEAVY HANDED.

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:28.961
THEY WERE SLOW COMING OUT TO
HAVE THE GATE IN NOVEMBER AND

00:05:28.994 --> 00:05:31.230
DECEMBER, BUT VERY HEAVY-HANDED.

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:34.700
THEY BASICALLY HAD THE LARGEST
QUARANTINE EVER RECORDED IN THE

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:38.037 align:start position:0%
HISTORY OF THE WORLD, 60 MILLION
PEOPLE UNDER QUARANTINE OVER

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.841
THERE, NOT LETTING PEOPLE IN OR
OUT, REALLY TRYING TO CONTAIN

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:43.042 align:start position:0%
THIS VIRUS.

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:45.077 align:start position:0%
THAT'S CONTAINMENT, WHICH IS
DIFFERENT THAN MITIGATION, WHICH

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.179 align:start position:0%
IS JUST SLOWING THE SPREAD OF
IT.

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.715
CONTAINMENT WAS THE NAME OF THE
GAME OVER THERE, SOMETHING THAT

00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:52.385 align:start position:0%
COULD HAPPEN IN CHINA, AND I
THINK YOU SAW THE --

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CAN IT HAPPEN IN
THE UNITED STATES?

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:57.456
WUHAN WAS THE FIRST PLACE THEY
CONTAINED AND THE AREA AROUND

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:58.290 align:start position:0%
IT.

00:05:58.323 --> 00:06:00.793 align:start position:0%
THAT CITY ITSELF IS 11 MILLION
PEOPLE.

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:01.694
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, SMALL CHINESE CITY.

00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:03.896 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: EXACTLY, A SMALL
CHINESE CITY.

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:07.700
IT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF
SAY FOG ONE IN THE NEW YORK

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:09.835 align:start position:0%
METROPOLITAN AREA CAN GO IN OR
GO OUT.

00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:12.004 align:start position:0%
ARE WE HEADED THAT WAY?

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.273 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK WE COULD EVER
DO WHAT THEY DID IN CHINA.

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:17.543
IN ORDER FOR QUARANTINES LIKE
THAT TO WORK, FIRST OF ALL, YOU

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:20.913
HAVE TO DO IT EARLY, YOU HAVE TO
BE VERY CONSISTENT, AND EVERYONE

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:24.150 align:start position:0%
HAS TO BE SUPER HONEST ABOUT
THIS.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:25.918 size:81% position:41%
IN CHINA, IT WAS MANDATED.

00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:29.021 align:start position:0%
IT'S A DIFFERENT RULE OF LAW
THERE.

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:32.425
EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT THIS -- THE
AUTOCRACY AND WHAT THAT REALLY

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:36.028 align:start position:0%
MEANS WHEN IT COMES TO
GOVERNMENT, AND, IN MANY WAYS,

00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:39.265
THERE'S A LOT OF NEGATIVES, BUT
WITH THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION,

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:41.434
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T THINK CAN BE DONE

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:44.670 align:start position:0%
IN HARDLY ANY TO HAVE THE OTHER
PLACES IN THE WORLD.

00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:49.575
BUT ONE THING I WANT TO POINT
OUT, THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY MODEL

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:50.809 align:start position:0%
OF SUCCESS.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:56.515
YOU LOOK AT SINGAPORE, HONG KONG
UPTHAT BORDERS MAINLAND CHINA,

00:06:56.548 --> 00:07:01.253 align:start position:0%
THEY HAVE HAD ABOUT 120 PATIENTS
DIAGNOSED.

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:04.590
BUT A LOT OF THINGS CAN BE DONE
BUT THEY HAVE TO BE DONE EARLY.

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:07.893 align:start position:0%
TALL MEASURES IN TERMS OF SOCIAL
DISTANCING CAN HAVE A REAL

00:07:07.926 --> 00:07:09.094 align:start position:0%
IMPACT THEN.

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:11.063 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF YOU CAN STICK
AROUND FOR ONE MORE ACT, WE HAVE

00:07:11.096 --> 00:07:13.365 size:88% position:44%
TO TAKE ANOTHER COMMERCIAL
BREAK, BUT COME BACK BECAUSE

00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:17.770 align:start position:0%
WE'LL HAVE MORE OF DR. SANJAY
GUPTA TALKING ABOUT CORONAVIRUS,

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
FACT VERSUS FICTION.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:20.406 align:start position:0%
STICK AROUND.
