00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.480
I was watching this episode of the simpsons
the other day where Lisa thinks she’s going

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.260
to get dumber as she gets older because she
has the Simpson’s gene.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.800
Lisa: "It can't just be a bad day. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute."

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.900
Her brother and her father and her uncles
have it, so she must have it, right?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.700
Grandpa: "That's right, then the Simpson's gene kicks in!"

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.680
But she finds out, there’s a catch

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.180
"The defective Simpson's gene is on the Y chromosome, so only men are affected"

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.300
And it got me thinking, what do we actually
really know about the Y chromsome. And how

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.880
did we get there?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.520
"What does the "Y" stand for?"

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.219
There were a lot of fascinating TV shows about
genetics in the 1950s

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.219
"We are about to unfold for you an adventure in the world of science"

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.480
They taught us that nearly every person has 23 pairs of Y chromosomes

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.095
"In every male human being, the 23rd pair of chromosomes is a mismatch"

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:56.935
"One type has a long X chromosome. The other type has a short Y chromosome"

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.280
Early on we learned that most girls have two x
chromosomes and most boys have an X and a Y

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.820
And then this happened

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.560
A man with XYY was discovered

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.340
He was a normal guy living a normal life

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.479
A few years later some researchers started
drawing lines between having an extra Y chromosome

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.579
and a life of violent crime.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.379
"Some studies from the 70s said that a man with an extra Y chromosome meant a man was more aggressive" 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.080
It all started at a scottish mental institution
where 315 men were genetically tested for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.829
chromosomal abnormalities. 9 of these men
were above average height, had severe mental

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.049
impairments, had criminal records, and had
XYY chromosomes.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.869
Although these 9 men had criminal backgrounds
almost identical to men without XYY. Scientist

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.250
concluded that their history was directly
related to their genetic disorder.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.670
"So he has an extra Y chromosome, that's the criminal gene"

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.680
Then, Mary Telfer, a researcher in the U.S.
began searching for the XYY chromosome in

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.159
developmentally disabled boys in institutions
in Pennsylvania. They were tall and had moderate

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.280
acne on their face and in her mind these were
clear signs of XYY.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.140
"Kilhurst research center says he's an XYY man. Do you believe in that theory?"

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.390
Around that time a tall man in Chicago with
visible acne scars on his face brutally raped

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.960
and murdered 8 nurses. His name was Richard
Speck. It immediately made sense to Telfer

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.320
that he was XYY.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.540
The New York Times latched onto this story
and ran a series about the genetic disorder

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.080
stating that Speck’s criminal disposition
was directly related to the fact that he was

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.050
a “supermale” with an extra Y chromosome.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.140
Genetic testing however, concluded that he
was XY. But the damage was done. The idea

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.880
of a genetic mutant supermale quickly became
a cultural phenomenon.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.520
"Well they've found I've got this, um, extra male chromosome"

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.490
Not surprisingly there was this huge bias
in the research conducted on XYY men. Nearly

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.970
all genetic testing of these chromosomes were
conducted in prisons and mental institutions.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.460
"Wait, so the extra Y chromosome doesn't lead to violence"

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.600
The fact is, about 1 in 1000 men have XYY
syndrome and a vast majority are completely

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.410
unaware of their condition. There’s just
no proven correlation between aggressive criminal

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.790
behavior and having an extra Y chromosome.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.690
"The extra Y means nothing at all"

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.110
Most people know that there’s not a murder
gene in our bodies that make us criminals,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.130
but we still use the Y chromosome as a huge
cultural symbol for aggression and masculinity.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.170
"Pick up a Y chromosome while you were there, you might be short one"

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.140
A lack of a Y chromosome means a guy is super
feminine and an extra Y chromosome means he’s

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.890
a killer.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.150
And then there’s Jenna Maroney.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.390
"Jenna is an Ashkenazi Jew with an extra Y chromosome?"

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.010
"What's that now?"

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.800
When you’re watching your favorite TV show,
it’s important to remember that masculinity

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.540
and femininity are as much defined by the
world around us, as the genes inside us.
