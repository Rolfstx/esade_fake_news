00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:03.169
[♪♪♪]

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.505
[Makda] It's a chilly
night in late November.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:09.009
And a woman sits in the
middle of an emergency.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.511
I'm locked out of my place.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.981
[Makda] Help is on the way,
she's told.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.083
But as we're
about to find out...

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.751
Hey!

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.453
[man] Sorry about the wait.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:25.291
[Makda] There are no guarantees
when you're picking a locksmith.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.030
The woman, in fact, is a
Marketplace producer.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.535
And this house is a testing
ground that we've rigged up

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:36.870
with hidden cameras.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.439
Well, I think those
all look pretty good.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.442
Yeah, it's pretty good.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.844
[Makda] Our plan is
to call locksmiths

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:47.180
over the next few nights.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.849
-There we go...
-There, we know that one.

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:52.418
Check Point Door and Lock.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.820
We've heard a lot
about this one.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.222
[Makda] From companies
we've heard might not give us

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.290
a fair shake.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.861
It says $15-- 15
minute response time.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.232
[Makda] John Seitz is with us.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:11.304
He's got ten years experience as
a locksmith, and we've hired him

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:13.005
to help with our test.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.942
I wanna show you-- we've
got some cameras set up.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.877
-[Makda] Let's go inside.
-[John] Sounds good.

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:20.980
[Makda] Together,
we'll be in a back room...

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.784
And if I just click here,
we get a closer look.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:25.852
[John] Lovely.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.888
[Makda] Watching for signs of
shoddy service, and much more.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.759
Like what happens
to Dorothy Sterling.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.262
He just couldn't
get the lock to work.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.597
[Makda] She's 94.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.133
And needed the antique
lock on her front door fixed.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.237
And he kept trying and he just
couldn't get it to work because

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.939
he didn't know what to do.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:49.843
[Makda] The locksmith is both
inexperienced, she says,

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.110
and threatening.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.415
He told me he was going to
remove the lock,

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.649
and leave me with nothing.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.854
[Makda] Now it's her carpenter,
Titus, who's fixing

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.289
the mess left behind.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.727
So as you can see here, he broke
the door in several places.

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.096
[Makda] Titus feels bad
because he's the one who

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.397
found the locksmith.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.634
So I called three different
companies, and the one that

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.836
responded to me
first was Check Point.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.407
[Makda] Online, Check Point
promises safety, trust,

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.542
and peace of mind.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.612
Customers, though, post reviews
that use words like "horrible",

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:29.549
"overpriced", and
"highway robbery".

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:34.720
As you can see, this is the
lock which they installed.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.389
[Makda] The Check Point
locksmith can't fix

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.890
Dorothy's old lock.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.626
And the new one he
installs is poorly designed.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.695
-Every time you turn this--
-You're knocking against that?

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.196
You're knocking-- your thumb
would be knocking

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.331
against this right here.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.200
[Makda] To top it off, Dorothy
says she is charged

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.802
twice what she's quoted.

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.239
And by the end of the
ordeal, pays $1,500.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.642
It was not a good
experience for anybody.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:01.147
Especially for...a woman, alone.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:06.285
[Makda] Back at our test house,
we're going to call Check Point.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.421
So that's the housing...

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:11.890
[Makda] But first, our expert
John is helping plan our test,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.860
with a brand new
lock he's re-setting.

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.598
So you're replacing the pins
with ones that would be

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:19.732
easier to pick?

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.100
Yes.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.035
[Makda] He says just about
anyone will be able

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.103
to pick this lock.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.772
Maybe even me.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.307
He gives me a few pointers.

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.577
And then you're just going to
get the pins to move up and down

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:34.613
just like the key
would, one at a time.

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:36.950
[Makda] And in roughly
three and a half minutes...

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.417
Take it all out?

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:39.852
Take it all out,
because it is picked.

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:43.790
And then it's with a
flathead screwdriver,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.091
you finish the turn.

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:47.260
-That's it?
-That's it.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.762
[Makda] We're in.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.497
Is this a fair
experiment, though?

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.165
Yes.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:56.002
It's obviously been made easier,
I would call it a good test

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.936
for beginners.

00:03:57.936 --> 00:04:00.606
So anyone claiming
to be a locksmith,

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:02.575
they should be able to
get through it.

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:07.647
[Makda] As day turns to night,
we set our test in motion...

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.281
Hi there, I hope
you can help me,

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.482
I'm locked out of my place...

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.452
[Makda] With a
call to Check Point.

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:25.465
[Makda] It's one of the
cheapest quotes we find.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.434
How much do you think
it usually costs then?

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.136
Like 15, plus 35?

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:43.650
[Makda] It's over an
hour of waiting.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.419
And then...

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.254
I think that might be him.

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:49.922
Are you the locksmith?

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.394
Are you check--
you're Check Point?

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.897
[Makda] The one thing he
makes clear quickly...

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:00.400
There's no way to pick the lock.

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:11.577 line:76%
[woman] No...
No.

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:14.613
[Makda] Not true,
says our expert.

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:18.318
Any locksmith seeing this
lock should know it can be

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.020
easily picked, but his
only solution is to drill.

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:23.356
Does that mean
it's more expensive?

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:30.195
[She gasps] $350!

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:33.166
Okay, 'cause they said it was
going to be like, 35, plus--

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.782
[Makda] Plus about
$90 for a new lock.

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:53.018
Our producer urges him
again to try picking.

00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:54.987
Are you sure you
can't just pick it?

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:58.424
You can't pick this?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.196
A year?

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.965
That's what he said.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.369
He said it-- that you
couldn't pick this lock.

00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:12.672
Can you pick that lock?

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.943
I picked it in 3 minutes and 30
seconds with your help there.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.414
And I do remind you that I
did not teach you very well.

00:06:22.814 --> 00:06:25.684
[Makda] Before he breaks out
the drill, we ask one more time.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.587
Okay, and you don't
think we can pick it?

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:31.023
[Laughing] Okay.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.595
Okay.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.298
[Makda] He spends the next
two minutes or so trying,

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.533
but with no luck.

00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:44.036
Thank you for trying.

00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:53.579
[Makda] Locksmiths are
supposed to ask for ID,

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.781
proof we live here,
right off the bat.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:59.818
But this Check Point technician
is well into destroying our lock

00:06:59.818 --> 00:07:01.687
by the time he finally asks.

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:06.259
Y-yes...
Yes.

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:10.329
Yeah, I'm renting it, yeah.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.298
I rent it, yeah.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:16.435
Uh, I couldn't get a hold of
her today-- but it's okay,

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:17.503
she'll be okay.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.809
[Makda] He doesn't
finish the thought,

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:25.211
but does finish the job.

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:26.311
[woman] You got it.

00:07:26.311 --> 00:07:27.579
[Makda] Including a new lock.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.816
Our expert, though,
is not impressed.

00:07:30.982 --> 00:07:32.952
What are you thinking right now?

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.522
That was everything
I didn't want it to be.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.659
[Makda] A bigger surprise
awaits, when it's time

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:40.760
to settle the bill.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.763
Okay, so how much-- I'm totally
confused as to the price.

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:46.199
No!

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.203
No.

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:54.640
If I give you cash
can you do like 450?

00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:58.611
[Makda] And with that,
the call ends.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.179
[woman] Bye...

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.815
[Makda] We contact Check Point.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.918
They admit their locksmith
should have asked for ID,

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:08.320
tried harder to pick the lock,
and should have quoted a

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.622
final price before
starting the job.

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:13.959
Check Point is now
updating its procedures.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:16.695
And agrees to
compensate 94-year-old Dorothy.

00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:18.397
This is your industry.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.765
Yeah.

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:21.400
This is the worst
part of my industry.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.469
This is the worst part.

00:08:24.436 --> 00:08:26.138
I'm glad you're taking
a good look at it,

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:29.842
I have heard all about it,
but that was sad.

00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:32.678
That was just really sad.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.816
You almost look like
you're taking it personally.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.988
This is my livelihood that I
just watched someone make

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.823
a joke out of.

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.997
[Makda] This is
your Marketplace.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.200
[Phone ringing]

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.505
Oh, hey, is this
Locksmith Experts?

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.311
[Makda] It's the second night of
our test house, and we're on the

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.146
phone with a company
called Locksmith Experts.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.885
I have locked myself out of my
house, I can't find my keys.

00:09:14.753 --> 00:09:17.889
[Makda] The Better Business
Bureau says Locksmith Experts

00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:21.126
has a "pattern of complaints,"
mostly about over-charging.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.031
As one reviewer puts it,
"these people are not experts,

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.131
"they are thieves."

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:29.835
The company admits it has a
few unhappy customers--

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.537
but says most are satisfied.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.309
Yep.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.247
Oh, how much, how much do
you think that might be?

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:47.420
[Makda] We heard a similar quote
last night from a different

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.223
locksmith, and it
ends up costing $450.

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:56.128
He said the lock was
un-pickable and insisted on

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.663
destroying it to let us in.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:03.169
Our expert John is back with us.

00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:07.373
And once again, he's reset a
brand-new lock to make it

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.407
easier to pick.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.880
[Makda] This is night two,
what are you expecting?

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:17.816
[John] I'm hoping for
much better tonight.

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:24.023
Just a straight call, honesty,
an attempt to pick the lock.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:26.392
[Makda] Oh, there we go,
car's pulling in.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.229
Hi, are you my locksmith?

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.964
Hi.

00:10:33.965 --> 00:10:35.067
I'm okay.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:38.237
[Makda] He says his name is
Serge, and the very next thing

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.106
he says is the proper thing.

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:44.477
Uh, I do.

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:48.914
[Makda] We show Serge ID and a
rental agreement to prove we

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:52.051
live here-- and he immediately
tries picking the lock.

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:57.590
Okay, okay.

00:10:59.224 --> 00:11:00.559
Is that like, on top of the...

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:02.861
Okay.

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:04.830
Like a service call,
sort of thing?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.609
You're not?

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:20.413
Oh, wow.
Thank you!

00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:24.983
You're smiling, is that how
it's supposed to be done?

00:11:24.983 --> 00:11:26.185
Yeah, that's how it's
supposed to be done.

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:28.687
[Makda] Unlike the many
complaints we hear about

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:31.890
Locksmith Experts, our
experience with Serge

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.326
is going well--
until it's time to pay.

00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:36.796
How much can I give you?

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.635
Uh, yeah.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.438
Oh, wow.
Okay.

00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:48.741
[Makda] $80 And a Google review.

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:50.176
[woman] Thank you.

00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:56.148
[Makda] Problem is, it's
against Google guidelines

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:57.749
to offer incentives
for a review.

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:00.752
And when we tell
Locksmith Experts, they say

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:02.354
it shouldn't have happened.

00:12:02.654 --> 00:12:04.023
It's against their policy.

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:06.391
But there are other things
about this company that

00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:07.760
are raising questions.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:11.230
Like for some reason,
they show up when you call

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.598
Port Credit Locksmith.

00:12:13.098 --> 00:12:14.132
Or Brampton Locksmith.

00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:15.668
Or Rouge Locksmith.

00:12:17.469 --> 00:12:20.672
So we couldn't open the door
and the next day we had a big

00:12:20.672 --> 00:12:22.774
gathering here in the garden...

00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:26.511
[Makda] It's Birchmount
Locksmith when Tom Gehrels

00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:28.013
calls them last summer.

00:12:28.446 --> 00:12:31.349
I looked on Google Maps because
I wanted to use somebody local

00:12:31.349 --> 00:12:35.287
that had a good reputation, and
looked at three different ones,

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:38.189
found this one called Birchmount
Locksmith which you know,

00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:39.725
seemed to be right up
the street from us.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:43.295
[Makda] They quote Tom a price
of $30 for the service call.

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.831
45 and up for the
lock replacement.

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.334
So what was your impression
of this locksmith

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.601
when they showed up?

00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:54.373
The $45 "and up" now went to
$100 just to open the door and

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:57.742
on top of that, $185
to replace the lock.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.645
[Makda] Tom fights back,
and gets a discount,

00:13:00.645 --> 00:13:04.316
but what he really doesn't like
is the fact Birchmount Locksmith

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.984
doesn't actually do the job.

00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:09.655
It turned out he was working for
a company out of concord called

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.257
"Locksmith Experts".

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.526
[Makda] Sure enough, the
receipt says Locksmith Experts.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.729
So what happened to Birchmount?

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:20.999
We invite Tom to go looking
for answers, just up the street.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.835
There's 530 there.

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:24.670
Okay, it's on this
side of the street, then.

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.572
[Makda] Google Maps tells us
Birchmount locksmith should be

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:28.774
right around here.

00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:30.342
What's the number again?

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:32.043
572.

00:13:32.277 --> 00:13:34.313
Okay this is a
building at 570...

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.550
And this should be 572.

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:41.253
[Tom] There's nothing here.

00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:43.422
It's just an empty lot.

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.858
There's no locksmith here.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:46.925
[Makda] It doesn't
look like it.

00:13:46.925 --> 00:13:48.193
No.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.196
Why do you think they
would pick this address?

00:13:51.196 --> 00:13:53.631
I guess they just
don't want to be found.

00:13:53.631 --> 00:13:55.701
Clearly there's
something scuzzy going on.

00:13:56.668 --> 00:13:59.138
[Makda] We ask
Locksmith Experts to explain.

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:01.673
They say they act as a
subcontractor for many

00:14:01.673 --> 00:14:03.208
companies.

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:05.611
And did not create
any fake listings.

00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:14.019
Back at our test house, we want
to know how far the fakery goes

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.854
in the locksmith industry.

00:14:16.255 --> 00:14:19.425
Okay, so this is right
near where we are...

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.359
[Makda] So we try
searching Google for

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:23.795
"a locksmith near me",
and find a company called

00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:26.065
Certified Locksmith Etobicoke.

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:27.666
Right there.

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:29.468
Yeah, Certified
Locksmith Etobicoke.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.636
Let's just pull it up.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.639
It's supposed to be
right in the neighbourhood.

00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:37.809
Oh hey, I'm wondering
if you can help me.

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:40.612
[Makda] But when we call
Certified and ask who, exactly,

00:14:40.612 --> 00:14:42.981
will be coming,
things get confusing.

00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:45.384
What's the name of the
locksmith that shows up?

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:49.621
It's FC Locksmith.

00:14:50.188 --> 00:14:52.658
[Makda] FC Locksmith claims to
be one of the best

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.860
locksmith companies in Toronto.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:58.597
And seems to have
branches in Ottawa and Calgary.

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:02.334
So why is FC coming up as
Certified on Google Maps?

00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:07.406
We decide that instead of a
locksmith coming to us,

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:08.907
we'll go to the locksmith.

00:15:09.207 --> 00:15:11.809
So we're going to go to
Certified Locksmith Etobicoke,

00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:13.378
it says it's six minutes away.

00:15:13.378 --> 00:15:14.980
[phone] Certified Locksmith
Etobicoke may be closed by the

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.381
time you arrive.

00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:19.885
[Makda] Our GPS leads
the way toward Certified--

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:23.389
or maybe FC-- Locksmith,
and in minutes...

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:27.392
There it is,
2975 Bloor Street West.

00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:29.328
-It's right there.
-It's right there.

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.796
That does not look
like a locksmith company.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:33.532
That does not look
like a locksmith company.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.935
But it says right here, it
says 2975 Bloor Street West,

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.038
Certified Locksmith Etobicoke.

00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:43.641
But Parama is there,
which looks like--

00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:45.443
-A credit union.
-A credit union, yeah.

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:48.314
[Makda] The deception,
we discover, doesn't end here.

00:15:49.414 --> 00:15:52.885
We find more than 20 fake
locksmith locations

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:56.388
around Toronto saying they
are linked to FC Locksmith.

00:15:57.288 --> 00:16:01.059
Which makes us wonder about all
these five-star reviews we see

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:03.495
on FC's Google business listing.

00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:07.766
When we dig deeper, we figure
out most of them are fakes too.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.836
Dalton Fincher is actually
American astronaut

00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:15.207
Clayton Anderson, seen here on
the Space Shuttle Discovery.

00:16:17.075 --> 00:16:21.079
And Denver Cothron is actually
Ian Roland, a lawyer who happens

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:23.215
to work just next door to us.

00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:29.087
So we head over to see
if Ian Roland knows his image

00:16:29.087 --> 00:16:32.091
is being used to
promote FC Locksmith.

00:16:33.725 --> 00:16:37.962
So this is the company here,
you can see there's 57 reviews.

00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:41.333
And if I scroll down,
there you are.

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:43.534
That's your picture, right?

00:16:43.534 --> 00:16:45.804
[Ian] Denver!
[He laughs]

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.539
-[Makda] Your name's Denver?
-Denver.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:49.107
Interesting.

00:16:49.574 --> 00:16:52.110
"I got locked out of
my car the other day.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.813
"They responded right
away and solved the problem.

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:57.850
"The technician that
came was a real lifesaver."

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.585
I have no idea
what that's about.

00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:03.622
I certainly didn't get
locked out of my car.

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:05.224
That's not you?

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.258
That's not me.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:07.759
No, it's not me.

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.461
Well, the picture's me,
but nothing else is.

00:17:10.228 --> 00:17:12.731
And I have no idea
how they got it.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:15.968
There are a lot of fake
reviews on this site.

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:19.838
I'm a lawyer, it's an
appropriation of my image.

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.673
I may have to pursue it.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.676
-Thank you for that information.
-You're welcome.

00:17:26.244 --> 00:17:29.047
[Makda] A one-star review
we managed to find on

00:17:29.047 --> 00:17:32.584
FC's Google listing comes with
a twist of irony.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:37.456
A man named Colin tells
people to not use this company.

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:41.260
He says the locksmith "mangled,
scratched and dinged" his door.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:47.098
In response, FC calls it
a fake review, and says,

00:17:47.098 --> 00:17:48.967
"It's just one of our
competitors."

00:17:50.535 --> 00:17:53.605
But we track down Colin, who
doesn't want to come on camera,

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:56.008
and both he and
his review are real.

00:17:57.109 --> 00:18:00.779
FC denies allegations of
fake reviews or locations.

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.782
It says all those positive
reviews could have been

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:06.418
posted by anyone,
and they're checking with their

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:08.921
marketing company about
any fake locations.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.060
[Makda] This is
your Marketplace.

00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:20.866
We're mapping out deception
in the locksmith industry.

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:23.902
[woman] So you're in your house.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.303
You're locked out.

00:18:25.303 --> 00:18:27.639
You want something nearby,
you call something that looks

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:30.675
ten minutes away.
Like, ten minutes away, tops.

00:18:30.675 --> 00:18:32.777
-A local locksmith.
-A local locksmith.

00:18:32.777 --> 00:18:35.914
And what you actually get is
a grocery store,

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:38.450
not the locksmith company
you have called.

00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:43.254
[Makda] Each of these red dots
represents a supposed locksmith

00:18:43.254 --> 00:18:45.657
company in the Toronto area.

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:49.093
But after months of digging,
we discover none of them are

00:18:49.093 --> 00:18:50.729
real locksmith locations.

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:52.764
Here's what they really are...

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:54.999
Drug stores and retail stores.

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:57.035
Parking lots and gas stations.

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:59.338
Strip malls and banks.

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.841
It makes us wonder,
how much can you really trust

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.309
Google map searches?

00:19:10.248 --> 00:19:12.918
Mike Blumenthal is a
search engine consultant.

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:17.255
He helps businesses get exposure
through local Google searches.

00:19:17.255 --> 00:19:19.424
In locksmiths,
in appliance repair,

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:21.660
in moving and
garage door opening.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.896
Any home service business,
you see a massive amount of

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.865
fake listings at the present.

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.266
What's the harm in that?

00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:29.600
Well, the harm is severalfold.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.870
One is legitimate businesses
can't compete, the other is it's

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.039
very deceptive to the consumer.

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:36.074
A lot of times these businesses
that are willing to cheat on

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.810
their listings are also willing
to cheat on the reviews,

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.279
willing to cheat at who they
send out to repair.

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:43.214
They could be sending people
into your home that are not

00:19:43.214 --> 00:19:45.984
either qualified to be there or
shouldn't be there because of

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:48.053
background issues.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.689
But doesn't Google have
rules against fake listings?

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.624
They have a lot of rules
against fake listings,

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:53.925
but they don't
enforce the rules.

00:19:54.492 --> 00:19:57.162
[Makda] We tell Google and the
locksmith companies about all

00:19:57.162 --> 00:20:00.231
the fake listings we've
uncovered, and now all of them

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.600
have been taken down.

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:06.571
Google says because of our
investigation, they're auditing

00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:09.174
all locksmith
listings across Canada.

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:14.445
But Mike says it will take more
than investigations like ours to

00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:15.347
solve the bigger problem.

00:20:16.414 --> 00:20:19.917
It's gone beyond trusting Google
as a business to fix these

00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:21.119
issues.

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.322
After watching this for 11
years, the only solution is a

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:24.756
political one.

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:27.759
There needs to be rules at the
regulatory level with serious

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:30.195
consequences.

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:33.431
Financial and perhaps even
criminal consequences to both

00:20:33.431 --> 00:20:36.467
the businesses that create fake
listings and deceive people, as

00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:37.869
well as to Google.

00:20:39.103 --> 00:20:42.340
[Makda] It's the only way, he
says, we'll ever truly close the

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.142
door on deception.
