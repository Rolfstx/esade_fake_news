00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
a poet needs a pen a painter a brush and
a director an army said Orson Welles

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:21.020
Apparently he was a total dick.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.380
Lately it seems like the dicks have been winning. This is not just because of Donald Trump
or the rising tide of authoritarian

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.230
leaders around the world but something
I've experienced personally you see I've

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.460
always loved making movies whenever I
met someone who worked with a famous

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.420
director I'd ask what are they like
and nine times out of ten they'd say

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.059
well he's kind of a dick and I'd be
disappointed. You can read about James

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.520
Cameron terrorizing his actors to the
point of mental breakdown on the abyss

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.910
or about Stanley Kubrick browbeating
Shelley Duvall into hysterics while

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.629
shooting The Shining Michael Bay's name
comes up again and again when talking

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.690
about dick directors
I'd always chalked these stories up to

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.640
inflated ego and abuse of power
until I directed a movie of my own

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:15.790
It had movie stars it had trucks
it had producers it had crafting it had

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.290
Zac Efron.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.710
I approached the movie like
a kid in a candy store. Really bright-eyed enthusiastic accessible and democratic.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.259
I made friends with the actors and the crew and I really cared about keeping up a good vibe.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.470
It was a trial by fire
and as I quickly gathered empirical data

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.410
on set I found that people responded to
me more when I was snappy tired or moody

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.070
Maybe there was something to being a
dick after all. Maybe it was actually the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.960
key to those legendary directors success
I came away from the experience both

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130
confused and fascinated by the subject
of leadership. This was a whole other

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.710
discipline and it would take a study of
its own. So that's what I'm doing I'm

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.430
going to interview directors writers and
thinkers on the subject of leadership

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.869
and maybe they can tell me once and for
all whether or not you need to be a dick

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.700
to be a great leader.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:25.010
In an effort to answer this question of whether or not I have to be a dick to be successful we are going to interview Davis Guggenheim.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.250
the Academy award-winning director I'm
kind of in the red here I might be able

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.520
to pull up a little bit see I don't want
to be a dick and park in front of

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:43.310
someone's driveway one two this is Davis
one two three four Davis Guggenheim has

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.400
directed documentaries features and
television shows in 2007 he won the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.780
Academy Award for Best Documentary for
An Inconvenient Truth so the basis of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.250
this is you having done a movie and
you're like I just went through the storm and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.590
I come out saying Who am I and what is a
great director and can I be that person

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.120
I like to consider myself a nice guy. Some people may not say that. You seem like a nice guy
guy

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.519
I seem like a nice guy. Do you think being a nice guy gets in the way of you directing?

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.610
I do. You know I made this film called Gossip for Warner Brothers and it

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.920
had pretty good cast. It had Kate Hudson
and James Marsden and Norman Reedus and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.239
Josh Jackson and really good cast and I
spent the whole time getting them to

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.700
like me I think by the end they didn't
like me I wanted to be their friends and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.900
they didn't want to be my friend they
wanted a director so there's some of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.400
that you know there is something about
wanting a boss and there is something

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.620
about and I was too young to know it was
my first job and maybe I leaned on that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.820
quality of my personality too much. You see the problem with your position about

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.840
being nice Jones nice people don't live
life

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.260
I don't want to go through all my days
being all sweet and polite and realize

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.030
when I'm 80 that I'm just some nice dead person. Peter Berg who used to be I was used to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.540
be really close friend of mine the first
the night before the first day of

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.639
shooting I did on a television show he
said show up and within the first two

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.600
hours fire somebody cause then everyone will be afraid of you you should talk to Peter Berg. You really should.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.229
Peter Berg got his start in Hollywood acting in movies like Aspen

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.660
extreme the great white hype and TV
shows like Chicago Hope then he

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.770
transitioned into directing big movies
like Hancock action movies like

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.419
battleship and raw emotional movies like
Friday night lights he did the TV show too

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.729
and if that wasn't bad ass enough he just
completed the Mark Wahlberg trilogy with

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.350
lone survivor deepwater horizon and
Patriots day clearly with all of his

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.660
success he was doing something right

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.890
so I contacted him and he invited me up
to Boston where he was shooting Patriot's Day.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.950
Okay so I just got to Boston I'm
taking a taxi from the airport

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.090
unfortunately I just got word from Peter
Berg's assistant that Peter would rather

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.100
not do the interview here but would
rather do it back in LA once he finishes

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.100
production kind of a bummer because he
told me to come up to Boston this week

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.910
and now I'm finally flew up I've got a
hotel I paid for the flight and everything

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.810
and now he doesn't want to meet until
after he's back in LA so not really much

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.890
I can do. Is this a dick move? Perhaps.
Since I was already on the East Coast I

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.730
decided to go down to Chevy Chase
Maryland to learn a little more about

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:59.250
what makes guys like Peter Berg so
effective. Hello Dr. Maccoby.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.280
Maccoby. You're Max. I'm Max Joseph. Dr. Michael Maccoby has written extensively

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.040
on leadership and central to all of his
writing is a type of person called a

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.000
narcissist. Narcissistic type is a person
who lacks a strong super-ego lacks a

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.390
strong conscience but has a has instead
an ego ideal you can see it in some of

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:30.210
the great leaders like Abraham Lincoln
see it in Barack Obama in his autobiography

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.980
talks about creating a sense of who he
is

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.310
narcissists reject the world as it is
and instead have a vision of how it

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.840
should be and those people are kind of
driven to be leaders because they have a

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.360
vision they have a sense of what they
want to create how they want to change

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.670
the world common traits among all
narcissists include an undeniable

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.620
charisma unshakable conviction not
listening to anyone except for

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.520
themselves being slightly paranoid over
controlling lacking in empathy and being

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.400
occasionally cruel the reason they're
abusive is because they have such a

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.139
powerful vision
and they're going to make sure it's

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:24.090
going to be they're going to realize it
now that can be a terrible vision like

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:30.569
Hitler but a lot of people bought into
it because they believed he was going to

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:35.550
make Germany great glory he's going to
create glory even though they were going

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:43.289
to be a lot of blood Make Germany Great
Again. Yeah right. I'm going to make our

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:54.500
country rich again Donald Trump is an
asshole if you had any doubt. I

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:00.790
think it's essential to his success

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:06.330
Aaron James is the world's leading
expert on assholes. The world can be divided

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.969
into two kinds of people assholes and
non assholes

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.530
James imagines a world where there are
cooperative people who play by the rules

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.830
and do as they're told
keeping their promises not being

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.870
too rude and then there's the asshole
who takes advantage of other people

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.590
doing their part if the average person
feels special on their birthday the

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:35.250
assholes birthday comes every day he
cuts in line interrupts often and drives

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.800
like well an asshole
the asshole does these things out of an

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.240
entrenched sense of entitlement they're
entrenched in it in a sense that it's

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.740
very difficult for them to see things
differently meaning this is how they're

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:56.340
wired who is your kind of model of a
great leader who's not an asshole who

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:16.740
do you think of a great leader who is not an asshole... um let me think about this...it was starting to sound like being an asshole

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:24.210
was essential for success so I read up
on how to become one when somebody

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:30.150
challenges you fight back be brutal be
tough to prove how he would bring soldiers

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.620
under his firm control Sun Tzu beheaded the Kings two favorite concubines

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.660
when they failed to command the company
of women to have the ultimate victory

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:46.140
you must be ruthless it is easier to cope with a bad conscience than a bad reputation

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.370
I was getting the message that
I needed to turn myself into a

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.840
cold-blooded alpha male with killer
instinct so I decided to get another

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.920
perspective on the matter

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:09.360
do you always film the opening part? Yeah.
okay wish I'd known that, but thanks. For the last 16

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.070
years Karyn Kusama has directed projects
across all platforms from Indies like

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.540
the invitation to big studio features
like Jennifer's Body and Aeon Flux to

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.230
high profile television shows like the
man in the high castle and billions

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:30.089
close the fucking door I think we
cherish this idea of the single-minded

00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:36.080
ambitious driven I want to say almost

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:44.060
socially maladjusted male director like
we love that trope

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.410
I think the question gets complicated
when you're female because the idea of

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:55.490
not caring that can seem visionary if
you're male not caring about what other

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.990
people think if you're female is
considered sort of disrespectful and

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:09.220
sociopathic I do think women require a
completely different kind of toughness

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:19.510
it's a willingness to to really listen I
mean like hear an opposing point of view

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.430
really listen to it occasionally say
okay I need to just think about this it

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.990
gets more tricky when you're working in
situations where you're not getting what

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.320
you want and you have to keep saying
okay this isn't really what I was

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.790
talking about let me reiterate here is
what I want sometimes you've just got to

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.760
say I'm sorry I completely disagree with
you if we have to keep talking about

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.400
this maybe this isn't a relationship
meant to be Karin wasn't a dick but she

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.820
was tough so there is a new update in
the Pete Berg saga how should we do it

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.600
so yesterday I sent him a text message
in the morning I said Pete I swear this

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.230
is the last time I'm going to reach out
to you regarding this interview truth is

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.950
that I actually flew up to Boston and
rented a hotel room just to interview

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.910
you on your suggestion a few months ago
but as I was in the cab leaving the

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.440
airport I got word from your assistant
saying that you'd rather do it in LA

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.460
that kind of sucked but I took it in
stride because I really wanted to

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.750
include you in this would really mean a
lot to me in the piece please say yes

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:27.800
praying hands emoji to which Pete
actually texted me back and said hey I

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.730
don't know you I have no idea what
you're doing I'm not doing anything on

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:37.100
camera until I know more show me some of your cut call Lauren that's his assistant

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.410
It was a frightening text to get
back and it kind of shook me to the core

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:48.560
but I did get a response maybe I pushed
too hard maybe I needed to push that

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.710
hard
maybe he only responds to force I don't

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.060
know while I waited to hear back from
Peter's assistant I decided to go to New

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:10.600
York to visit my friend Randy. Alright going up to see Randy. No idea what floor I'm going to. I think it's four.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.920
I was right about the floor.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:28.910
What up Max. This is Randall Poster Randall Poster has worked on over a hundred and thirty

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.630
movies and TV shows as a music
supervisor but what's even more

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.080
impressive is that he's a longtime
collaborator of some of the biggest

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.800
names in American cinema Wes Anderson
Richard Linklater Todd Haynes Harmony

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.120
Korine and Martin Scorsese I figured
Randy must know a thing or two about

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:54.770
what it takes to be a great director do
I need to be a dick to be a good

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.090
director no I don't think you do I don't
think you can be so I don't think you

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:05.680
should be I think that an authentic
personality is really what will attract

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.820
the legions to a director I mean in life
I think it's important that you are true

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:19.970
to who you are and build strength from
that. Here they are the Joseph family.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.640
But who was I?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.760
people come from all sorts of
backgrounds have all sorts of hurdles

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.670
that they've had to overcome and if you
look at yourself like Jesus you know

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.470
I've you know my life has been pretty
smooth going and you know my parents

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.130
borderline they love me too
much where everything you've done has

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:44.260
been like oh my goodness look at that
perfect bowel movement growing up as the

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.850
child of two overly supportive doting
parents didn't exactly breed me to be a

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:54.779
general you're not sure who you are or
you're not coming at people from a true

00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:59.769
place I don't know that you can have the
real insight that you need to manage

00:14:59.769 --> 00:15:03.640
everything because I think the biggest
issue about being a dick when you don't

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.640
want to be a dick for being a
compromiser when you don't want to be a

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:14.560
compromiser is having to sort of live
with this idea of self-deception like I'm

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.149
not being myself I don't think I stand a
chance of becoming that dick general

00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:22.810
leader that we're even talking about I
don't I have a funny feeling that you

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:28.060
can't be that it's not your nature I can't be
that I think I just need to accept the

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:34.230
fact that Here I am at 35 years old a
pussy

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:46.980
okay so right now I am going to meet my
old friend and kind of Mentor since I

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.690
was 15
John Hamburg is the comedic genius

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:56.430
behind I Love You Man Along Came Polly
and the co-writer of Meet the Parents and

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:02.490
Zoolander he's also not a dick so I
figured I'd ask him about his secret to

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.600
how he pulls that off the phrase I came
up with on I Love You Man

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:13.710
was an open-minded control freak that's
what I think I feel it's my job to be

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.940
the most energetic positive person on
the set even if I don't feel that way I

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:23.520
just feel like people feed off the
directors energy I like to invite

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.900
everybody into the process but I think
the more people are kind of in the

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:33.510
filmmakers brain the better work the more invested they are what John

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:38.010
was talking about sounded familiar like
something I read once upon a time in

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:43.860
Aesop's fables
it's a story of the wind and the sun the

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.230
wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger suddenly they saw a

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:54.570
traveler coming down the road
and the son said I see a way to decide

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:59.310
our dispute whichever of us can cause
that traveller to take off his cloak shall

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:04.920
be regarded as the stronger you begin
so the sun retired behind cloud and the

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.990
wind began to blow as hard as it could
upon the traveller but the harder he blew

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:17.459
the more closely did the traveller rack
his cloak around him and the Sun came out

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:23.280
and shone in all of its glory upon the
traveller who soon found it too hot to

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:31.740
walk with his cloak on and took it off
of his own volition and if you do care

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.450
what people think and are open to their
thoughts then something that neither of

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:44.160
you might have imagined could come out
of it Wow that's it that's the secret but

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.240
wasn't this the exact approach that got
me here in the first place sometimes i feel that being

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.540
too polite gets in my way sometimes it can get in your way yeah you yeah I mean that's the

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.580
thing I think that I got better at you
can't as a director hear every point of

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.360
view all day long and allow people to
push you this way or that it happens all

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.940
the time in our business and those
movies suck

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.630
you can tell they were made by committee
do you have to embrace your inner

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:16.140
asshole yes I definitely think you have
to because you you can't please everyone

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.830
I mean that was my point about
people-pleasing and why It's healthy

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.570
in a certain way in terms of like
listening but you do have to be an

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.220
asshole you have to make hard choices
and you do have to call someone out if

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.140
they're not doing their job so hold on
you can be yourself and you can be the

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:40.110
sun but you also have to be a dick
sometimes this was getting confusing how

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:47.130
can I remain kind of the person that I
am but be a better leader I'm sorry max I'm not that kind of psychologist

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:55.580
I don't know if I can help you here Adam Grant is a psychologist a writer a TED
speaker and the youngest tenured

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.050
professor at the Wharton School of
Business when he's not lecturing or

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:04.880
teaching he spends his time advising
companies like Facebook Google Pixar and

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.890
the US Army in his book give and take
adam scientifically disproves the myth

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.850
that nice guys finish last in fact what
he found is that being a giver

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.830
and helping others is what actually
gives you the competitive edge I think

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.700
you're doing something that that I watch
leaders do all the time which is you're

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.860
confusing being a giver versus a taker
with being agreeable or disagreeable so

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.980
giving and taking is about your motives
right what are your intentions toward

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.500
other people do you want to help them
succeed or you're trying to take them

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.370
down whereas being agreeable it's just
about pleasing other people it's about

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.140
having harmony getting along being
highly agreeable as a giver is a curse

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.700
right because you end up becoming like a
pushover right everyone expects you not

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.390
only to listen to them but to implement
all their ideas and you feel very

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.110
uncomfortable saying no because you kind
of built this relationship where no

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.110
matter what right like you're the person
who's smiling who's encouraging is

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.850
nodding my advice to you would be to be
more of a disagreeable Giver which is

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.360
about being gruff and tough on the
surface but underneath having other

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.430
people's best interests at heart

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.510
sometimes in the right moment it makes
sense to withhold a little bit give

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.290
yourself a time to really consider
something where the fact that something

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.020
is like you know I you know you're
making everybody work over the weekend

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:29.060
or you've changed everything where
you've rewritten a scene it's like it

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.200
fucks people's lives up but you know
it's like part of it is like well who

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.610
cares that ruthlessness doesn't
necessarily have to manifest itself in

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:43.880
being a dick it's just resolution there
are definitely times where I feel myself

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:49.160
because I'm quite congenial in everyday
life where I'm like oh I'm kind of for

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.700
me kind of being a dick I think there
are certain things that you work against

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.280
that I've learned to work against in my
nature I can't make everybody happy it's

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.640
never going to be your first nature but
it could become your second nature I was

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.940
starting to find the sweet spot between
being true to my nature

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:14.090
also being enough of a dick to be
effective okay today is a really

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:21.050
important day Pete Berg
Pete Berg has agreed to meet with me

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:28.700
the catch is that I can't bring a camera
and he just wants to meet me bringing my

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:37.970
magic good-luck charm and getaway driver
let's go okay so a change of plan he

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:45.730
just moved the meeting from his office
to his gym shit I'm going to miss my exit

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:53.890
okay so I have arrived at his gym let's go see what Pete has to say.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.410
okay
change of plan Pete has left the gym I'm

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.540
now supposed to meet him at his office
as originally planned that's him

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:26.200
oh my god so I was just at the light and
this Range Rover in front of me was like

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.560
not pulled up enough and I was just
trying to get in the left lane I kind of

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:35.350
honked at it just a little tap honk and
I saw in the rear view mirror

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:40.390
rear view window that it was Pete Berg in
the the Range Rover

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:55.810
I just honked at him oh my god this is
not gonna work out my heart is pounding Alright

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.430
gonna put the camera away

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:06.330
Wow okay I just came out of meeting him
it lasted about like like five minutes

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:12.010
and and he said you know this is a bad
time for me I'm finishing two movies let

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.960
me think about it which is fair and then
as we were leaving he looked at my shirt

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.070
and he said your shirt you should change
your shirt to say we are not your

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:27.820
friends because that's the rule number
one of being in charge is to make

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.120
enemies and he he recommended that I
read a book called the 48 laws of power

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.170
okay real quick the 48 laws of power
which is actually outlawed in the Utah

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:42.570
State Prison system imagines the world
like the classical aristocratic court

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:49.000
think like Queen Elizabeth Louie the
fourteenth or Game of Thrones King does

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.330
not ask he commands a king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls

00:23:55.330 --> 00:24:00.820
You are talking to a king! Some of the laws in the book include never put too much

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.620
trust in friends learn how to use
enemies conceal your intentions court

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.790
attention at all cost get others to do
the work for you but always take the

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.450
credit play on people's need to believe
to create a cult-like preach the need to need for

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.230
change but never reform pose as a friend
work as a spy play to people's

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.840
fantasies act like a king to be treated
like one

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:41.619
it's good to be the king. Crush your enemy totally.

00:24:43.769 --> 00:24:49.330
but something about law number 12 caught
my eye it says open hearted gestures of

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.259
honesty and generosity bring down the
guard of even the most suspicious people

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:59.889
a timely gift a Trojan horse will serve
the same purpose I was going to make a

00:24:59.889 --> 00:25:12.669
gift for Pete Berg. You must be Max.Hello Robert.

00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:17.830
This is Robert Greene author of the 48
laws of power and a really nice guy yeah

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:22.330
I mean like people with me with the 48
laws you know if I sneeze they interpret

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:34.269
it as a Power Move and I get a little
tired and no

00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:40.659
to Peter a man who knows the laws of
power better than anyone I can tell

00:25:40.659 --> 00:25:50.100
you've used that before when you've signed 
books no no I don't think so

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:16.659
okay how about there the gift has been
delivered so now we wait all right he I

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:23.709
just got the email from Pete's assistant
I'm on for an interview at 12:00 p.m. on

00:26:23.709 --> 00:26:28.929
Monday let's not get too excited because
you know I've gotten the interview with

00:26:28.929 --> 00:26:33.339
him before and at the last second
something went wrong so let's I guess

00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:43.900
let's not get our hopes up

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.900
where

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:19.380
check two check check check
check

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.680
so is this just you personally want advice
from me because if it is you don't have to

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.370
pretend you are really making
a movie I'm real okay so I'm really

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.550
making a movie so I've interviewed like
some writers who have written on

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.500
leadership yeah yeah okay that's a good
good score okay it's good good subject

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:41.290
there's like howdy what it how did you
become the leader that you are and what

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:45.670
advice would you have well I mean I
remember my first movie was very bad

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:51.310
things and I was so defiant and
aggressive and vicious when I made that

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.580
film that people come up to me in the
morning they'd be like you know good

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.640
morning I'd be like go fuck yourself what does that mean what the fuck does that mean

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.920
good morning the fuck you talking about
fuck with me you fucking with me

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:09.670
we're just say good morning I think like being

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.630
too nice is a problem you know you
there's such a thing as being too nice

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:19.230
and I I was I probably aired on the
the other side of it but I was so

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:24.550
protective and a lot of that came from
you know fear and insecurity being a

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:28.180
first-time director I'm not really
knowing but there was also this sense of

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.490
like I am NOT going to let anybody fuck
with me right now I'm gonna do this so

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:37.420
where have you on your first movie
you were like mr. aggressive

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:50.200
yeah demand your space yes what has your journey been to a much much more kind of aquanomos spot  I'm very relaxed on set now I'm better

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.580
understanding that everybody's scared
you know and everybody wants to feel

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.780
respected and all those kinds of things
and so

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:04.970
you know I'm much more of like a good
coach than an obsessive lunatic director

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:10.310
like I used to be and it's much more fun
it was around now that I realized that

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:14.660
Pete Berg was a disagreeable Giver
just like the kind Adam grant described

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:19.190
I kind of have a theory that and you
ever play golf

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:24.710
yeah have you ever taken golf lessons so
I've played golf on and off for a long

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:29.360
time and I've taken lots of lessons from
different different golf golf swing

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.070
coaches and I find it amazing every
swing coach you show up they look at

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.940
your swing and they're like oh no that's horrible everything's wrong and of course you're

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.810
doing something you learn from others
they each each swing coach like no that's

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.690
wrong that's wrong that's wrong
everything but the way you're dressing

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.950
the ball the way to holding the club
your weight transfer everything's wrong

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.340
and each guy has his own completely
different theory what's interesting to

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:57.500
look at all these different theories at
the moment of contact they're all pretty

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.000
much at the exact same spot

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.260
and i think that might be a little true for directing

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:16.210
there's a lot of different ways to get
at it and approach it but I think most

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.570
directors are probably some similar
qualities that they all possess probably

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:26.060
the first is is you've got to be a
visionary you have to have a vision you

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.660
know that sounds like a cliche my vision
you know it's not

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.050
you better have a fucking vision you
know and if you don't they're going to

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.710
eat you alive and people confuse that
with being an asshole you look there's a

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:41.390
million ways to have your vision into
and but but you don't have to be angry

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.110
about it you can be quiet and gentle and
like Ron Howard I don't think ever

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:50.090
gotten angry in his life Michael Bay
screams the entire way through they both

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.240
have an idea of what their visions are
though and they're very clear about that

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:58.580
this idea of plurality or that there are
many roads to the temple reminded me of

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:05.000
something dr. Maccoby said you don't
have to be hard you just have to be

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.800
consistent the key is consistency to who
you to your approach if you really know

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.330
what your vision is you

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:26.770
they can't will you go open that door
for a second hey guys can you all shut up

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:31.610
thank you
see that's not I'm not nice

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:38.560
love you so you can do it in a way right?

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:48.570
one question I've kind of asked everyone
is you know there's this famous quote

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:53.190
that I'm starting a movie off with which
is Orson Welles saying a writer needs a

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:59.970
pen a painter needs a brush and a
director needs an army is that true for

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:09.780
you or is there a more ideal metaphor I
think it's um more related for me to the

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:18.450
idea of an architect and her team you
know an architect designs a house but he

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.260
or she doesn't build the roof
necessarily the conductor of an

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:26.420
orchestra is an interesting one and I
have actually thought of that before

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:31.110
because you have artists whether they're
in front of our behind the camera

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.960
they're doing their own thing and
they're there because they're really

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:41.520
good at what they're doing and you want
them all to be in sync I think it's

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:52.470
being a dad being a conductor
being a general but then if it's all

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:59.730
those things without the core of
believing so much in a bigger idea then

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:05.840
it's all empty but it's all just role
playing right at the core of what you're

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:15.600
doing is meaningful to you and you
express that and everyone's on board you

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:23.040
don't have to any of those things so do you have to be a dick to be a great leader well

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.960
the simple answer is no it's just one
approach of many and apparently it's not

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.659
even the most effective
so how do you become a great leader well

00:33:32.659 --> 00:33:37.340
first you've got to accept who you are
maybe you're the sun maybe you're the

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:42.440
wind you could be a complete asshole or
a total pussy you don't really have much

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.450
choice in the matter so best to just
accept your nature and build on it two

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:51.710
have a fucking vision something you
believe in so much and are so passionate

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:56.570
about that it inspires others to be
passionate about it too hopefully it's

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:01.970
not genocide or white nationalism but
that's really up to you and three use

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:06.470
every trick you got every weapon in your
arsenal to realize that vision this

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.770
means however you get the best out of
people how you keep them in rhythm

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:16.700
knowing what each person needs setting
the tone and keeping pace and last but

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:22.369
not least accept the fact that it's
inevitable that you yes even you are

00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:25.629
going to have to be a dick sometimes
