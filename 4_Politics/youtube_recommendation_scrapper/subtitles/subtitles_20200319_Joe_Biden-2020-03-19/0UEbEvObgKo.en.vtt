all who are present and
to all who are watching,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.400
welcome to the Capitol and
to this celebration of our

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.333
great democracy.

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:24.767
Now, this is the 57th
inauguration of an American

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:30.166
president and no matter how many
times one witnesses this event,

00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:34.967
its simplicity, its innate
majesty and, most of all,

00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:40.066
its meaning, that sacred yet
cautious entrusting of power

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:45.233
from we the people to our chosen
leader never fails to make one's

00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:50.667
heart beat faster as it will
today with the inauguration of

00:16:50.667 --> 00:17:02.100
President Barack H. Obama.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.400
Now, we know that we would not
be here today were it not for

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.300
those who stand guard around the
world to preserve our freedom.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.700
To those in our armed forces, we
offer our infinite thanks for

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:36.400
your bravery, your
honor, your sacrifice.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.300
This democracy of ours was
forged by intellect and

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.166
argument, by activism
and blood and, above all,

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:48.767
from John Adams to Elizabeth
Cady Stanton to Martin Luther

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:53.467
King, by a stubborn adherence
to the notion that we are all

00:17:53.467 --> 00:17:57.867
created equal and that we
deserve nothing less than a

00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:01.900
great republic worthy
of our consent.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.800
The theme of this year's
inaugural is faith in

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.333
America's future.

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:11.633
The perfect embodiment to this
unshakable confidence in the

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:15.400
ongoing success of our
collective journey is an event

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.066
from our past.

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:21.266
I speak of the improbable
completion of the Capitol Dome

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:24.700
and capping witness with the
statue of freedom which occurred

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.700
150 years ago in 1863.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.967
When Abraham Lincoln took
office two years earlier,

00:18:32.967 --> 00:18:36.233
the dome above us was
a half-built eyesore.

00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:40.100
Conventional wisdom was that it
should be left unfinished until

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.066
the war ended given the
travails and financial needs

00:18:44.066 --> 00:18:45.633
of the times.

00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:49.467
But to President Lincoln, the
half-finished dome symbolized

00:18:49.467 --> 00:18:51.767
the half-divided nation.

00:18:51.767 --> 00:18:56.133
Lincoln said, "If people
see the Capitol going on,

00:18:56.133 --> 00:19:00.100
"it is a sign we intend
the Union shall go on."

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.433
And, so, despite the conflict
with which engulfed the nation

00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:09.867
and surrounded the city,
the dome continued to rise.

00:19:09.867 --> 00:19:14.834
On December 2, 1863, the
statue of freedom, a woman,

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:18.967
was placed atop the dome
where she still stands today.

00:19:18.967 --> 00:19:23.033
In a sublime irony, it was a
former slave, now free American,

00:19:23.033 --> 00:19:28.233
Philip Reid, who helped
to cast the bronze statue.

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:31.567
Now, our present times are not
as perilous or as despairing as

00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:37.300
they were in 1863, but in 2013
far too many doubt the future of

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.000
this great nation, and our
ability to tackle our own era's

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.033
half-finished domes.

00:19:44.033 --> 00:19:47.000
Today's problems are
intractable they say.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.300
The times are so complex, the
differences in the country and

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.500
the world so deep, we
will never overcome them.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:01.400
When thoughts like these produce
anxiety, fear and even despair,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.467
we do well to remember that
Americans have always been and

00:20:05.467 --> 00:20:09.934
still are a practical,
optimistic,

00:20:09.934 --> 00:20:13.467
problem-solving people, and
that as our history shows,

00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:17.266
no matter how steep the climb,
how difficult the problems,

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:22.066
how half finished that tasks,
America always rises to the

00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:27.767
occasion, America prevails
and America prospers.

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:34.233
(applause)

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:38.133
And those who bet against this
country have inevitably been on

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:40.400
the wrong side of history.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.533
So it is a good moment to gaze
upward and behold the statue of

00:20:46.533 --> 00:20:49.500
freedom at the top
of the Capitol dome.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.166
It is a good moment to gain
strengths and courage and

00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:56.934
humility from those who were
determined to complete the

00:20:56.934 --> 00:20:58.700
half-finished dome.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.533
It is a good moment to rejoice
today at this 57th presidential

00:21:03.533 --> 00:21:05.200
inaugural ceremony.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.867
And it is the perfect moment to
renew our collective faiths (ph)

00:21:09.867 --> 00:21:12.400
in the future of America.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.200
(applause)

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200
Thank you.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.700
And God bless these
United States.

00:21:26.066 --> 00:21:30.367

This is the promise of America.

As we sing the words of
belief, "This Is My Country,"

00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:24.700
let us act upon the meaning
that everyone is included.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.100

inalienable rights of every

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.600
woman, man, boy and
girl be honored.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:40.133
May all your people,
especially the least of these,

00:23:40.133 --> 00:23:44.767
flourish in our blessed nation.

00:23:44.767 --> 00:23:49.734
One hundred-fifty years after
the Emancipation Proclamation

00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:53.834
and 50 years after the
March on Washington,

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:57.400
we celebrate the spirit
of our ancestors,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:03.200
which has allowed us to move
from a nation of unborn hopes

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.633
and a history of
disenfranchised votes,

00:24:07.633 --> 00:24:13.900
to today's expression
of a more perfect union.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:20.900
We ask, too, Almighty, that
where our paths seem blanketed

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:27.600
by throngs of oppression and
riddled by pangs of despair,

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.900
we ask for your guidance toward
the light of deliverance and

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.133
that the vision of those who
came before us and dreamed of

00:24:39.133 --> 00:24:45.667
this day, that we recognize that
their visions still inspire us.

00:24:45.667 --> 00:24:51.000
They are a great cloud of
witnesses unseen by the naked

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.867
eye, but all around us,
thankful that their living was

00:24:57.867 --> 00:25:00.734
not in vain.

00:25:00.734 --> 00:25:06.300
For every mountain, you gave
us the strength to climb.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:12.767
Your grace is pleaded to
continue that climb for America

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:15.100
and the world.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.100
We now stand beneath the shadow
of the nation's capital,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.700
whose golden dome reflects the
unity and democracy of one

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:30.233
nation, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all.

00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:35.200

from where we are assembled,

and women rest in Arlington

fought and died for

00:25:46.567 --> 00:25:48.900
this country.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.700
May their spirit infuse our
being to work together with

00:25:53.700 --> 00:26:00.100
respect, enabling us to
continue to build this nation,

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:05.467
and in so doing we send a
message to the world that we are

00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:13.100
strong, fierce in our strength,
and ever vigilant in our pursuit

00:26:15.033 --> 00:26:20.367

president the will to act

00:26:20.367 --> 00:26:25.433
courageously, but cautiously
when confronted with danger,

00:26:25.433 --> 00:26:30.433
and to act prudently, but
deliberately when challenged

00:26:30.433 --> 00:26:33.066
by adversity.

00:26:33.066 --> 00:26:38.100
Please continue to bless his
efforts to lead by example in

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:45.166

the diversity of our people.

Bless our families all
across this nation.

We thank you for this
opportunity of prayer to

00:26:55.867 --> 00:27:03.367
strengthen us for the journey
through the days that lie ahead.

00:27:03.367 --> 00:27:07.367
We invoke the prayers
of our grandmothers,

00:27:07.367 --> 00:27:09.867
who taught us to pray.

00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:15.300
God, make me a blessing.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:24.166
Let their spirit guide us as
we claim the spirit of old.

00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:30.266
There's something within
me that holds the reins.

00:27:30.266 --> 00:27:35.100
There's something within
me that banishes pain.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.934
There's something within
me I cannot explain.

00:27:39.934 --> 00:27:46.767
But all I know, America --
there is something within.

00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:51.834
There is something within.

00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:56.066
In Jesus' name, in the name
of all who are holy and

00:27:56.066 --> 00:27:58.900
right, we pray.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.100
Amen.

00:33:15.333 --> 00:33:19.934
Senator Schumer:
Please join me in welcoming
my colleague and my friend,

00:33:19.934 --> 00:33:23.734
the Senator from Tennessee,
the Honorable Lamar Alexander.

00:33:23.734 --> 00:33:31.300
(cheers and applause)

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:36.033
Senator Alexander:
Mr. President, Mr. Vice
President, ladies and gentlemen,

00:33:36.033 --> 00:33:39.633
the late Alex Haley,
the author of "Roots,"

00:33:39.633 --> 00:33:43.533
lived his life by
these six words:

00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:47.033
Find the good and praise it.

00:33:47.033 --> 00:33:52.467
Today we praise the American
tradition of transferring,

00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:57.266
or reaffirming immense power
in the inauguration of the

00:33:57.266 --> 00:33:59.800
President of the United States.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.100
We do this in a
peaceful, orderly way.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.700
There is no mob.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.066
No coup.

00:34:07.066 --> 00:34:09.333
No insurrection.

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:14.000
This is a moment when
millions stop and watch.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.800
A moment most of us
always will remember.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.333
It is a moment that is our most
conspicuous and enduring symbol

00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:27.300
of the American Democracy.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.834
How remarkable that this has
survived for so long in such a

00:34:32.834 --> 00:34:37.834
complex country when so
much power is at stake.

00:34:37.834 --> 00:34:40.500
This freedom to vote
for our leaders,

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.300
and the restraint to
respect the results.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:50.266
Last year, at Mount Vernon, a
tour guide told me that our

00:34:50.266 --> 00:34:53.133
first president,
George Washington,

00:34:53.133 --> 00:34:57.433
once posed this question,
"What is most important,"

00:34:57.433 --> 00:35:00.834
Washington asked,
"of this grand experiment,

00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:03.700
"the United States?"

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:08.200
And then Washington answered
his own question in this way,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.767
"Not the election of
the first president,

00:35:10.767 --> 00:35:14.333
"but the election of
its second president.

00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:18.333
"The peaceful transfer of power
is what will separate our

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:22.934
"country from every other
country in the world."

00:35:22.934 --> 00:35:28.767
So today we celebrate the
57th inauguration of the

00:35:28.767 --> 00:35:30.734
American president.

00:35:30.734 --> 00:35:35.100
Find the good and praise it.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.867
Now, it is my honor --

00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:40.433
(applause)

00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:44.500
It is my honor to introduce the
associate justice of the Supreme

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.667
Court, Sonia Sotomayor, for the
purpose of administering the

00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:53.734
Oath of Office to
the Vice President.

00:35:53.734 --> 00:36:00.533
Will everyone please stand?

00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:01.867
Justice Sotomayor:
Thank you, sir.

00:36:01.867 --> 00:36:04.934

00:36:04.934 --> 00:36:06.100

your right hand and repeat

Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief

States Congress, distinguished
guests, and fellow citizens,

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.400
each time we gather to
inaugurate a president,

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.734
we bear witness to the enduring
strength of our Constitution.

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.800
We affirm the promise
of our democracy.

00:43:28.033 --> 00:43:31.066
We recall that what binds
this nation together is not

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:37.033
the colors of our skin or
the tenets of our faith or

00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:39.000
the origins of our names.

00:43:41.367 --> 00:43:47.834
What makes us exceptional,
what makes us America is

00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:51.700
our allegiance to an idea
articulated in a declaration

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:56.900
made more than
two centuries ago.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:02.800
We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.000
are created equal.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.667
(applause)

00:44:08.667 --> 00:44:13.633
That they are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable

00:44:13.633 --> 00:44:21.600
rights, and among these are
life, liberty, and the pursuit

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.600
of happiness.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:31.133
Today we continue a never ending
journey to bridge the meaning of

00:44:31.133 --> 00:44:34.633
those words with the
realities of our time.

00:44:37.233 --> 00:44:40.500
For history tells us that
while these truths may be

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.700
self-evident, they've
never been self-executing.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:50.967
That while freedom is a gift
from God, it must be secured

00:44:50.967 --> 00:44:52.967
by his people here on earth.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.333
The patriots of 1776 did not
fight to replace the tyranny of

00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:06.767
a king with the privileges of
a few, or the rule of a mob.

00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:14.700
They gave to us a republic, a
government of, and by, and for

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.567
the people.

00:45:16.567 --> 00:45:20.000
Entrusting each generation to
keep safe our founding creed.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.266
And for more than
200 years we have.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.600
Through blood drawn by lash, and
blood drawn by sword, we noted

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.266
that no union founded on
the principles of liberty

00:45:35.266 --> 00:45:38.533
and equality could survive
half slave, and half free.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:45.066
We made ourselves anew, and
vowed to move forward together.

00:45:47.433 --> 00:45:49.934
Together we determined that
a modern economy requires

00:45:49.934 --> 00:45:54.266
railroads and highways to speed
travel and commerce, schools and

00:45:54.266 --> 00:45:57.467
colleges to train our workers.

00:45:57.467 --> 00:46:00.700
Together we discovered that a
free market only thrives when

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:05.500
there are rules to ensure
competition and fair play.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.500
Together we resolve that a
great nation must care for

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.533
the vulnerable and protect
its people from life's worst

00:46:13.533 --> 00:46:15.533
hazards and misfortune.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.433
Through it all, we have never
relinquished our skepticism of

00:46:22.433 --> 00:46:26.667
central authority, nor have we
succumbed to the fiction that

00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:30.033
all society's ills can be
cured through government alone.

00:46:32.767 --> 00:46:37.033
Our celebration of initiative
and enterprise, our insistence

00:46:37.033 --> 00:46:40.200
on hard work and personal
responsibility, these are

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.800
constants in our character.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:48.800
For we have always understood
that when times change, so must

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:53.667
we, that fidelity to our
founding principles requires

00:46:53.667 --> 00:46:59.400
new responses to new challenges,
that preserving our individual

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.600
freedoms ultimately
requires collective action.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.600
For the American people can no
more meet the demands of today's

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.400
world by acting alone than
American soldiers could have

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.433
met the forces of fascism
or communism with muskets

00:47:13.433 --> 00:47:16.400
and militias.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.467
No single person can train all
the math and science teachers

00:47:19.467 --> 00:47:23.266
we'll need to equip our
children for the future.

00:47:23.266 --> 00:47:25.300
Or build the roads and
networks and research

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.133
labs that will bring new jobs
and businesses to our shores.

00:47:30.667 --> 00:47:36.266
Now, more than ever, we must
do these things together,

00:47:36.266 --> 00:47:40.200
as one nation, and one people.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:49.000
(applause)

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.834
This generation of Americans
has been tested by crises that

00:47:52.834 --> 00:47:57.100
steeled our resolve and
proved our resilience.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:00.767
A decade of war is now ending.

00:48:00.767 --> 00:48:04.367
(applause)

00:48:04.367 --> 00:48:06.800
And economic recovery has begun.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.467
(applause)

00:48:09.467 --> 00:48:13.367
America's possibilities are
limitless, for we possess all

00:48:13.367 --> 00:48:17.233
the qualities that this world
without boundaries demands:

00:48:17.233 --> 00:48:24.467
youth and drive, diversity and
openness, of endless capacity

00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:29.433
for risk and a gift
for reinvention.

00:48:29.433 --> 00:48:32.433
My fellow Americans, we are
made for this moment and we

00:48:32.433 --> 00:48:35.934
will seize it, so long
as we seize it together.

00:48:35.934 --> 00:48:43.867
(applause)

00:48:43.867 --> 00:48:49.834
For we, the people, understand
that our country cannot succeed

00:48:49.834 --> 00:48:53.567
when a shrinking few do very
well and a growing many barely

00:48:53.567 --> 00:48:54.800
make it.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.600
(applause)

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.400
We believe that America's
prosperity must rest upon

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.633
the broad shoulders of
a rising middle class.

00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:08.767
We know that America thrives
when every person can find

00:49:08.767 --> 00:49:12.800
independence and pride in their
work, when the wages of honest

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.233
labor will liberate families
from the brink of hardship.

00:49:17.667 --> 00:49:20.533
We are true to our creed when
a little girl born into the

00:49:20.533 --> 00:49:23.800
bleakest poverty knows that she
has the same chance to succeed

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.500
as anybody else because she is
an American, she is free, and

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:31.967
she is equal not just in the
eyes of God but also in our own.

00:49:31.967 --> 00:49:39.700
(applause)

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.567
We understand that outworn
programs are inadequate to

00:49:42.567 --> 00:49:45.033
the needs of our time.

00:49:45.033 --> 00:49:48.000
So we must harness new ideas
and technology to remake our

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.400
government, revamp our tax code,
reform our schools, and empower

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.266
our citizens with the skills
they need to work hard or learn

00:49:56.266 --> 00:49:57.934
more, reach higher.

00:49:57.934 --> 00:50:03.934
But while the means will
change, our purpose endures.

00:50:05.934 --> 00:50:09.400
A nation that rewards the effort
and determination of every

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.066
single American, that is
what this moment requires.

00:50:13.066 --> 00:50:20.533
That is what will give
real meaning to our creed.

00:50:20.533 --> 00:50:26.867
We, the people, still believe
that every citizen deserves a

00:50:26.867 --> 00:50:28.867
basic measure of
security and dignity.

00:50:31.567 --> 00:50:34.600
We must make the hard choices
to reduce the cost of health

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.734
care and the size
of our deficit.

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:40.834
(applause)

00:50:40.834 --> 00:50:43.767
But we reject the belief that
America must choose between

00:50:43.767 --> 00:50:47.834
caring for the generation that
built this country and investing

00:50:47.834 --> 00:50:49.800
in the generation that
will build its future.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:56.633
(applause)

00:50:56.633 --> 00:51:00.834
For we remember the lessons of
our past, when twilight years

00:51:00.834 --> 00:51:04.300
were spent in poverty and
parents of a child with a

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.300
disability had nowhere to turn.

00:51:08.033 --> 00:51:11.333
We do not believe that in this
country freedom is reserved for

00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:15.400
the lucky or
happiness for the few.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.667
We recognize that no matter how
responsibly we live our lives,

00:51:19.667 --> 00:51:25.166
any one of us at any time may
face a job loss or a sudden

00:51:25.166 --> 00:51:28.667
illness or a home swept
away in a terrible storm.

00:51:30.934 --> 00:51:34.333
The commitments we make to
each other through Medicare

00:51:34.333 --> 00:51:36.066
and Medicaid and
Social Security,

00:51:36.066 --> 00:51:38.166
these things do not
sap our initiative.

00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:40.266
They strengthen us.

00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:44.233
(applause)

00:51:44.233 --> 00:51:46.700
They do not make us
a nation of takers.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.900
They free us to take the risks
that make this country great.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:57.433
(applause)

00:51:57.433 --> 00:52:02.700
We, the people, still believe
that our obligations as

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:07.734
Americans are not just to
ourselves, but to all posterity.

00:52:10.233 --> 00:52:14.300
We will respond to the threat of
climate change, knowing that the

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.333
failure to do so would
betray our children and

00:52:17.333 --> 00:52:18.467
future generations.

00:52:18.467 --> 00:52:25.367
(applause)

00:52:25.367 --> 00:52:27.467
Some may still deny the
overwhelming judgment of

00:52:27.467 --> 00:52:31.367
science, but none can avoid the
devastating impact of raging

00:52:31.367 --> 00:52:35.834
fires, and crippling drought,
and more powerful storms.

00:52:37.934 --> 00:52:41.767
The path towards sustainable
energy sources will be long

00:52:41.767 --> 00:52:44.333
and sometimes difficult.

00:52:44.333 --> 00:52:47.367
But American cannot
resist this transition.

00:52:47.367 --> 00:52:48.266
We must lead it.

00:52:48.266 --> 00:52:49.500
(applause)

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.166
We cannot cede to other nations
the technology that will power

00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:54.867
new jobs and new industries.

00:52:54.867 --> 00:52:58.633
We must claim its promise.

00:52:58.633 --> 00:53:01.500
That's how we will maintain
our economic vitality and our

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:07.700
national treasure, our forests
and waterways, our crop lands

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.367
and snowcapped peaks.

00:53:10.367 --> 00:53:14.066
That is how we will preserve
our planet, commanded to our

00:53:14.066 --> 00:53:16.700
care by God.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.734
That's what will lend
meaning to the creed our

00:53:19.734 --> 00:53:21.734
fathers once declared.

00:53:24.633 --> 00:53:30.967
We, the people, still believe
that enduring security and

00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:35.066
lasting peace do not
require perpetual war.

00:53:35.066 --> 00:53:41.700
(applause)

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:46.133
Our brave men and women in
uniform tempered by the flames

00:53:46.133 --> 00:53:49.066
of battle are unmatched
in skill and courage.

00:53:49.066 --> 00:53:51.834
(applause)

00:53:51.834 --> 00:53:56.500
Our citizens seared by the
memory of those we have lost,

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.600
know too well the price
that is paid for liberty.

00:54:01.567 --> 00:54:04.567
The knowledge of their sacrifice
will keep us forever vigilant

00:54:04.567 --> 00:54:06.567
against those who
would do us harm.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.500
But we are also heirs to those
who won the peace, and not just

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:16.000
the war; who turn sworn enemies
into the surest of friends.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.967
And we must carry those
lessons into this time as well.

00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:24.300
We will defend our people,
and uphold our values through

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.533
strength of arms,
and the rule of law.

00:54:28.734 --> 00:54:31.600
We will show the courage to try
and resolve our differences with

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.200
other nations peacefully.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.200
Not because we are naive about
the dangers we face, but because

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.767
engagement can more durably
lift suspicion and fear.

00:54:40.767 --> 00:54:45.200
(applause)

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.300
America will remain the anchor
of strong alliances in every

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:49.300
corner of the globe.

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.700
And we will renew those
institutions that extend

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.367
our capacity to
manage crisis abroad.

00:54:55.367 --> 00:54:58.600
For no one has a greater stake
in a peaceful world than its

00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.667
most powerful nation.

00:54:59.667 --> 00:55:04.433
We will support democracy
from Asia to Africa, from the

00:55:04.433 --> 00:55:07.367
Americas to the Middle East,
because our interests and our

00:55:07.367 --> 00:55:11.066
conscience compel us to act
on behalf of those who long

00:55:11.066 --> 00:55:12.734
for freedom.

00:55:12.734 --> 00:55:18.433
And we must be a source of
hope to the poor, the sick,

00:55:18.433 --> 00:55:22.333
the marginalized, the
victims of prejudice.

00:55:22.333 --> 00:55:25.934
Not out of mere charity, but
because peace in our time

00:55:25.934 --> 00:55:29.066
requires the constant advance
of those principles that our

00:55:29.066 --> 00:55:34.800
common creed describes;
tolerance and opportunity,

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.400
human dignity and justice.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:48.900
We, the people, declare today
that the most evident of truths

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:53.467
that all of us are created equal
-- is the star that guides us

00:55:53.467 --> 00:55:58.100
still; just as it guided our
forebears through Seneca Falls

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:02.033
and Selma and Stonewall; just
as it guided all those men and

00:56:02.033 --> 00:56:05.800
women, sung and unsung, who
left footprints along this great

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:10.533
mall, to hear a preacher say
that we cannot walk alone; to

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:13.800
hear a King proclaim that
our individual freedom is

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.633
inextricably bound to the
freedom of every soul on Earth.

00:56:17.633 --> 00:56:25.200
(applause)

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:30.633
It is now our generation's task
to carry on what those pioneers

00:56:30.633 --> 00:56:35.867
began, for our journey is not
complete until our wives, our

00:56:35.867 --> 00:56:39.433
mothers and daughters can earn
a living equal to their efforts.

00:56:39.433 --> 00:56:45.600
(applause)

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.967
Our journey is not complete
until our gay brothers and

00:56:47.967 --> 00:56:53.333
sisters are treated like anyone
else under the law, for if we

00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:56.633
are truly created equal, then
surely the love we commit to one

00:56:56.633 --> 00:56:59.200
another must be equal, as well.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:04.066
(applause)

00:57:04.066 --> 00:57:06.500
Our journey is not complete
until no citizen is forced

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.133
to wait for hours to
exercise the right to vote.

00:57:09.133 --> 00:57:13.667
(applause)

00:57:13.667 --> 00:57:16.567
Our journey is not complete
until we find a better way to

00:57:16.567 --> 00:57:20.500
welcome the striving, hopeful
immigrants who still see America

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.934
as a land of opportunity,
until bright young students

00:57:23.934 --> 00:57:27.033
and engineers are enlisted
in our workforce rather than

00:57:27.033 --> 00:57:28.900
expelled from our country.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:34.467
(applause)

00:57:34.467 --> 00:57:39.033
Our journey is not complete
until all our children, from the

00:57:39.033 --> 00:57:42.667
streets of Detroit to the hills
of Appalachia to the quiet lanes

00:57:42.667 --> 00:57:48.133
of Newtown, know that they
are cared for and cherished

00:57:48.133 --> 00:57:50.667
and always safe from harm.

00:57:54.266 --> 00:58:00.200
That is our generation's task,
to make these works, these

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:05.700
rights, these values of life
and liberty and the pursuit

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.433
of happiness real
for every American.

00:58:12.734 --> 00:58:15.500
Being true to our founding
documents does not require

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:20.300
us to agree on every
contour of life.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:25.467
It does not mean we all define
liberty in exactly the same way

00:58:25.467 --> 00:58:28.567
or follow the same
precise path to happiness.

00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:34.567
Progress does not compel us to
settle century's long debates

00:58:34.567 --> 00:58:39.367
about the role of government for
all time, but it does require us

00:58:39.367 --> 00:58:42.200
to act in our time.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:47.734
(applause)

00:58:47.734 --> 00:58:53.900
For now, decisions are upon
us and we cannot afford delay.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:58.100
We cannot mistake absolutism
for principle or substitute

00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:03.533
spectacle for politics, or treat
name-calling as reasoned debate.

00:59:03.533 --> 00:59:06.967
(applause)

00:59:06.967 --> 00:59:10.400
We must act.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:15.233
We must act knowing that
our work will be imperfect.

00:59:15.233 --> 00:59:19.433
We must act knowing that today's
victories will be only partial,

00:59:19.433 --> 00:59:23.166
and that it will be up to those
who stand here in four years and

00:59:23.166 --> 00:59:27.867
40 years and 400 years hence
to advance the timeless spirit

00:59:27.867 --> 00:59:31.133
once conferred to us in a
spare Philadelphia hall.

00:59:36.934 --> 00:59:44.467
My fellow Americans, the oath
I have sworn before you today,

00:59:44.467 --> 00:59:49.166
like the one recited by others
who serve in this Capitol,

00:59:49.166 --> 00:59:55.700
was an oath to God and country,
not party or faction.

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.967
And we must faithfully execute
that pledge during the duration

00:59:58.967 --> 01:00:00.967
of our service.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:06.100
But the words I spoke today are
not so different from the oath

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.967
that is taken each time a
soldier signs up for duty,

01:00:09.967 --> 01:00:11.967
or an immigrant
realizes her dream.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.333
My oath is not so different from
the pledge we all make to the

01:00:17.333 --> 01:00:20.600
flag that waves above and that
fills our hearts with pride.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.667
They are the words of
citizens, and they represent

01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:29.266
our greatest hope.

01:00:29.266 --> 01:00:32.300
You and I, as citizens,
have the power to set

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.266
this country's course.

01:00:35.266 --> 01:00:39.900
You and I, as citizens, have the
obligation to shape the debates

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.600
of our time, not only with the
votes we cast, but the voices

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.700
we lift in defense of our
most ancient values and

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.967
enduring ideals.

01:00:47.967 --> 01:00:50.367
(applause)

01:00:50.367 --> 01:00:55.734
Let us each of us now embrace
with solemn duty, and awesome

01:00:55.734 --> 01:01:00.066
joy, what is our
lasting birthright.

01:01:00.066 --> 01:01:04.367
With common effort and common
purpose, with passion and

01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:09.400
dedication, let us answer the
call of history and carry into

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.800
an uncertain future that
precious light of freedom.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.800
Thank you. God bless you.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.934
And may He forever bless these
United States of America.

01:01:17.934 --> 01:02:00.367
(cheers and applause)

01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:15.533
Senator Schumer:

Senator Schumer:
Wow.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.166
(laughter)

01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:59.166
Our next distinguished guest
is the poet Richard Blanco,

01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:04.100
who will share with us words he
has composed for this occasion.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:15.467
(applause)

01:06:30.567 --> 01:06:39.367
Richard Blanco:
Mr. President, Mr. Vice
President, America, "One Today."

01:06:41.467 --> 01:06:46.834
One sun rose on us today,
kindled over our shores,

01:06:46.834 --> 01:06:50.834
peeking over the Smokies,
greeting the faces of the

01:06:50.834 --> 01:06:57.367
Great Lakes, spreading a simple
truth across the Great Plains,

01:06:57.367 --> 01:07:01.233
then charging
across the Rockies.

01:07:01.233 --> 01:07:08.633
One light, waking up rooftops,
under each one, a story told by

01:07:08.633 --> 01:07:13.800
our silent gestures
moving behind windows.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:21.433
My face, your face, millions
of faces in morning's mirrors,

01:07:21.433 --> 01:07:27.734
each one yawning to life,
crescendoing into our day --

01:07:27.734 --> 01:07:32.100
pencil-yellow school buses,
the rhythm of traffic lights,

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.667
fruit stands-- apples,
limes, and oranges arrayed

01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:41.033
like rainbows
begging our praise.

01:07:41.033 --> 01:07:46.700
Silver trucks heavy with oil
or paper -- bricks or milk,

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:54.567
teeming over highways alongside
us, on our way to clean tables,

01:07:54.567 --> 01:08:01.633
read ledgers, or save lives --
to teach geometry, or ring up

01:08:01.633 --> 01:08:08.333
groceries as my mother did for
twenty years, so I could write

01:08:08.333 --> 01:08:10.333
this poem.

01:08:13.934 --> 01:08:19.934
All of us as vital as the one
light we move through, the same

01:08:19.934 --> 01:08:24.633
light on blackboards with
lessons for the day -- equations

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:30.867
to solve, history to question,
or atoms imagined, the "I have a

01:08:30.867 --> 01:08:38.700
dream" we keep dreaming, or the
impossible vocabulary of sorrow

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:44.934
that won't explain the empty
desks of twenty children marked

01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:48.367
absent today, and forever.

01:08:50.567 --> 01:08:56.567
Many prayers, but one light
breathing color into stained

01:08:56.567 --> 01:09:02.300
glass windows, life into the
faces of bronze statues, warmth

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.600
onto the steps of our museums
and park benches as mothers

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.867
watch children
slide into the day.

01:09:10.867 --> 01:09:13.333
One ground.

01:09:13.333 --> 01:09:18.867
Our ground, rooting us to every
stalk of corn, every head of

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:24.834
wheat sown by sweat and hands,
hands gleaning coal or planting

01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:29.000
windmills in deserts and
hilltops that keep us warm,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.200
hands digging trenches, routing
pipes and cables, hands as worn

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.467
as my father's cutting sugarcane
so my brother and I could have

01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:42.667
books and shoes.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:51.934
The dust of farms and deserts,
cities and plains mingled by

01:09:51.934 --> 01:09:58.633
one wind -- our breath.

01:09:58.633 --> 01:10:01.300
Breathe.

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.066
Hear it through the day's
gorgeous din of honking cabs,

01:10:05.066 --> 01:10:09.233
buses launching down avenues,
the symphony of footsteps,

01:10:09.233 --> 01:10:14.100
guitars, and screeching subways,
the unexpected song bird on your

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.100
clothes line.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.900
Hear: squeaky playground swings,
trains whistling, or whispers

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:27.667
across café tables, Hear: the
doors we open for each other all

01:10:27.667 --> 01:10:38.467
day, saying: hello, shalom,
buon giorno, howdy, namaste, or

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:43.934
buenos días in the language my
mother taught me -- in every

01:10:43.934 --> 01:10:49.000
language spoken into one wind
carrying our lives without

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.734
prejudice, as these
words break from my lips.

01:10:55.734 --> 01:11:00.500
One sky: since the Appalachians
and Sierras claimed their

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:05.166
majesty, and the Mississippi
and Colorado worked their way

01:11:05.166 --> 01:11:07.800
to the sea.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:13.266
Thank the work of our hands:
weaving steel into bridges,

01:11:13.266 --> 01:11:18.033
finishing one more report for
the boss on time, stitching

01:11:18.033 --> 01:11:22.700
another wound or uniform,
the first brush stroke on

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.867
a portrait, or the last floor on
the Freedom Tower jutting into a

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:32.867
sky that yields
to our resilience.

01:11:32.867 --> 01:11:38.467
One sky, toward which we
sometimes lift our eyes tired

01:11:38.467 --> 01:11:46.033
from work: some days guessing at
the weather of our lives, some

01:11:46.033 --> 01:11:52.700
days giving thanks for a love
that loves you back, sometimes

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:59.066
praising a mother who knew how
to give, or forgiving a father

01:11:59.066 --> 01:12:01.133
who couldn't give
what you wanted.

01:12:03.867 --> 01:12:10.934
We head home: through the gloss
of rain or weight of snow, or

01:12:10.934 --> 01:12:18.300
the plum blush of dusk,
but always -- always home,

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:23.900
always under one sky, our sky.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:29.133
And always one moon like a
silent drum tapping on every

01:12:29.133 --> 01:12:34.567
rooftop and every window, of
one country -- all of us --

01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:42.967
facing the stars hope -- a new
constellation waiting for us to

01:12:42.967 --> 01:12:48.500
map it, waiting for us
to name it -- together.

01:12:51.333 --> 01:13:09.333
(applause)

01:13:09.333 --> 01:13:13.200
Senator Scumer:
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
now my privilege to introduce

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.867
Reverend Dr. Luis León to
deliver the benediction.

01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:37.133
Reverend Dr. Luis León:
Let us pray:

01:13:40.066 --> 01:13:44.133
Gracious and eternal
God, as we conclude the

01:13:44.133 --> 01:13:49.200
second inauguration of President
Obama, we ask for your blessings

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.967
as we seek to become, in the
words of Martin Luther King,

01:13:53.967 --> 01:13:58.166
citizens of a beloved community,
loving you and loving our

01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:00.233
neighbors as ourselves.

01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:06.667
We pray that you will bless us
with your continued presence

01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:09.200
because without it,
hatred and arrogance

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.867
will infect our hearts.

01:14:11.867 --> 01:14:15.633
But with your blessing we know
that we can break down the walls

01:14:15.633 --> 01:14:17.633
that separate us.

01:14:18.734 --> 01:14:23.300
We pray for your blessing today
because without it, distrust,

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:27.567
prejudice and rancor
will rule our hearts.

01:14:27.567 --> 01:14:31.533
But with the blessing of your
presence, we know that we can

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:35.100
renew the ties of mutual
regard which can best form

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.066
our civic life.

01:14:38.467 --> 01:14:42.000
We pray for your blessing
because without it suspicion,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.367
despair, and fear of those
different from us will be our

01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:49.166
rule of life.

01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:53.700
But with your blessing, we can
see each other created in your

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:59.700
image, a unit of God's grace,
unprecedented, irrepeatable

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.767
and irreplaceable.

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:08.600
We pray for your blessing
because without it,

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.033
we will see only
what the eye can see.

01:15:12.033 --> 01:15:15.500
But with the blessing of your
blessing we will see that we are

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:21.633
created in your image, whether
brown, black or white, male or

01:15:21.633 --> 01:15:27.000
female, first generation or
immigrant American, or daughter

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.400
of the American Revolution,
gay or straight, rich or poor.

01:15:34.533 --> 01:15:37.967
We pray for your blessing
because without it, we will

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:42.166
only see scarcity in
the midst of abundance.

01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:46.333
But with your blessing we will
recognize the abundance of the

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.000
gifts of this good
land with which you

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
have endowed this nation.

01:15:53.266 --> 01:15:55.667
We pray for your blessing.

01:15:55.667 --> 01:15:59.900
Bless all of us, privileged to
be citizens and residents of

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:04.500
this nation, with a spirit of
gratitude and humility that we

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.467
may become a blessing among
the nations of this world.

01:16:09.767 --> 01:16:14.100
We pray that you will shower
with your life-giving spirit,

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:19.000
the elected leaders of this
land, especially Barack our

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.567
president and Joe
our vice president.

01:16:23.533 --> 01:16:26.834
Fill them with a love of truth
and righteousness, that they may

01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:30.166
serve this nation ably and
be glad to do your will.

01:16:32.433 --> 01:16:36.734
Endow their hearts with wisdom
and forbearance, so that peace

01:16:36.734 --> 01:16:41.467
may prevail with righteousness,
justice with order, so that men

01:16:41.467 --> 01:16:45.266
and women throughout this nation
can find with one another the

01:16:45.266 --> 01:16:47.266
fulfillment of our humanity.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.800
We pray that the president, vice
president and all in political

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.900
authority will remember the
words of the prophet Micah,

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:02.867
