00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.550
There’s a two-letter word that we hear everywhere.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.720
OK.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.820
Okay.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.880
OK, are you OK Annie?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.460
OK OK OK, OK ladies…

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.440
OK might be the most recognizable word on
the planet.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.450
OK!

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.450
OK.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.280
It’s essential to how we communicate with
each other, and even with our technology.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.240
Alexa, turn off the living room light.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.240
OK.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.450
You probably use it every day – even if
you don’t notice it.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.369
But, what does OK actually mean?

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.079
And where did it come from?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.079
Hm.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.079
OK.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.079
Okay then.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.979
OK, thank you.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:42.510
OK actually traces back to an 1830s fad of
intentionally misspelling abbreviations.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.210
Young “intellectual” types in Boston delighted
those “in the know” with butchered coded

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.429
messages such as KC, or “knuff ced”, KY,
“know yuse,” and OW, “oll wright.”

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:56.429
Haha.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:03.660
But thanks to a couple of lucky breaks, one
abbreviation rose above the rest: OK, or “oll korrect."

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.140
In the early 1800s, “all correct” was
a common phrase used to confirm that everything

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.260
was in order.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.030
Its abbreviated cousin started going mainstream
on March 23, 1839, when OK was first published

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.750
in the Boston Morning Post.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.610
Soon other papers picked up on the joke and
spread it around the country, until OK was

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.820
something everyone knew about, not just a
few Boston insiders.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.880
And OK’s newfound popularity even prompted
a flailing US president from Kinderhook, New York,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.700
to adopt it as a nickname during his
1840 reelection campaign.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.780
Van Buren’s supporters formed OK Clubs all
over the country, and their message was pretty

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.690
clear: Old Kinderhook was “oll korrect.”

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.630
The campaign was highly publicized and turned
pretty nasty in the press.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.380
His opponents ended up turning the abbreviation
around on him, saying it stood for “Orful

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.900
Konspiracy” or “Orful Katastrophe”

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.640
Hah.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.120
In the end, even a clever nickname didn’t
save Van Buren’s presidency.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.850
But it was a win for OK.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.550
That 1840 presidential campaign firmly established
OK in the American vernacular.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.959
And while similar abbreviations fell out of
fashion, OK made the crossover from slang

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.220
into legitimate, functional use thanks to
one invention: the telegraph.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.400
If we lower the bridge, the current flows
to the sounder.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.620
At the other end, the current energizes an
electromagnet and this attracts the armature.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.760
The armature clicks down against a screw and
taps out a message.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.450
The telegraph debuted in 1844, just five years
after OK.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.610
It transmitted short messages in the form
of electric pulses, with combinations of dots

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.550
and dashes representing letters of the alphabet.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.420
This was OK’s moment to shine.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.780
The two letters were easy to tap out and very
unlikely to be confused with anything else.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.409
It was quickly adopted as a standard acknowledgement
of a transmission received, especially by

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.980
operators on the expanding US railroad.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.969
This telegraphic manual from 1865 even goes
as far as to say that “no message is ever

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.190
regarded as transmitted until the office receiving
it gives O K.”

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.020
OK had become serious business.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.739
But there’s another big reason the two letters
stuck around, and it’s not just because

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.900
they’re easy to communicate.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.969
It has to do with how OK looks.

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.769
Or more specifically, how the letter K looks
and sounds.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.939
It’s really uncommon to start a word with
the letter K in English — it’s ranked

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.080
around 22nd in the alphabet.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.239
That rarity spurred a “Kraze for K” at
the turn of the century in advertising and

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.299
print, where companies replaced hard Cs with
Ks in order to Katch your eye.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.419
The idea was that modifying a word — like
Klearflax Linen Rugs or this Kook-Rite Stove,

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.310
for example — would draw more attention
to it.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.169
And that’s still a visual strategy: We see
K represented in modern corporate logos, like

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.160
Krispy-Kreme and Kool-Aid.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.980
It’s the K that makes it so memorable.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.400
By the 1890s, OK’s Bostonian origins were
already mostly forgotten, and newspapers began

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.749
to debate its history — often perpetuating
myths in the process that some people still

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:00.749
believe.

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:05.050
Like the claim that it comes from the Choctaw
word ‘okeh,’ which means ‘so it is.’

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.769
Choctaw gave us the word OK…

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.340
OK’s beginnings had become obscure but it
didn’t really matter anymore — the word

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.950
was embedded in our language.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.310
Today, we use it as the ultimate “neutral
affirmative.”

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.310
OK then.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.500
Okay then.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.070
Learn to truly love yourself.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.070
OK.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.560
OK.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560
Get yourself up here!

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760
OK!

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.160
I don’t know what to say.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.600
Say OK.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.160
OK.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.030
It’s settled then!

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.910
Allan Metcalf wrote the definitive history
of OK, and he explains that the word “affirms

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.730
without evaluating,” meaning it doesn’t
convey any feelings — it just acknowledges

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.960
and accepts information.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.080
If you “got home OK,” it just means you
were unharmed.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.670
If your “food was OK,” then it was acceptable.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.610
And “OK” confirms a change of plans.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.950
It’s is sort of a reflex at this point — we
don’t even keep track of how much we use

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.440
it.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.660
Which might be why OK was arguably the first
word spoken when humans landed on the moon.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.640
Not bad for a corny joke from the 1830s.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.020
Alright guys, cut it out.
