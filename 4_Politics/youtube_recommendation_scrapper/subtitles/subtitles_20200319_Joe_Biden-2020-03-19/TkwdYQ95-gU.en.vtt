00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
we're saying if you don't have symptoms
 

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.909 align:start position:0%
we're saying if you don't have symptoms
don't<00:31:20.760><c> go</c><00:31:21.029><c> and</c><00:31:21.840><c> that's</c><00:31:22.350><c> why</c><00:31:22.500><c> I</c><00:31:22.529><c> put</c><00:31:22.710><c> out</c><00:31:22.799><c> this</c>

00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
don't go and that's why I put out this
 

00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
don't go and that's why I put out this
self-assessment<00:31:23.340><c> tool</c><00:31:23.820><c> and</c><00:31:24.019><c> so</c><00:31:25.019><c> we're</c><00:31:25.289><c> making</c>

00:31:25.399 --> 00:31:25.409 align:start position:0%
self-assessment tool and so we're making
 

00:31:25.409 --> 00:31:27.620 align:start position:0%
self-assessment tool and so we're making

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:27.630 align:start position:0%
sure that doesn't get overloaded and so
 

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.149 align:start position:0%
sure that doesn't get overloaded and so
I<00:31:27.659><c> think</c><00:31:27.779><c> from</c><00:31:28.139><c> the</c><00:31:28.320><c> early</c><00:31:28.559><c> data</c><00:31:28.710><c> we're</c><00:31:28.919><c> seeing</c>

00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
I think from the early data we're seeing
 

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:33.409 align:start position:0%
I think from the early data we're seeing
that<00:31:29.760><c> has</c><00:31:30.000><c> reduced</c><00:31:30.230><c> the</c><00:31:31.230><c> I</c><00:31:31.950><c> think</c><00:31:32.820><c> a</c><00:31:33.179><c> good</c>

00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
that has reduced the I think a good

that has reduced the I think a good

00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
amount the IDI visits so that's
 

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:37.850 align:start position:0%
amount the IDI visits so that's
reassuring<00:31:35.940><c> so</c><00:31:36.779><c> it</c><00:31:36.870><c> gives</c><00:31:37.019><c> us</c><00:31:37.110><c> that</c><00:31:37.169><c> greater</c>

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
