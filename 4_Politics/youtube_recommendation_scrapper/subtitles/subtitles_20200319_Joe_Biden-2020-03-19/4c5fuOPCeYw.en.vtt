00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
In 1987, Senator Joe Biden was 
running for President.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.848
Then, one of his rivals leaked a video of
him repeating a speech

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:11.600
from a British politician as his own:

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.430
The first Kinnock
I’m the first Biden

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.270
in a thousand generations
to be able to get to university

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.140
to get to a college and graduate degree

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.400
Biden dropped out and went back to DC, where

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.250
he was chair of the Senate Judiciary committee.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.570
He offered to step down.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.500
Here’s how he describes what happened next.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.530
"'Absolutely not,’ Sen. Strom Thurmond said.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.900
‘You’re my chairman.’"

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.690
Strom Thurmond wasn't just a Republican - he
was a segregationist.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.620
But he and Biden became friends.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.220
Biden’s long career in the Senate was built

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.250
on personal relationships like this.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.070
Now, he’s running for President again.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.950
This time, he’s running on the belief that’s
defined his political career: That consensus

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.890
isn’t just possible, it’s preferable.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.310
People are saying, ‘Biden just doesn’t
get it, You can’t work with Republicans

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.310
anymore.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.310
That’s not the way it works anymore.’

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.340
Well, folks, I know how to make government
work.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.840
It’s a promise rooted in Biden’s vision
of how things once were.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.869
I’ve worked across the aisle in the past.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.259
I can do that again with your help.

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.609
He's a person who represents a nostalgic
version of politics.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.350
Biden represents what we want to believe is
the past.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.819
Joe Biden believes he can take us back to
a time before partisan gridlock.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.279
The question is, should we give him the chance?

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:41.020
What's the best case for President Joe Biden?

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.689
I've met Joe Biden and I admit it's kind of
enchanting.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.979
He's a gladhander. He'll make you smile.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.200
He'll make you laugh.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.320
People feel like he cares and he has empathy.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.520
That is one of Biden's sort of strengths.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.779
His primary opponents have criticized Biden
for being too moderate.

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.149
You think he’s too moderate?

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.819
He might be too moderate for me and for the
party.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.780
I think if you're looking through his policies, what you're gonna see is that

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.470
despite the rhetoric of him being a moderate candidate,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.320
in a sort of bigger picture way
he's definitely still a progressive.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.700
Biden wants to triple the Child Tax Credit
from $2,000 a year to $6,000.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.280
He’s been championing free college since
2015.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.250
And supports a $15 minimum wage.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.580
Plus, he wants to make it easier for workers
to know how much their co-workers are making,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.500
to help fight against pay disparities.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.390
If Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders weren't
there, I think the headlines would be

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.320
"Joe Biden is running on the most progressive policy
platform in American history."

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.040
At the same time, Biden has built a persona
as a moderate deal-maker.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.420
Back in 2009, during the financial
crisis, Biden helped convince three moderate

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.320
Republican Senators to cross the aisle and
vote for a stimulus bill

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.100
That helped stabilize the economy

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.980
by increasing investment in highways and programs like food stamps

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.140
He's going to take a deal, is going to take
a bargain because he believes that that's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.600
what's going to make people's lives better.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.120
And the case for him as a candidate rests
on where that reputation can help him the most.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.280
I will win Michigan.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.280
I promise you that.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.120
I will win Pennsylvania.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.150
I will win Ohio.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.400
All of the Democratic candidates beat Trump
nationwide, all of them.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.530
But that's not how you win.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.740
So in the United States, you have to win not
only a lot of votes, but you have to win in

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.120
a lot of places.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.620
And that's what Donald Trump did.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.700
So he beat Hillary Clinton with fewer votes,
but he won in key places.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.640
Some of these key places Democrats have won
before.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.640
Barack Obama won them.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.040
The state of Pennsylvania went for Obama...

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.860
But then Donald Trump came in

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.680
and he carried a specific district right outside
of Pittsburgh by 20 points.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.380
American politics usually comes down to, you
know, 10 points is a landslide.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.260
Five points is like a sweeping victory.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.720
So 20 points is a knockout race.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.420
A year and a half later,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.990
there was a special election that came up.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.880
The Republican incumbent had aligned himself
closely with President Trump.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.300
And he faced a challenge from a young Democrat.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.760
I’m Conor Lamb, and I approve this message.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.030
They were running a campaign of localized
politics, moderate politics, appealing to

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.030
union workers.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.300
They worked hard for it and they expect us
to keep our promises to them.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.779
His campaign only paused for one national
Democrat.

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.930
Former vice president Joe Biden.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.250
Go out and make sure he wins!

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.740
Conor Lamb won that race.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.400
And a few months later, a similar strategy
helped Democrats

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.979
win back the House of Representatives.

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.449
Of the 41 seats that Democrats flipped from
Republican incumbents in 2018, just a handful

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.210
went to members of the House Progressive caucus.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.310
The rest ran on more moderate platforms.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.060
It was a lot of just competent women.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.020
A lot of them came from military backgrounds,
policing backgrounds.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.939
And were running on, hey, I'm gonna make sure
healthcare stays strong.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:09.340
I'm going to protect the ACA.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.039
Two years later, that sounds a lot like the
kind of campaign Joe Biden is running.

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.779
I believe we have to protect and build on
Obamacare.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.259
That’s why I proposed adding a public option
to Obamacare

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.960
as the best way to lower cost and cover
everyone.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.560
Joe Biden has a case to make, a very strong
case that he can go into places where Democrats

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.479
have lost and he can win.

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.719
He has a reputation for connecting with voters,
for being a really great campaigner.

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.689
And it's not just that he's good at those
things, but it's that those things matter

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.740
in the places that Democrats really need to
win.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.099
If you're looking at Democrats, it's worth
considering.

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.229
Who whose political strategy do you like the
best and do you think will get the most done?
