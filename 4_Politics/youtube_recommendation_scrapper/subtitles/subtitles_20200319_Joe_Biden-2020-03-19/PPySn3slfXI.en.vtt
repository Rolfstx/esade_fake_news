00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.389
It's not until the very last moment that those sparks tell me what [but] on Earth they machine

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.990
I've never encountered anyone like this

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.750
He absolutely blew my mind

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.009
To scientists this man is a gold mine a once-in-A-lifetime opportunity

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.768
This could be the linchpin that spawns off a new field of research

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.549
Why are they all so excited genius? It's not even

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.949
Daniel Tammet claims that since he was four years old. He's been able to do huge calculations in his head, [so]

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.899
[in] august 2002 we dropped by armed with a calculator

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.459
And you can't see this calculator that I've got here. Can you?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.410
We first asked Daniel to multiply 37 by itself four times

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.599
okay, okay five [seven] to the power 4 um

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500
1 1 million yeah

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.650
[870]

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.050
[4160] [One] Amazing

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.509
Just to make sure that people say well perhaps

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.010
You just know a few [of] these off by heart [let] me just choose another one next we asked them to divide 13 by 97

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.669
Low point one three four zero two

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.620
zero six

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.230
That's as far as my calculator. Go friend one eight five eight

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900
five six seven

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.919
You're carrying on [going] on to me to stop off how many points can you do it?

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.200
[100] million

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.890
At this point we borrowed a computer that gave us the answer to 32 decimal places

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.800
Okay, no point

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.800
one three four zero two

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.459
zero six one eight

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.700
five

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.370
five six seven

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.610
As he went on every single number was correct?

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.699
And he even surpassed the computer

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.680
for

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680
six

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.090
three

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.929
Nine one seven five two five you've reached the end of the computers all 100%

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.610
Amazing when you're pointing to the table and doing shapes with your fingers what what's going on?

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.600
And I'm seeing the numbers, but I'm not see

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.469
Straight I'm seeing pictures shapes and patterns

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.930
Almost like a square that the texture of order drops Ripples almost that's something reflective

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.379
It's somebody can look [through] almost on italic and Ilana was it a hard clown a bit like a flash

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
It sounds preposterous

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.189
But if it's true it blows away scientific theory

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.809
Daniels Brain seems to be doing something almost magical it appears to be doing maths without him actually having to think

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.660
As if this wasn't enough Daniel is also a wizard with words

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.539
Para [Colossal] Katya Katya Luscious velvety Meniscus

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.400
And he knows nine languages and says he could learn to speak [anyone] just a week

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.469
How can daniel do such enormous calculations [instead] and is it really possible to [learn] the language in just seven days

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.129
I'm currently a freelance tutor [Daniel] has agreed to be tested by scientists

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.770
And will also be calling his bluff

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.510
Without warning, we'll give him a week to master a totally new language before going live on National television

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.240
Kamala know me too dirty

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.949
But our journey begins in Oxford in

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.909
March 2004 Daniel took us by surprise

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.550
with a dazzling memory stunt

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.409
the ambition is to remember [pie] to

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.640
22,500 decimal places and

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.609
To recite it in [the] live environment

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.030
with a vigil [eaters] who will be checking and

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.800
Making sure obviously that the recitation is collect from start to finish

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.440
Pi is the circumference of a circle

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.800
divided by its diameter

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.239
It's a number with no pattern that seems to be in food

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.619
Daniel Reckon he could reel off the first 22 and a half thousand decimal places without [a] mistake

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.900

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.289
[six-eight] two hours later and Daniel is barely Halfway

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:31.200
Absolutely staggering, it's a beautiful to listen to [the] flower numbers. It's beautiful to see the concentration

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.149
It's always amazing to be in front of one of the world's extraordinary persons

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.629
Three nine nine five two zero six one four it's almost religious

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.600
It's quiet recitation numbers

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.550
after five hours and nine minutes

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.599
Daniel is nearing the finish line his recall has been flawless

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.730
please

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:28.909
finished yeah

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.979
Is gobsmacking new Brilliant?

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.000
Brilliant yes

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.049
But does this mean [that] Daniel could also have learned by heart?

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.629
thousands of different calculations, or

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.789
Does he has he claims have some strange power to see the answers in his head?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.140
His childhood holds a dramatic clue

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:07.469
One of nine [children] brought up in east London Daniel claims that he's been able to do massive calculations since he was only four

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160
I had

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.389
quite a severe seizure as a very small child a

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.000
series of seizures and a diagnosis of epilepsy was made

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.730
His childhood fits [seemed] to have changed something in his brain

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.770
It's really from that time that I started [to] to see pictures in my mind

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.440
[images] started to to form

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.380
intuitively Daniel also began to perceive the patterns within numbers

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:48.220
Cases like this are extremely rare yet there are others who have also suffered injury to the brain only

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.759
to emerge with a startling and often similar kind of talent

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.189
Orlando [Saral] was just 10 when he received his [fateful]. Blow me a friend playing baseball

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.960
I was [a] batter ran the first base. They got through the ball and ball hit on my left side [ahead]

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.780
It was a hard hit right [up] in this area right up in there, and I just laid on the ground [I]

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.379
Didn't go to hospital. They get no treatment or nothing

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.580
to his surprise

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:23.410
Ball and [I'm] soon discovered [that] he could name the day of the week and recall the weather for any date since his accident

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.099
Number 17 latinate is on a Sunday with sunshine and clear skies june 3rd. 1985 was on a Monday

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.400
It was hot March 28th 1990s on a Wednesday sunshine

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760
second

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:42.519
Symmetries [third] next time she was on a winton so much money for [8] miles on a Sunday cloudy, [I] can't explain it

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:44.519
[but] his pops right into my head

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:49.479
Somehow the circuitry in his brain is computing calendar dates

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.169
What part of my brain is darkness? [I] don't know

00:09:54.949 --> 00:10:00.279
Both Orlando and Daniel seem to possess special powers of perception as well as enhanced memory

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.760
There are only a handful of people like this worldwide, and they are known to science as savants

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:16.690
The concept was popularized by the hit movie rain man where actor Dustin Hoffman plays the part of a brilliantly gifted misfit?

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:24.069
Like rain man most Savants Lack normal Social skills often because they're autistic in

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:30.159
Fact the link with autism is so strong that we wondered whether it could be a factor in Daniels abilities

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.249
Cambridge neuroscientist [professor] Simon baron-Cohen [an] expert on autism will be making a careful assessment

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:49.359
autism is a spectrum of medical conditions where people have a lot of difficulty in forming social relationships and

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:55.240
in putting themselves into other people's shoes to imagine other people's thoughts and feelings, but

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:02.200
it's also where the individual develops very strong narrow interests obsessions and

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.839
Likes to do things in a very repetitive way

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:08.529
So it's a mix of ability and disability

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.639
25 Year-old Daniel seems to have lots of ability yet, no obvious disability

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:23.500
Today he's joined by his mother who will help to reconstruct Daniels turtle amongst her other children

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.430
Or any of them her memories it turns out are still vivid

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.530
If you had Daniel's first childhood never have another child because the constant crying

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.250
Up until now nearly the age of Tori was a real handful

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.670
He would just cry

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.610
constantly

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.449
We took to even swinging him in a blanket his bed would be at one end of the bank

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.560
I would [of] [yet], and we we resorted to that out of desperation. [did] you like that?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.170
Yes, what sort of time? Do you like [the] sort of repetitive me? Yes? Yes [let's] [serve] him

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:13.789
The repetition seemed to [soothe] him and that's again a right sort of classic autistic characteristic [I]

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.930
mean if you if you think back [to] the days when [he] was at primary school with were the teachers at all and

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:27.919
Concerned about him. What did they talk about him as if he was different in some way? You know what would happen during break time?

00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:35.909
think about the capstone remember counting stones and also there was a

00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:40.919
Set called hopscotch. Yeah, so I would count the numbers on top

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.670
This was what interested me. [this] is what I would do and nothing else about

00:12:52.760 --> 00:13:00.590
I know you didn't integrate that well. I remember you walking around the playground and looking at up at the trees

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:10.139
I'd walk around the trees and look at the leaves like [allah] [pathan] [son] learn and leaves in the bog

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:20.570
There seems to have the complexity within in shapes, and yeah textures that reminds me of you Embers, right?

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.969
Numbers for me have always been it's like the most real thing for me

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.870
From the time I was about five I've almost looked through

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.520
numbers lumps

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:42.009
I mean my legs the way I've looked at the world allow me so [I'll] always count things so I'll

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.559
Look at something and say that looks like

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.870
131 [fix-up] what that looks like 52 and

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:58.150
Just always thinking that this is how everyone else [experiences] numbers you know that that this is a normal thing

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:06.580
He got most pleasure out of just taking the maths books home and lying in his bedroom floor alone

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.909
Going as far as he could with

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:17.229
Numerical problems and just understanding numbers thing much more comfortable in a world of of numbers than people

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:23.830
Daniel's obsession with maths is at least part of the explanation phase special ability with numbers

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.099
The things that he always felt were his friends

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.500
Because I was so different

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.570
Mm-Hmm the children who would be bullies didn't know what to do with me

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.760
you know they didn't know how to teach me, so they just

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.430
Let me be pretty much

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:45.760
by most measures Daniel is autistic, but he's also picked up enough social skills to blend in the

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.450
[one] Criterion that really is missing

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:56.859
To warrant a diagnosis is that his symptoms are not really interfering currently with his life

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:03.849
For whatever reason he's managed to to adapt to our world

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:12.489
Daniel is lucky rare abilities like his usually come with severe mental handicap as part of the price

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.080
Dane, Bertino is a savant - [but] very different from

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.640
The one thing his gift is not the maths

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:34.299
We knew by two and a half that dane wasn't talking but instead

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.580
He was just expressing himself through art. He was drawing night and day

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.060
Since he was a toddler dane has been able to draw with extraordinary precision

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.120
But there's always been [a] flipside to his talent

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.760
Chinese language and social skills remain childlike

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:18.120
Even as his art becomes richer. He really pays attention to the little my new details

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.869
But he would put the emotion in

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.690
He loves drawing in the sand

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.970
And he enjoys watching the waves come in and wash it away

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.679
And then draw something else because he draws really quickly, so he likes to see things

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.770
changed so that he can [draw] something new

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:54.280
How is this remarkable boys seeing the world it would be fascinating to [know] if only he could tell us

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:04.030
What makes Daniel different from Sevens like dane, and so extremely valuable to science? Is that he can describe?

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.030
What's going on inside his head

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.089
expense numbers in a very visual way using

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.650
colors

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.769
texture shape you form

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.240
sequences for numbers

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.860
form

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.860
landscapes in my mind

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.660
It just happens. It's like having a full dimension

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:31.158
One for [XampP'] would [be] very bright very bright

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.649
And shiny numbers. It's almost like somebody flashing a light in my face you know today

00:17:36.649 --> 00:17:42.949
It's a very interesting experience number two is kind of like a movement right to left the kind of like a drifting

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.470
motion five is

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.779
Like the clap of Thunder or the sound of a wave against the rock

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:54.888
Six is very small. It's actually the number

00:17:54.889 --> 00:18:02.539
[I] find hardest to experience in any sort of meaningful visual way, so it's it's often the absence of anything

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:08.449
It's like a whole war or a chasm or like a black hole number nine is the biggest number

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.549
It's very tall there can be intimidating

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:19.220
Daniel says he sees every number up to ten thousand as a distinct shape or image

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.620
Until recently many researchers would have dismissed this is mumbo Jumbo?

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.230
But there is now a sound

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.480
scientific explanation

00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:33.768
Different parts of our brain are specialized with different tasks

00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:36.570
juggling numbers for example

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.549
or seeing shapes

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:44.418
If cross activation occurs between areas that are normally separate then things can get very mixed up

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.809
You might hear a sound and see a color

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.839
Or think a number and feel emotion

00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:54.049
scientists call this weird phenomenon

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.330
synesthesia

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.690
Duncan less on of Julian Ashes and a researcher at Cambridge University

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.930
Experiences, synesthesia himself, but is struck by how peculiar it is in Daniel

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.700
[the] [most] synesthetes what they see is much more abstract for instance

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:18.039
I see what almost might be colored flames the sort of a flickering flowing movement

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.070
But Daniel sees very concrete shapes. Which is quite unusual

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.699
Is the entire number drifting upwards as it?

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:30.009
Julian believes that daniels complex imagery is the key to his gigantic memory

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:37.059
When he's recalling a number to twenty two thousand and five hundred digits what he's doing is moving mentally through a synesthetic landscape

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.600
ineffectively reading the numbers from the landscape

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.779
But are daniels numbers shapes also the key [to] his maths ability

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:55.269
To find out more were sending in to San Diego center for brain studies in California where he'll be grilled by skeptical scientists

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.470
First though he'll be traveling across America [and] putting some of his mental powers to the test

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.200
Daniel is in New York, but not as we know it

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:17.050
For someone who reads numbers into everything the city is giving him a strange vibe

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.320
Being in New [York]. We've all these huge skyscrapers

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:32.979
It's intimidating for me and over the time. I had this sensation and being surrounded by nine number nine is all around me

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.829
Can be very [nerve-racking] experience?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.320
Seeing objects as numbers as something [Daniel] has grown up with

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.870
It can be a little distracting

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.020
But it's also something he can use to his advantage

00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.459
Daniel is going to meet the chess hustlers, but he won't be playing chess instead. He proposed a memory game

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:11.410
[Daniel] he wants five minutes to memorize a board with 26 randomly placed pieces

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.859
And he's offering [ten] bucks for every mistake he makes

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.420
It's an offer they can't refuse

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:29.499
Us having to imagine that it was on a chess board by the sequence of numbers, and then I was experiencing the numbers as imagery

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.799
Time's up and the heat is on

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:07.039
like in there

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.250
Yeah C6

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:16.339
d 5 they scrutinize daniels positions have trying to find fault for

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.799
[I] pretty much got it spot on. I think there was one piece. I didn't put on the board

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.770
It's pretty good [when] Fuller being a nine chess player

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:27.539
now with the hustle

00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:33.259
Do you mind if [we] take the pieces off and test one of you two guys you're you're pretty good jasper?

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.179
Well like I said, I'm I'm pretty impressed with you

00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:38.089
I don't know if I can tap with one of you my friend would like to do it

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.549
But I don't know if I can honestly we can give you as much

00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:43.158
We can give you an extra few minutes if you really want to study

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.370
Okay, okay

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:07.159
The other guided chess hustler. I take my hat off when he was game he went for it [and] did it I?

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:24.199
Was actually impressed personally speaking. He did better than I thought he [would] do

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.740
I think he made my mistakes

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:36.289
For me that's amazing. Ooh a piece that you remembered you remembered in the whitewater. If he's not experiencing the pieces in any

00:23:37.049 --> 00:23:38.490
distinctive way

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.919
And yet? He's able to do that. It shows that war memory is really good

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.870
If you're talking memory though as one man, who is in a league of his own?

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.779
He's the world's most famous Savant and Daniel's next stop on route to California

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:06.089
Daniel's next stop is the one he's been savoring a meeting with the real rain man

00:24:16.929 --> 00:24:20.829
I'm looking forward to meeting kim peek because he's meant to be amazing

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.730
He was the guy [that] the main man [character] was based on

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.460
This is really

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.059
Exciting for me because it's my first time meeting someone

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.640
else with whom I

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.830
Have this bond

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.999
Daniel makes his way to salt Lake City's problem and his father a waiting room

00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:52.720
Nice to meet you

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.880
Let's walk down here. We can have a line they head off to a quiet [corner]

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:02.459
But Daniel can find out more about Kim stupendous memory time [timely]

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.319
With total photographic memory he remembers everything he's ever read

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:13.949
He can tell you the every city in the united states its highways and its area codes and its zip codes and its television

00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:15.330
stations in his counties

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.309
And when it was made a state history of any country all the rulers [and] when they served

00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:26.069
Presidents of this country when they were born their wives their families all of Nasa's accomplishments

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:31.500
So when they went up when they came down what they're doing you could talk to you about the bible. He can quote scriptures

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.899
He can tell you anything about if you want to asking about

00:25:36.129 --> 00:25:38.399
It seems like everything he reads

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.730
He maintained

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.960
and nine months

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:52.339
Neuropsychiatry said he said severely mentally retarded [he] will never be able to learn you should

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.160
Put him in an institution forget about him

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:02.359
But Kim was reading, encyclopedias by age four and had finished the high school curriculum by [fourteen]

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.810
Goodbye [y'all] pain imma

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:12.529
Leave and cheyenne, you know that how fast can he mean he reads a page that

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.050
You and I would read and in three minutes approximately it takes you about [eight] to [ten] seconds

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:28.239
He reads left pages left eye right page of the right eye, and that [number] [is] about 98 percent of it go back through here

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.660
Keep my birth date is January 31st

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.819
1979 it wasn't it was a it was [a] Wednesday?

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.250
[this] year it's a a Saturday returned [2044] on a Sunday

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:51.860
What you did Queen Victoria had become great through Sona 1901

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.540
Came if Winston Churchill was alive today. Howard. Would he be?

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.670
130 and what day of the week would his birthday [fall] on this year?

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.330
It would be on a Tuesday the last day of nowhere

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:12.860
in 1987 Kim met actor Dustin Hoffman and became the inspiration for the hit movie rain man

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:20.089
We went on Hollywood the next morning and Kim spent the day with Dustin and all of his film friends

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.319
Because it was amazing all the things they asked him and all the things he knew

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.140
It was just like I had known [lee] before there were so many new things that came out of me

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.840
Although I'm much older

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.319
You're still a fine man and to

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:43.760
Some of you. Yes, sir. He says you don't have to be handicapped to be different because everybody's different

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:56.109
Though all Sorts of associations bubbling over in his mind. No wonder you look like Mary ruth

00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:00.969
As it was almost as if he had too much information, and he couldn't get it out quickly enough

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.330
He's parting words to me. Well we looked into each other's eyes, and he said

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:13.150
One day, you'll be as great as I am and that was a wonderful compliment, and we'll aspiration to have

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.089
Before he encounters the scientists Daniel is making one last stop

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:36.259
Inspired by rain man. He's in Las Vegas to see if he can use his amazing memory to beat the house

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.490
For someone who hates crowds and flashing lights. It's an unsettling kind of Place I

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:04.550
Haven't actually been in a casino before I play cards with friends sometimes it up by playing with me

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.789
In blackjack [the] dealer has the advantage and even for a card counter it still comes down to chance

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.259
it was actually really hard to concentrate because

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.940
The white light [the] noise the atmosphere a strange mixture

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.610
tension and excitement all in one

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:34.260
Daniel is playing two rounds with eight decks inch that's over 400 cards to keep track of at once

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:46.549
Round one is a disaster daniels chips are disappearing fast and memory alone. Just isn't giving him an edge

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:50.059
Eventually he changes strategy

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:58.749
And follows his instincts the end. I was [just] relying on intuition and dimitri as it flows into my mind

00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:04.159
at the most on promising Moment Daniel decides to Gamble [the]

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.559
[house] had a [ten] which the [regel] card and I was given two sevens

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:12.829
And that's Nanak would hand and is particularly not a good hand against a 10

00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:17.989
What I decided to do was split the sevens an unusual move

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.439
statistically speaking not the best move but

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.470
Something in my head was telling me to do that anyway because of the imagery that I was experiencing and so I split the 7th

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:33.500
Doubled my bet was given a third card, and it wasn't anatomy a 7 and at this stage

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.329
I was really sure of the [wards] of the game because this the first time I played blackjack in a casino so [asked] can I

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.330
split those two

00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:42.460
Then she's surprised

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:48.039
she says sure if you want to so she splits those and so I now have free hands at one time against a 10 and

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:53.110
The people behind me at a teen and they're you know they're saying what what is he doing?

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:58.000
You know he's so but he's playing free hands against a 10 he's splitting [70] comes a 10. He's crazy and

00:30:58.789 --> 00:31:04.929
Then she draws the remaining cards for each seven he hits 21 on his first hand

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.830
and again [on] second

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.509
That's two out of two. Who'd bet against the hat trick now

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.540
That's 321 his sixth sense proves a winner and in one fell swoop

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.049
Daniel Squares his losses. How did you get [that]?

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.579
[one] I don't care if I lose now that was fantastic

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:42.169
But daniel needs to stay sharp [as] he heads for California and the showdown that really counts

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.329
At San Diego's center for brain studies. He's about to face a series of tests

00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:57.079
But he really have some kind of sixth-sense an ability with numbers that goes Beyond just memory

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.569
Neuroscientist professor Ramachandran and his team are intrigued by the idea

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.469
But have their doubts when rama first came to me and said hey, we've got this math savant

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:16.040
That's coming here, and he can do 4x4 multiplication and he can recognize primes and he can do

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:24.140
Division out to so many decimal places. I thought yay. [I] he's probably faking it or he's got it memorized. You know

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.140
there's all sorts of techniques, and I'm

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:28.639
Very much a big skeptic of this

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.989
With the pleasantries over the testing can [begin]

00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:36.049
27 to the power of

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.540
Six oh, can you do to [pump] some?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.200
Okay

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:50.470
one zero four six zero three five three two zero three

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.150
That's not

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.850
Better than the calculator. [I] need to see whether or not that zero three is correct

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.489
But you know I have a feeling it would be

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.240
[31] four out of six

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:29.409
Daniels jet Lag is wrecking his concentration and slowing him up

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.440
Seven five seven three six eight

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.270
spectacular

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:51.249
Daniel has certainly impressed the scientists with his ability to calculate, but they're keeping an open mind about his method

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:56.770
Okay, here. We are confronted with somebody who claims to [have] amazing computational skills?

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:04.330
And when we tested him with some simple [numbers] doing a number 2 G [two-digit] number like 37 [^]?

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.960
7

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:12.489
Very very quickly gave us the accurate announcer, and we did this [with] several different numbers the question is how was he doing him?

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:19.240
One possibility is that Daniel has trained himself to do super fast calculations in his head?

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:23.650
As we're about to see the human brain can do incredible things

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:35.170
Believe it or not an extraordinary. Maths ability like daniels is something that ordinary people can learn

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:41.229
Here in tokyo some schools still teach the ancient art the abacus

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.838
Children start [learning] the basic skills aged [four] and practice every [day]

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.700
like

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.380
me

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:07.320
by the time they're 12 these whiz kids are fast becoming human calculators to

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:12.599
[be] sure lessons are not for the Faint-hearted

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:22.500
Well, I'm sometimes bare strict so some child cry perhaps or sometimes I hit them but they keep

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:29.520
Coming [here]. I hope they're happy, but when they're training they never have a smile on their faces

00:35:30.369 --> 00:35:34.799
nevertheless eight years of hard slog can produce jaw-dropping results

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:40.109
12 year Old Kota Cazuca is top of the class I

00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:48.899
Practiced two hours on weekdays, and then now it's on the weekend. I want to become a national champion I

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:57.510
Along with the other high [fliers]. He can now do huge calculations with a purely imaginary abacus

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.450
manipulating nothing, but the thin air

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:19.818
Children like this show us that with enough practice superfast mental calculation is possible hi

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.150
Hey, Ma, Ma

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.839
Yeah, Daniel insists. He's [not] doing this kind of conscious calculation at all

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.389
He says the answers come to him spontaneously out of his mental imagery

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.210
Rama and his team of finding it hard to trip daniel up, but they're not finished with him yet

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.760
If daniels descriptions of his numbers are real then they should also be consistent

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.689
[Ramin] asks Daniel to model some of his numbers with Play-doh

00:36:48.329 --> 00:36:51.468
But doesn't tell him that he'll be retested the next day

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:59.390
It's hard to imagine him having memorized shapes the question is are they the same shape so we can actually compare that now?

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.390
That's two for two

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.410
Now let's see is two for two today

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:06.589
Overall there's a remarkable similarity

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:09.738
That's very interesting. Let's take

00:37:10.799 --> 00:37:12.509
58

00:37:12.509 --> 00:37:14.629
again same story very similar

00:37:15.329 --> 00:37:17.329
Same color same shape

00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:20.448
But not exactly the same

00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:25.789
810 from today

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:31.879
810 from yesterday, and again, it's very precise shape

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.419
So general impression is he seems to be producing the same shapes consistently?

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:42.139
[Daniel] has cruised the consistency test

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:48.349
But rama and his team are still dubious that Daniel reacts emotionally to certain numbers I?

00:37:49.529 --> 00:37:57.438
Was a little bit mean, and I played a trick on Daniel. He said he loved pie because it was beautiful. It was just this

00:37:58.529 --> 00:38:03.859
Wonderful special shape well if it's so beautiful for him, and he normally gets this

00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:08.418
Wonderful warm reaction from pie I thought that I would show him

00:38:08.969 --> 00:38:10.829
something that

00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:14.899
initially would look like pie on the surface 3.14 and

00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:21.168
tweak it a little bit throw in numbers like [six] which he doesn't like

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:26.700
The small electrodes attached to Daniels fingers are like a lie detector

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.720
They'll measure any emotional response good or bad

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:36.299
So if Daniel is shown a number that he really loves there should be a [clear-cut] signal

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.200
So sure enough. [I] showed him this

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.460
Bastardized version of Pi and we saw this very nice

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:50.039
You know warm the galvanic skin response and then all and it jumped up and then all of a sudden

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:57.090
it jumped again and as he was scanning it we kept getting another jolt and another jolt and another jolt and it wouldn't stop and

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:03.029
Afterwards I was asking what's going on in your head when you were seeing that and he said well

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.160
you know here's this beautiful number pi that I love and I see it and then as

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.510
I'm looking at the landscape all of a sudden. There's a pit where it's not supposed to be and

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.350
you know this mountain is missing and and it's really it's

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.789
wrong and how could you do that something so beautiful and

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.720
And you know while it was a little bit mean to do that to him

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.230
It [really] shows the point

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.400
that he

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:34.259
Does have some sense of emotion associated with these numbers because the skin response was off the charts?

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.170
It was something you just can't fake

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.170
these are the things

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.010
Specifically that are showing me

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:49.620
He's not bullshitting and he's not scamming even the mistakes that Daniel is making are the mistakes that tell me

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.210
You know what?

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.229
This is this is legit a faker wouldn't be doing this

00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:01.920
So if Daniel is the real how is he able to do such huge calculations without any conscious effort?

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.970
You did this computation in your head what exactly was going on in your head

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.720
I see an image in my [head] and

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:16.169
That image starts to change starts to almost like evolve. It's quite vague at first as I'm looking at it. It becomes

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:25.440
Clearer and clearer over a time and then from from that landscape I can read the digits out [sort] [of] gradually crystallized. Yes

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:30.509
In a multiplication the two numbers hover before him has distinct shapes

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:36.930
The Gap in between makes a third shape which Daniel experiences as a new number

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.129
The correct answer he's doing there, but he doesn't even know it

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:47.310
When it comes to numbers it seems that Daniels brain really is doing something extraordinary

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:52.080
I'm blown away something the scientists can't yet get a handle on

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:57.509
This could be the linchpin that spawns off a new field of research

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.679
But we still had one last test for Daniel

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:14.550
Daniel is now flying to Iceland for [his] ultimate challenge

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:23.010
We've given him a week to learn a totally new language from scratch, and then go live on National television

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.459
Even the locals say that icelandic is confusing and unpronounceable

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:36.919
the difficult bit is the grammar [I] would say but we have funny sounds where he had no remember [that] never do like a

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:39.410
sound like this

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.060
with the clock ticking

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.060
Daniel Badly needs some lessons

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:50.089
But his teacher doesn't seem hopeful there was a minute, but it's impossible to know an iCelandic

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:55.249
So the four is that I get to tate's they have this feeling. It's like he would say impossible

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.889
Impossible thoughtful for a human to learn this in a week just [collect]

00:42:01.099 --> 00:42:05.149
That's the icelandic word for impossible. You know colloquial. Speak if a knife is

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.230
Daniels Brain Power may have met its limits

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.010
First when you get into a new language is like a person

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.140
You just that's what you're here

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:18.800
You don't [hear] would you just hit a little bit a little bit and for the ear

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:26.659
It takes time to adjust and tune in and trying to find the sounds if you're just like me, it's one thing to

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.139
Learn the language to speak it to be able to produce it as touchy you know talk with somebody

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.960
comprehension actually listening to the language and

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:43.520
Understanding it that's that something else because takes time fully here to actually get used to the totally different sounds

00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:46.069
Gonna Pop gone back in One Day

00:42:46.819 --> 00:42:48.819
Queer tax taxes

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:56.020
With a day to go before daniels live chat show his teachers early doubts returning to amazement

00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:02.409
It was like a watching cleaner. I can see you were sucking up the words and he was this putting it in his raid

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.880
little by Little hour by hour

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:10.470
I'm just beginning to tune in and hear more and more of the language and understand more and more of it

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:14.369
It's one thing to chat with your teacher

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:18.810
Speaking live to a quarter of a million people is the real test I

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.660
Have no idea. What will come out?

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.260
Tomorrow [night] if you get too stressed nothing's Gonna come out

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:36.669
The seven days are up and Daniel is making last-minute preparations before. He goes live on air

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:40.870
just [given]

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.160
Okay, tell me rent

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.580
Minton Ultra-left minions [where] to Milan on [isLa] de

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:59.779
La Reina Tolliver Daniel tomato, eastland school nestor minuteness, welcoming welcoming retinue him [genki] a letter

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:07.430
your fell back a sense carefully make e so fat leg [oh]

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.940
[Yeah], Air [Feta] [Lyra] Um

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.090
how co telkom

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:20.420
Vega y, aca [Iceland] Inca [Dalla] is let's go air ah

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.780
So I eat them

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.519
enzo Anda Or yang ff isn't School Ozma

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:39.170
How well has Daniel managed to speak icelandic after just a week of learning the language from [scratch]? [yes] [lending] go?

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.150
Darla a key

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.650
mouth Ride

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:49.789
Astonishingly it looks like Daniel has pulled it off [Miata] Darla is [some] school mecha standing. Go I was amazed

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.200
He was responding to our questions. He did understand them very well and

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.880
I thought that his grammar was very good

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.080
Malanga Saya so my header

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:09.380
We are very proud of our language, and then that someone is able to speak it after only one week. That's first is great

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.240
Okay, Papa

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:18.800
This is really sustained. Ellis is definitely unique. I would say [mastered] genius and for me

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:26.779
I will never ever get in touch with a person or a student ask if that that he is because it's almost Beyond its [its]

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.240
It's not human

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:42.670
There's no doubt that abilities like Daniels are extremely rare

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:50.199
World Authority on [Sevens] Dr.. Darrell Trafford has spent a lifetime studying the rain man phenomenon and

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.169
Is in no doubt where to rank Daniel?

00:45:54.019 --> 00:45:57.758
My us two minutes are probably fewer than 50 such people living world one

00:45:57.759 --> 00:46:02.379
I think [daniels] ability is at a prodigious level because it would be spectacular

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.079
Pair were to be seen in any of us would be spectacular

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.160
Equally though Daniel has been blessed with almost miraculous. Good fortune

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.690
there lying between profound

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:23.589
talent and Profound disability seems really and surprisingly finland

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:30.939
The way Daniel can describe his inner world is giving scientists a window into the brain that they've never heard

00:46:32.509 --> 00:46:35.289
But the truth is the Journey of exploration

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:38.029
Is only just beginning?

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:42.909
The bigger question is whether we all have some of those abilities within us and that?

00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:46.599
Is what I refer to as [the] little rain man within each [of] us

00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:51.999
What I do it isn't, I don't think it's you can actually [think] it's something

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.119
I can't be explained who knows there may be [abilities] head everyone can perhaps tap into in some way

00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:04.869
Savant syndrome is challenging us to think in new Ways about intelligence and what intelligence is

00:47:21.809 --> 00:47:23.809
you
