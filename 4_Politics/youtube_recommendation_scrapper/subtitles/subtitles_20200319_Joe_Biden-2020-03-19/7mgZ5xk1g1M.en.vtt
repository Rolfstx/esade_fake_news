-As concerns grow

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:05.304
about the government's handling
of the coronavirus outbreak,

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.305
the president is calling

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.174
criticism of his response
a hoax.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.176
For more on this, it's time
for "A Closer Look."

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:14.614
[ Suspenseful theme plays ]
[ Cheering and applause ]

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.382
This was yet another weekend

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.119
in our manic,
head-spinning political era

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.354
where major news stories were
breaking, one after another.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.524
The Trump era has turned all
of us into cats trying

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.026
to follow on multiple laser
pointers at once.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.595
[ Laughter ]
Stock market!
Democratic primary!

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.729
Eclipse!

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.566
[ Laughter ]
For one thing, Joe Biden won

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.435
a landslide victory in the
South Carolina primary

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.071
on Saturday and, as a result,
two of his rivals,

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.472
Pete Buttigieg
and Amy Klobuchar,

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.008
dropped out and announced
they would endorse Biden.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.476
Meanwhile, the third candidate
who dropped out,

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.912
Tom Steyer, did it immediately
on election night,

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.580
one day after dancing onstage

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.248
during a rally
in South Carolina.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.617
to Juvenile's
"Back That Azz Up."

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:53.552
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:56.423
I can guarantee that,
when Juvenile wrote that song,

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.258
that is not the ass
he had in mind.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.827
[ Laughter and applause ]
I'm sorry,

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.329
but nobody wearing that tie

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.631
should ever dance like that.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.831
[ Laughter ]

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.766
You look like a chaperone
at a prep school prom,

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.636
trying to get the nerds
onto the dance floor.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.003
[ Laughter ]

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.039
In fact, the last few days
have been so jam-packed,

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.441
we don't even have time to talk
about the super weird fact that,

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:18.444
on Saturday, at the Conservative
Political Action Conference,

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.213
Trump not only hugged,
but also kissed,

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:21.948
[ Laughter ]
the American flag

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.650
while mouthing the words,
"I love you, baby."

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.418
[ Laughter ]
I mean, 'cause, believe me,

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:27.653
we could spend a whole

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.154
10 minutes on that.
I mean, seriously,

00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:30.790
what is going on here?

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.991
[ Laughter ]
If Trump's not careful,

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.359
he's gonna have pay hush money
to Betsy Ross.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.661
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:36.829
This is more intimate than

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.998
that Lady Gaga-Bradley Cooper
performance

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.232
[ Laughter ]
at last year's Oscars.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.334
In fact, just to give you
an idea how much

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:45.137
was happening this weekend,
the president announced

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:47.206
that he had negotiated
a peace deal with the Taliban,

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.943
and that wasn't even one
of the top news stories.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.944
On Saturday,
Trump held a press conference

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:54.347
to update the nation
on the coronavirus outbreak,

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.417
but he started by trying to draw
attention to the Taliban deal.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.918
And, look, personally,
I am in favor

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.953
of any attempt
to end our longest war

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:02.254
and bring our troops home.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.789
It's something we should've
done a long time ago.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.392
But it would be nice to have
a president that we could trust

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.228
to coherently explain
the details to us.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.596
And, yet, even when he tried
to start the press conference

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:11.998
by talking
about this Taliban deal,

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.534
all Trump could do
was ramble drowsily,

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.669
like he just woke up
from an afternoon nap.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.639
-Before we begin, I'd like to

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.643
congratulate all
of those incredible people

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.379
that have worked for so long

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.548
on our endless war

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:32.084
[ Laughter ]
and will be

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.721
very much hoping that

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.522
they will be doing what they say

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:37.523
they're going to be doing.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.692
They will be killing terrorists.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:43.796
They will be killing
some very bad people.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:47.366
[ Laughter ]
And, again, it's been --

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.601
it's been a long journey,

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.903
in Afghanistan, in particular,

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:52.572
but this was a --

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:55.208
a...very...

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.643
uh, spirited

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:58.711
agreement.

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.080
[ Laughter ]
There was a lot of, uh,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.381
a lotta talk.

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.885
Uh, I really believe the Taliban
wants to do something

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.688
to show that we're not
all wasting time.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:11.424
-You're wasting time!

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:14.093
[ Laughter and applause ]
Just tell us what's in the deal.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:16.962
I honestly expected
an award show orchestra

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:17.964
to start playing him off.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.932
[ Laughter ]
-It will be --

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:24.536
[ Music sweeps ]
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.139
So, the original point
of Saturday's press conference

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.240
was supposed to be

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.974
to update Americans
on the coronavirus

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:31.176
and quell fears about the
government's bumbling response

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:32.445
because the administration

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.347
has not been doing a lot
to reassure Americans.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:35.782
He put his vice president,
Mike Pence,

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.618
in charge of controlling
all coronavirus messaging

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:39.986
from health officials
and Trump himself

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.622
dismissed the danger at the
White House on Thursday.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.557
-We have done an incredible job.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.459
We're going to continue.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.194
It's going to disappear
one day.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.262
It's like miracle.
It will disappear.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:51.997
And, from our shores,

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:54.533
you know, it could get worse
before it gets better.

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:55.668
Could maybe go away.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:56.669
We'll see what happens.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:57.836
Nobody really knows.

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:59.738
The fact is
the greatest experts,

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:01.774
I've spoken to them all.
Nobody really knows.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.175
-Alright, first of all,

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:05.978
I doubt you've spoken
to all the greatest experts.

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:07.346
[ Laughter ]
I can't even begin

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:08.647
to imagine a conversation

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:10.283
between a scientist
and Donald Trump.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.984
It would be
like watching Bill Gates

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:13.886
explain the Internet to a dog.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.822
[ Laughter and applause ]
Second, it' not reassuring,

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.925
in the midst of a crisis,
to hear the most powerful man

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.526
in the world say
nobody knows what will happen.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.061
It's like hearing
your captain say,

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.196
"We're goin'
through some turbulence.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.630
We might make it
to our destination,

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.631
but nobody really knows.

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.933
If we do, it'll be a miracle."

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.701
[ Laughter ]

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:32.337
Just because you don't know
doesn't mean nobody knows.

00:04:32.337 --> 00:04:35.241
Yes, there are unknowns,
but there are also experts

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.209
studying the situation right now
and learning things.

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.011
You should you maybe
check in with them.

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.479
Instead, the administration
has been busy

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.281
with other, less urgent, tasks.

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.183
Pence, the guy who's supposed
to be in charge of all this,

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:45.718
spent Friday
at a high-dollar fundraiser

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.320
for Republicans in Florida.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.455
And, as for the president --
and this is real --

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.757
The Daily Beast reported that,
on Friday at the White House,

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.326
Trump spent 45 minutes talking
to the lead actors

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:55.928
of a low-budget
conservative play

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.497
about the so-called deep state.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.164
Alright.
I have so many questions.

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:01.433
First of all, why is Trump
meeting with actors in a play?

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:03.436
[ Laughter ]
I doubt he's ever sat

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:04.570
through a play in his life.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.606
He probably went
"Hairspray" by accident,

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:07.739
thinking it was a tutorial.

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.241
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.976
[as Trump] I need to learn how
to freeze my hair in place

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:12.711
so that it's fully
wind-resistant.

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:15.348
[ Applause and laughter ]

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:18.484
Although, I will say,
judging from this photo,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.586
you'd think he was starring
in the Broadway adaptation

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:21.586
of "Beetlejuice."

00:05:21.586 --> 00:05:23.088
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:25.258
So that's what the president
spending his time doing

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.892
while he should've been
monitoring developments

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:28.360
with the coronavirus
and coming up

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.028
with a reassuring
government response

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:32.798
and, now, he and his allies
are attacking Democrats

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:35.334
for supposedly
politicizing the crisis.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:37.603
At this very moment, healthcare
professionals are warning

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.872
about the lack
of widespread accurate testing,

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.908
with one
infectious disease expert

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.676
calling it a national scandal
and, yet,

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.612
Trump and his allies have been
attacking Democrats in the media

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.580
simply for pointing out
these very real problems,

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.916
with Trump himself
even calling criticism

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:53.785
of his response to the outbreak
a hoax.

00:05:53.785 --> 00:05:55.721
-They're now sadly politicizing

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:58.691
and actually weaponizing
an infectious disease

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.060
in what is basically just
the latest effort

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.761
to bludgeon President Trump.

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:05.698
-It looks like

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.567
the coronavirus
is being weaponized

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:12.371
as yet another element
to bring down Donald Trump.

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.039
-The reason you're paying --

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.174
you're seeing so much
attention to it today

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:17.643
is that they think
this is gonna be

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:18.677
what brings down the president.

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:21.280
-Now, the Democrats are

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.684
politicizing the coronavirus.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:25.718
[ Booing ]
You know that, right?

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.186
Coronavirus.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:31.557
They tried the impeachment hoax
and this is their new hoax.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.826
-A hoax?
I think part of the problem here

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.728
is that Trump only knows
like five words

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:36.862
and hoax is one of them.

00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:39.031
[ Laughter ]
His brain is like a Mad Lib

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:41.901
with the same word written in
for every sentence.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.503
[ Laughter ]

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:45.838
[ Applause ]
So, on Saturday, Trump tried

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:47.740
to defend his handling
of the crisis

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.375
and, in doing so,
he once again lied

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.510
about the speed of his
government's response.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.513
-Since the early stages
of the foreign outbreak,

00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:57.683
my administration has taken
the most aggressive action

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:03.188
in modern history to confront
the spread of this disease.

00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:05.124
We moved very early.

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:07.994
Experts now agree
that the decision

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:11.330
to move so quickly,
despite a lot of opposition

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.600
on that decision,
was, uh, a wise one.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.234
It greatly slowed

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:18.971
the spread of the virus
to the United States.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.272
-No, you didn't move quickly.

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:22.107
For one thing,
you never move quickly.

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:24.476
You lumber around the
White House lawn in circles,

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:27.646
like an only child on
an Easter egg hunt by himself.

[ Laughter and applause ]
Second, there's new evidence

00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:32.718
suggesting the virus may have
been spreading for weeks,

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.620
the problem worsened, in part,
by the fact that

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.422
we haven't had widespread
national testing,

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:38.891
which would make sense because,
when reports of the outbreak

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.860
first began to make news
around the world,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.628
this is how
the president responded.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.631
-The virus.
They're working hard.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.366
Looks like, by April,
you know, in theory,

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.600
when it gets a little warmer,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.169
it miraculously goes away.
I hope that's true.

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.274
The coronavirus,
that's a new thing

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:56.608
that a lot of people
are talking about.

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:59.044
Hopefully, it won't be

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:01.113
as bad as some people
think it could be.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:04.649
And we think it's going to have
a very good ending for us.

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:06.485
Hopefully,
it's all gonna be great.

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:08.821
Maybe there's something new
'cause, for two days,

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.290
I haven't been seeing
too much of that news.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.926
Now, the virus that we're
talking about having to do,

00:08:14.926 --> 00:08:17.630
you know, a lot of people think
that goes away in April,

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.565
with the heat,
as the heat comes in.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:22.001
[ Laughter ]
Typically, that will go
away in April.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.402
We're in great shape, though.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:27.105
-Where did you get this idea
that it goes away in April?

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:29.541
Are you confusing it with Lent?

You know, it starts in February

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:33.645
and it usually
goes away in April,

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:36.249
but you have to give something
up to avoid catching it.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.049

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.755
Yet, of course, of course,

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:45.625
somehow, the president
is not even

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.693
the dumbest Donald Trump
to weigh in on this story

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.128
because, in case you forgot,
there's a second Donald Trump

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:52.598
and he had this truly
disgusting thing

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.999
to say on Friday.

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:57.603
-Anything that they can use
to try to hurt Trump, they will.

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:01.373
For them to try to take
a pandemic and seemingly hope

00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:04.109
that it comes here
and kills millions of people

00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:07.413
so that they could end
Donald Trump's streak of winning

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.715
is a new level of sickness.

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.683
-Jesus!
Someone is desperately trying

00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:13.185
to get their father
to love them.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:28.834
This is the kind
of crisis management situation

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:31.337
where you want competent,
apolitical people in charge.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.672
Instead, we have
an administration

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:35.173
that would rather spend its time
raising money,

00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:36.809
meeting with the actors
in a right-wing play,

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:38.244
and cuddling
with American flags.

All we can do, for now,
is stay calm

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.048
and listen to the advice
of healthcare professionals and,

one day.
