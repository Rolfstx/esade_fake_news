00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:08.280
MICHAEL KIRK - Let’s start with the naming
of President Putin back in 1999.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.380
What was the expectation when he steps up?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.700
And even earlier than that, why Putin?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.039
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - Well, of course,
the biggest and the initial reaction when

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.420
people heard his name being announced as acting
prime minister on the 9th of August, 1999,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.259
by President Yeltsin, the first reaction is,
“Who is that?”

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.870
Most people had never heard of this guy.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.969
He was an obscure KGB official who rose from
being deputy mayor of St. Petersburg in the

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.399
1990s to being deputy chief of staff of the
Kremlin and then director of the FSB, the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.309
Federal Security Service, the main domestic
successor to the KGB.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.010
From this position, he went on to become acting
prime minister of Russia in August of ’99.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.870
Then parliament quickly confirmed him because
nobody thought much of this.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
If you recall ‘98 and ‘99, we had a succession
of four or five prime ministers within several

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.460
months.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.399
This was considered the temp job at the time,
prime minister of Russia, so nobody paid much

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.399
attention.

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.179
I remember this well, the summer of 1999.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:16.529
Everybody was consumed with the upcoming parliamentary
election, which was scheduled for December

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:17.909
and took place in December of 1999.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.840
By the way, this was the last national parliamentary
election in Russia that was assessed by European

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.820
and international monitors as free and fair
and as conforming to democratic standards.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.399
So for the past almost 18 years, we have not
had a free and fair national election in our

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.479
country, just as an aside.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.490
But at the time, everybody was consumed with
the election, and nobody really paid attention

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.569
to some guy who was made prime minister, as
many people thought this was only going to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.189
be for a few weeks or few months, just like
the others.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.459
Now, of course, here we are 18 years on, the
man is still in power.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.469
He’s now approaching the record of Leonid
Brezhnev, one of the longest serving leaders

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.619
of the Soviet Union and in many ways a symbol
of Soviet totalitarian stagnation.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.459
Brezhnev [had] been in power for 18 years,
and as of this August, or, to be more precise,

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.709
as of December 2017, Vladimir Putin will have
been in power for 18 years.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.790
There's now an entire generation of Russians
who have grown up not knowing any other political

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.730
reality, who only have a memory of Putin in
power.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.840
In fact, the people, young Russians who will
turn 18, who will become voters and who will

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.790
come to vote for the first time in March of
2018 for the presidential election, or the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.170
so-called presidential election, I should
say, these people will have been born under

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.409
Vladimir Putin.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.879
This is how long he’s been in power.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:49.360
Of course, back in 1999, I don't think anybody
thought that this is how long it would take.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.680
Most people, even people who are interested
in politics, would follow politics closely,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.730
would have no idea who this guy was.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.819
Some people knew him in St. Petersburg from
his days as deputy mayor there.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.120
Some people knew him from his days as director
of the FSB.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.620
But again, he was somebody who was never prominent
in politics, who had never run for elected

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.620
office in his life.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.370
You’ve got to remember, the first election
Vladimir Putin ran for in his life was election

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.629
for president of Russia.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.469
He’s never run for parliament; he’s never
run for regional legislature, for regional

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:21.469
governor, nothing.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.190
He had no political experience at all.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.840
MICHAEL KIRK - What had he done to distinguish
himself, anything in that period when he’s

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.700
the prime minister and then the anointed candidate
of Boris Yeltsin?

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.530
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - Well, that was a
very short time, just from August to December.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.510
That time was marked by a complete political
shift in Russia of that time, a political

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.599
shift caused and spearheaded by the second
war in Chechnya, which Mr. Putin was the author

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.269
and initiator of.

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:02.379
Just a few weeks after he became prime minister,
we had a very suspicious [spate] of apartment

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:09.510
bombings across Russia; in Moscow, in Buinaksk,
in Volgodonsk, apartment buildings are blown

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.530
up, supposedly by Chechen terrorists.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.749
This is what was officially announced as the
reason for those terrorist attacks.

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:21.739
Hundreds of people were killed, innocent people,
civilians just sleeping in their homes.

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.690
This, of course, led to a public backlash,
understandably, against the supposed perpetrators

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.169
of these terrorist attacks.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.470
This created the conditions and the political
space for the Putin government to go into

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.199
Chechnya and begin a second military campaign
there.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:46.311
There was the original war in Chechnya, [which]
took place from 1994 to 1996 and ended with

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:50.090
a truce and then finally with a peace agreement
in 1997.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.060
When Mr. Putin came to power as prime minister
of Russia in the summer of 1999, there hadn’t

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.620
been war in Chechnya for more than three years
already, but he restarted it.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.370
He sent troops again.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.360
He began a bombing campaign.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:12.030
In these kind of conditions of this mass war
hysteria, of this big scare—again, understandable

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.090
when you have houses, apartment buildings
being blown up randomly in the middle of the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:23.599
night across the country—all of this created
the conditions for somebody who was basically

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:30.629
completely unknown and the party which was
just created literally a few weeks before

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.070
the election was announced.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.190
Just thrown [together] from different pieces,
it was called Unity.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.580
It’s now United Russia, the ruling party,
and it’s led by Vladimir Putin.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.319
Within the space of a few weeks, he went from
being a nobody to winning the parliamentary

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.600
election—his party winning the parliamentary
election in December of 1999 on the back of

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.100
the military campaign in Chechnya, on the
back of this mass hysteria and the demand

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.909
that the government do something, and he appeared
to be doing something.

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.280
He won the parliamentary election in December
and then, of course, as we all know, on New

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.729
Year’s Eve, on Dec. 31, 1999, President
Yeltsin made the surprise announcement that

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.520
he was resigning, stepping down, and Putin
took over as acting president of Russia initially.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.020
In March of 2000, he won the presidential
election.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.419
That was by no means a flawless election,
by the way.

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.889
It’s also important to remember this.

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:32.150
There were credible reports at the time of
ballot stuffing and rewriting of vote tallies

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.540
in several regions, so there were strong doubts
as to whether Mr. Putin actually secured the

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.080
necessary 50 percent of the vote to win in
the first round of the 2000 presidential election.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.330
That was the last thing we had that was at
least close to a competitive election in Russia.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.240
This was March 2000, the presidential election.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.750
As we just talk about parliamentary elections,
this was exactly the same case with presidential.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.400
After 2000, not a single national election
in Russia, parliamentary or presidential,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.919
has been assessed by international monitors
as free and fair and conforming to democratic

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:08.919
standards.

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.520
MICHAEL KIRK - Did you watch the Yeltsin statement?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.520
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - Of course.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.250
MICHAEL KIRK - Can you take me back there
for a moment?

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.370
What was that?

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.409
Was it a surprise?

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:18.759
What was it like for you?

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.659
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - It was, of course,
a surprise.

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:30.789
It was very sad as well, because I'm from
the generation whose first really vivid and

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:36.460
conscious political memory was August ‘91,
the democratic revolution in Russia; those

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:42.740
three days that ended the Soviet regime and
revolutionized our country in so many ways.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.699
I remember those three days in August very
well, though I was only 10 years old at the

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:46.699
time.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:51.840
When something like this is happening in your
country, you notice, and you remember.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:00.680
The lesson that I took from those events and
that I know I'll have for the rest of my life

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:09.090
is that however strong the dictatorship and
the repression, if enough dedicated people

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.629
are prepared to stand their ground and stand
up for their liberty and their rights and

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:19.039
their dignity, they will prevail, as we saw
in August ‘91.

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:23.092
The plotters of the attempted coup, the leadership
of the Soviet Communist Party and the KGB,

00:08:23.092 --> 00:08:24.092
had everything.

00:08:24.092 --> 00:08:25.092
They were the state.

00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:29.120
They had the whole apparatus, the whole machine
of repression, the whole machine of propaganda—the

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.700
KGB, the police, the army, the tanks.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.730
Of course they had the tanks, which they sent
physically to occupy central Moscow.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:45.480
And the people, Russians, Muscovites who stood
up against that coup had nothing except their

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.600
dignity and their determination to defend
their rights and their freedoms.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.780
They went out and stood in the streets of
Moscow in front of the tanks for three days

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.380
and three nights, and the tanks stopped and
turned away.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.390
That's a very powerful lesson.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.340
And Boris Yeltsin was a key figure in that.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.500
He was a hero of that democratic revolution,
no questions about it.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.150
He was the one who stood on top of that tank
as a symbol, as a powerful symbol of the resistance

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:14.140
against those plotters, against that coup,
and he, of course, led Russia for a very difficult,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.160
very tumultuous period, the 1990s.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.260
We had many economic difficulties; we had
many problems in the Caucuses; we had many

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.460
problems with the whole reformation of the
state.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:34.080
A lot of people experienced hardships in the
1990s under that government.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.070
But also, it was under Boris Yeltsin that
we had genuine independent media in Russia,

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.960
that we had free democratic and competitive
elections in Russia, both parliamentary and

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.910
presidential; that we had strong regionals.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.620
We had real federalism; we had real pluralism.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:56.050
This was one of the very few periods in Russian
history when we had democracy and political

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.780
freedom.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.980
Boris Yeltsin, for all his shortcomings and
all his mistakes, he was an absolutely historic

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.160
figure in Russian history, and I think history
will remember him very kindly, much kinder

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.000
than people at the time thought of him.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.900
I remember this was a very sad moment when
he resigned.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:26.310
Of course nobody really knew what was coming
next because nobody really knew who this guy

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.310
was.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.400
Of course you remember the beginning of 2000,
at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trudy

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.210
Rubin of Philadelphia Inquirer asked her famous
question to a panel of Russian politicians

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.940
and experts: “Who is Mr. Putin?”

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.340
There was a pause, silence in the room for
a few seconds, and then everybody started

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.730
laughing, because nobody knew who this guy
was.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.920
Here he was, the head of state of the largest
country in the world, one of the two largest

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.700
nuclear powers in the world, a member of the
G-8, a member of the United Nations Security

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.320
Council, and nobody knew who this guy was.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.390
Of course we know now very well.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.910
I must say, for those who are willing to see
and for those who are willing to notice, there

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.890
were signs at the time of who this guy will
be.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.690
I'll give you an example.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:16.620
I actually remember the day when I realized
who Vladimir Putin was.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.190
This was December the 20th, 1999.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.090
It was 11 days before he would become acting
president.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.120
He was still prime minister; Boris Yeltsin
was still president.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.440
That day, Mr. Putin did two things.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.690
Dec. 20 is the Chekist Day, the day of the
founding of the Cheka, the KGB, the Soviet

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:41.300
secret police, still, by the way, astonishingly,
still officially commemorated in Russia today.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:50.490
On that day, he went and unveiled a memorial
plaque to his mentor, Yuri Andropov, on the

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.370
KGB headquarters in Moscow, in Lubyanka Square.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.800
Yuri Andropov was the longtime chairman of
the Soviet KGB, infamous for having set up

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.310
the Fifth Directorate, which was a special
directorate within the KGB tasked with suppressing

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.310
political dissent.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.510
He was going after dissidents in the Soviet
Union.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:13.060
He was almost infamous for setting up the
practice of punitive psychiatry.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.230
This is when dissidents were declared mentally
insane and committed to psychiatric hospitals.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.620
If you were against the Soviet regime, you
were declared to be insane.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.670
This is what Andropov did.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.940
And on December the 20th, 1999, Putin opened
a memorial plaque to Andropov in deference

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.460
and respect to him.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:38.240
That same evening, he addressed a meeting,
a gathering of KGB veterans in Moscow, and

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.110
he told them publicly, in front of cameras,
with a smile on his face, he said, "I can

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:49.330
report to you that a group of FSB officers
assigned to work undercover in the government

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.210
of the Russian Federation are fulfilling their
mission," and everybody started clapping.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.250
Some people, I remember still, thought at
the time that this was a quaint joke.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.591
Of course now we know it was anything but.

00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:03.300
But that was the day—there were many others.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.770
I'm not saying this was the only thing.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.330
Of course, for a lot of people it was the
war in Chechnya that really showed who Mr.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.690
Putin was, and that was even before that.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.700
That was in the summer of 1999.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:18.270
I just happen to remember that day really
vividly because Russia is a country of symbols,

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:27.050
and if you begin your tenure by honoring somebody
like Andropov, a symbol of Soviet totalitarian

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.110
repression, that's not a very good sign for
an upcoming administration.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.980
MICHAEL KIRK - … We spend a little time
in the film, or will spend a little time in

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.870
the film, on [the school siege in] Beslan
and what happened there as another marker

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.990
of something.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.480
Tell us that story.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:52.360
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - Well, first of all,
I think it's important to recall that the

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.580
first victim of Vladimir Putin's regime was
independent media.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:03.910
In fact, four days after he was inaugurated
as president in May of 2000, four days after

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:09.620
that, he sent armed operatives from the prosecutor
general's service and the tax police to raid

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.070
the offices of Media-Most, which was at the
time the largest independent media holding

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:19.810
in Russia, the parent company of NTV, the
most popular independent television network

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:25.360
in Russia that was known for its hard-hitting
political analysis and satire and criticism

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.890
of the authorities, including of Vladimir
Putin himself.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:36.350
Within the first couple of years of his rule,
Putin went after every nationwide independent

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:41.890
television network, either shutting them down
or taking them under state control, which

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:42.890
is what happened to NTV.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.900
Then they shut down TV 6.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.710
He shut down TVS in 2003.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.180
This was the last privately owned nationwide
television channel that he closed.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.530
And of course it was very logical why he began
with this, because a lot of the other things

00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:03.130
that he would go on to do would be impossible
if he had a real independent media that would

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.240
hold the regime and its actions to account.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.860
It would be much more difficult, for instance,
to rig elections on the scale that Putin has

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.440
been doing it if things were open and openly
discussed in the media.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.020
It would be much more difficult to do what
he did with Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the Yukos

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:25.450
oil company, making this showcase that the
business community should keep out of politics

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:30.430
by imprisoning the richest man in Russia,
who dared to expose government corruption

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.930
and support opposition parties and society
groups.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.140
Something like this would have been much more
difficult to do if he had all sides represented

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.860
in the public view.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:47.080
The corruption, the issue that we keep talking
about in Russia, especially in the last several

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.060
years, the absolutely mammoth, overwhelming
corruption and nepotism that Putin's regime

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.780
has created, needless to say, that would have
been more difficult had there been genuine

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.230
independent media on a large scale, as there
had been in Russia in the 1990s.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:11.610
And of course, the case of Beslan shows why
it was so important for Putin to silence those

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:16.190
independent media voices right at the beginning
of his rule, because we can certainly not

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:23.990
imagine that had there been real genuine media
coverage of the events in Beslan and the hostage

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.010
crisis in Beslan, had there been a nationwide
television network that would have honestly

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.470
covered what was going on, I think it’s
impossible to imagine that the president of

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.990
Russia could have given the order to attack,
to storm a school where children were being

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.380
held as hostages and so many of these children
were killed as a result of the decision he

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.700
took.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:49.990
I think it's in the context of the already
solidified authoritarian, undemocratic regime

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.160
which had already been in place by the time
the Beslan terrorist attack happened in September

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.100
of 2004 that I think we have to look at the
whole of this thing.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:05.610
MICHAEL KIRK - And then the act of essentially
disbanding the governors as a further political

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:06.610
consolidation of power.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:11.579
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - ... I'm a historian
by training, so I always do try to find analogies,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.140
because most of these things have happened
before.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:20.950
And I think the way Vladimir Putin consolidated
his power in Russia in the early 2000s was

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:27.059
very similar to the way Benito Mussolini consolidated
his power in Italy in the early 1920s.

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:33.539
Mussolini’s advice was to pluck the chicken
feather by feather to lessen the squawking.

00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:35.009
That's how he put it.

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:38.559
In other words, don’t try to do it all in
one day, all at the same time.

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:42.409
Do it incrementally, gradually, carefully,
step by step.

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:47.480
This is how Mussolini did it, and this is
how Putin did it.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.929
Putin first went after independent media,
independent television, and destroyed them.

00:17:51.929 --> 00:17:56.279
He then went after the opposition in parliament
and after the electoral process, beginning

00:17:56.279 --> 00:18:01.559
to rig elections and booting out the democratic
opposition from the Russian parliament in

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:05.490
2003, rendering parliament a rubber stamp
for his initiatives.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:11.039
He then went after the business community
with the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky,

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:16.629
Russia's richest man, who had the tenacity
to expose government corruption and support

00:18:16.629 --> 00:18:17.809
opposition parties in elections.

00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:20.630
That was a clear message of, “Don’t do
this.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:27.480
If you're going to do this, this is what's
going to happen to you,” a final step in

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:33.090
the transformation of what was a flawed and
problematic but basically a democratic political

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:39.220
system in Russia when Putin came to power
to a full-blown authoritarian regime that

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.659
we have today.

00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:47.009
The last major step to that was after the
Beslan terrorist attack, when Putin cynically

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:54.750
used the terrorist attack, the hostage crisis,
to abolish direct elections for regional governors

00:18:54.750 --> 00:19:02.030
in Russia and to also change rules in parliamentary
elections, after which the last remaining

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.400
few independent lawmakers were thrown out
of the Russian parliament.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.419
Parliament finally became, as its own speaker
famously, or infamously, said, “Parliament

00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:13.730
is not a place for discussion.”

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.240
That's what Boris Gryzlov, Putin's party colleague
from United Russia and former speaker of the

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.539
Russian State Duma [the Russian Assembly]
said.

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:23.720
I think that's going to be one of the quotes
that defines the Putin era politically in

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720
Russia.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.070
Parliament is not a place for discussion.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.529
You can't put it any better than he did.

00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:35.629
MICHAEL KIRK - … Let's talk about the things
that worry him ’03, 04, ’05, ’06.

00:19:35.629 --> 00:19:42.110
The color revolutions …&nbsp; Help me just understand
what's going on with him and why he fears

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.000
his own population.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.620
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - Well, a lot of this
is a propaganda image created by Putin state

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.890
TV, this message that when people rise up
to defend their rights and their freedoms

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.230
and to protest against rigged elections, for
example, that this is not the people themselves

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:07.110
rising up; this is all instigated and manipulated
from Washington, from the State Department,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.110
from God knows where.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.179
He’s been saying these things openly.

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:12.850
You remember when the mass protests broke
out in Russia against Putin's rule at the

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:18.470
end of 2011 after the rigged parliamentary
elections of that year, Putin openly blamed

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.190
it on the U.S. government, which was absolutely
mind-boggling.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:26.960
It shows you, also, it opens up a little bit
of his paranoid KGB mindset, which shouldn’t

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.450
be surprising because that's what he was taught.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.070
That's what he did all of his life.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.340
MICHAEL KIRK - What's the KGB mindset?

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:41.610
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - We all have some
kind of education and background and experience.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.260
Some people are educated to be physicists
or chemists or historians or mathematicians

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.309
or economists.

00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:53.009
They all have things they learn, things they
do, their own trade, their own knowledge,

00:20:53.009 --> 00:20:55.580
their own expertise.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.889
What do you think they teach at the Andropov
Institute of the KGB?

00:20:58.889 --> 00:21:04.940
They teach you to recruit; they teach you
to lie; they teach you to subvert; they teach

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.260
you to lead double lives.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:13.149
This is what this guy has done for his entire
life ever since he turned up at the door of

00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:19.720
the KGB directorate in Leningrad voluntarily
after school to go to work for that organization.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:28.200
That also says a lot about someone who in
the 1970s, at the height of the totalitarian

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.860
era, would openly volunteer to go and work
for the KGB.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.210
There's a lot of this mindset that he still
shows very often.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:45.049
For instance, when he blames the mass protests
on some foreign governments, some schemes,

00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:48.480
that's actually another thing, I think, to
do with his KGB mindset.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:55.409
It’s genuinely difficult for somebody like
that to understand that not everything is

00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:58.840
manipulated and bought and purchased.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.230
Sometimes people are just genuinely fed up,
and they go out to the streets because that's

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.899
the only way left for them to be heard, and
they want to defend themselves and their dignity

00:22:06.899 --> 00:22:07.899
and their freedom.

00:22:07.899 --> 00:22:12.299
He should have really got this message by
now that it’s possible.

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:15.980
He’s seen it in East Germany at the end
of the ‘80s when he was stationed there.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:21.629
He saw it, of course, in Russia itself in
‘91 during our democratic revolution.

00:22:21.629 --> 00:22:28.249
He saw it again, very unpleasantly for him,
in 2011 and 2012 during the largest opposition

00:22:28.249 --> 00:22:32.620
demonstrations under Putin's rule in Russia,
when tens of thousands of people went to the

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.520
streets across the country to protest against
him.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:43.000
But you asked what other things he’s most
afraid of or most uncomfortable with.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.249
I think there are only two things that Vladimir
Putin is genuinely afraid of.

00:22:50.249 --> 00:22:53.860
The first is mass protests on the streets
of Russia.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.250
That makes him really nervous, and for good
reason, because he’s seen what that can

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:03.149
do to dictators and to corrupt strongmen in
other countries, including former communist

00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:05.600
countries like Serbia, like Georgia, like
Ukraine.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.235
He’s seen where this can lead, and he's
[mortally afraid] of this.

00:23:09.235 --> 00:23:14.370
You can see this reaction both in 2011 and
2012 during the first wave of mass protest

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:19.490
against the Putin regime and now, in 2017,
since the start of this new protest movement

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.440
at the beginning of this year, how nervous
the regime has been about this and how much

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.750
of a crackdown they tried to engage in against
this peaceful opposition movement.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.220
So that's the first thing.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:39.070
The second thing they're [mortally afraid]
of are individual targeted Western sanctions

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:46.090
against officials and oligarchs in the Putin
regime.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.750
We already talked about the many similarities
that exist between the Putin regime and the

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.499
Soviet regime, and there are very many similarities.

00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:57.249
We have political prisoners in Russia again
today.

00:23:57.249 --> 00:23:59.090
We have no free and fair elections.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.850
We have censorship in the media and so on
and so forth.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:07.919
But for all the many similarities, political
similarities, there's one important difference,

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:15.669
crucial difference, in terms of the nature
of the group of people and the regime in power.

00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:21.179
While members of the Soviet Politburo were
jailing dissidents and muzzling independent

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:26.940
opinions and putting people in prison in psychiatric
hospitals, they didn't keep their money in

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.179
Western banks.

00:24:29.179 --> 00:24:31.049
They didn't send their children to study in
Western schools.

00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:35.429
They didn't buy homes and yachts in Western
countries.

00:24:35.429 --> 00:24:37.640
People in the Putin regime do that.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.559
They want to rule inside Russia like it’s
a Third World dictatorship, denying people

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:49.480
the basic rights and freedoms, but they themselves
want to use the privileges and the freedoms

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.330
and the opportunities of the Western world,
of Western democracies, for themselves and

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.399
for their families.

00:24:56.399 --> 00:24:59.649
They want to steal in Russia and spend in
the West.

00:24:59.649 --> 00:25:04.129
This is their modus vivendi; this is how these
people live.

00:25:04.129 --> 00:25:09.629
When beginning in 2012 with the Magnitsky
Act being passed in the U.S. Congress, by

00:25:09.629 --> 00:25:15.519
overwhelming bipartisan majorities, with the
West beginning to finally put an end to this

00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:21.399
impunity and finally beginning to hold these
people accountable for what they do and what

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:28.830
they have done, and declaring and laying down
this principle, very simple principle—that

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:37.179
if you trample and abuse the most basic principles
of a civilized world, you should not be allowed

00:25:37.179 --> 00:25:40.779
to enjoy the privileges the civilized world
has to offer.

00:25:40.779 --> 00:25:42.390
That really is not a very complicated principle.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:45.600
It's very simple, and it’s also the right
thing to do.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.990
Since the West has finally begun to do this—in
many ways because of the efforts of Russian

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.419
opposition leaders like Boris Nemtsov, who
was instrumental in convincing the U.S. Congress

00:25:56.419 --> 00:26:02.350
to pass the Magnitsky Act over opposition
from the Obama administration, by the way—this

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:06.679
really was a nightmare for Putin's Kremlin.

00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:11.919
We have seen all the efforts that Putin's
Kremlin has engaged in over the last several

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:18.059
years to try to stop and undermine and overturn
this process of introducing targeted personal

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:19.059
sanctions.

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:24.230
He did it both officially and unofficially
just a few hours after his inauguration in

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:28.119
May of 2012, for his current presidential
term.

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:32.230
He signed an order, an official order to a
foreign ministry of Russia tasking it with

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.019
trying to stop the Magnitsky Act.

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:37.400
This was put on paper as official Russian
presidential policy.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:45.350
He has also engaged in blackmail to try to
undermine the Magnitsky Act by linking it

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:51.159
to continued adoptions of Russian orphans
by U.S. citizens.

00:26:51.159 --> 00:26:54.059
Absolutely mind-boggling if you think about
it.

00:26:54.059 --> 00:27:00.029
Putin retaliated for targeted individual sanctions
on human rights abusers who were prevented

00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:08.679
from doing their Christmas shopping on New
York's Fifth Avenue by denying Russian orphans,

00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:13.330
Russian kids, many of them disabled Russian
kids, basically a chance in life, saying,

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:19.499
“Let them rot in horrible conditions in
Russian orphanages, and I'm going to ban their

00:27:19.499 --> 00:27:23.649
adoptions by U.S. citizens because the U.S.
has banned our U.S. human rights abusers from

00:27:23.649 --> 00:27:24.649
going.”

00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:33.230
If you need a moral portrait of the Putin
regime, that's the best example.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:37.600
As [the] prominent Russian columnist Valery
Panyushkin said at the time, there are only

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:44.520
two organizations in the world that use their
own children as human shields against their

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.520
enemies.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.879
One is Hamas, and the other is United Russia
Party, led by Vladimir Putin.

00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:54.000
Of course, all these stories that we keep
hearing just in the last few days about the

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.340
meeting at Trump Tower in June of 2016, I
think a lot of people are discussing all the

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.370
other aspects of this meeting, but not enough
attention is paid to the actual substance

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.370
of it.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:07.779
The reason it took place is because these
two unofficial proxies acting for Putin's

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:13.049
regime for the Kremlin, they tried to secure
this meeting in order to try to undermine

00:28:13.049 --> 00:28:15.220
and overturn the Magnitsky Act.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.309
This has been absolutely central.

00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:23.080
So the two biggest fears, biggest nightmares
of the Putin regime, are mass protests on

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.119
the streets of Russia, mass protests by the
people of Russia against his regime, which

00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:30.740
we are increasingly seeing since the beginning
of this year, and I think we’ll see only

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.869
more of in the coming months and years; and
the second one is those targeted personal

00:28:35.869 --> 00:28:40.230
individual sanctions against crooks and human
rights abusers in Putin regime.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.179
Personal [sanctions], this is very important—not
sanctions on Russia.

00:28:43.179 --> 00:28:48.700
An entire country should not be blamed for
the actions of a small, unelected group of

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.450
people in the Kremlin.

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.929
Responsibility should be assigned where it
is due, to those people who actually perpetrate

00:28:53.929 --> 00:28:55.220
these abuses.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.530
This is why the Magnitsky Act was so groundbreaking.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:02.490
It introduced this concept that you can sanction
not a whole country, not even the government

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:08.380
of that country, but you can actually sanction
those specific people who are engaged in those

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.940
abuses and in that corruption and in those
human rights violations.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.039
That was very honorable and principled, as
well as very effective.

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:22.852
MICHAEL KIRK - … Explain his [Putin's] response
to Hillary's statements that the [2011] election

00:29:22.852 --> 00:29:32.279
had been rigged and people should hit the
streets.

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:34.200
What is his reaction to that?

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.940
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - This goes to this
whole mindset of trying to see conspiracies

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:47.009
everywhere and this paranoid idea that everything
that happens, there are some secret masterminds

00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:48.210
standing behind it.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:55.029
He just cannot accept the idea that so many
people in Russia are fed up with his rule,

00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:59.399
are unhappy about his rule; that they're fed
up with being treated like a doormat; that

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:04.389
they want to be citizens of their own country,
as opposed to voiceless subjects; and that

00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:10.179
people can actually be unhappy about their
votes being stolen and the elections being

00:30:10.179 --> 00:30:11.179
rigged.

00:30:11.179 --> 00:30:12.369
That's what happened in 2011.

00:30:12.369 --> 00:30:14.690
That's just first of all, just talk about
this.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:21.389
What happened in 2011 was an absolutely blatant
and brazen rigging of a parliamentary election.

00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:23.390
This was not the first time a Russian election
was rigged.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.360
This happened many times under Putin.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.789
But this was the first time this was done
so openly and brazenly and unashamedly, and

00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:32.409
they didn't even try to deny it.

00:30:32.409 --> 00:30:36.881
Because this was already the age of the Internet
and social media, all this information, these

00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:43.379
videos and photos of ballot stuffing and rewriting
of vote tallies, spread in a matter of hours.

00:30:43.379 --> 00:30:47.809
Just a few days after that election, more
than 100,000 people came out to the center

00:30:47.809 --> 00:30:52.289
of Moscow just across the river from the Kremlin
in Bolotnaya Square to say: “No, enough.

00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:53.390
We are fed up with this.”

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:59.769
This was the largest demonstration held in
Russia, in Moscow, since the democratic revolution

00:30:59.769 --> 00:31:01.730
of August 1991.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.700
It was followed by an even larger one on Andrei
Sakharov Avenue just a few days later at the

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.200
end of December 2011.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:14.559
Of course Putin was terrified, and his regime
was terrified, and they responded initially

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:20.509
by quickly issuing some political concessions
to the protesters; for instance, reinstating

00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:24.109
direct elections for regional governors that
they’d abolished after the terrorist attack

00:31:24.109 --> 00:31:25.460
in Beslan.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.580
Remember in 2010, Dmitry Medvedev, who was
then caretaker president, taking Putin's place

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.940
while he was constitutionally barred from
serving as president for a term, Medvedev

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.970
said publicly that he was asked when the Russian
government is going to reinstate direct elections

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.299
for regional governors, and he said not in
100 years.

00:31:43.299 --> 00:31:49.159
Of course a year after that, when 100,000
people went out to the streets of Moscow and

00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:53.929
stood across the river from the Kremlin, it
took him a few days to reinstate direct elections

00:31:53.929 --> 00:31:54.929
for governors.

00:31:54.929 --> 00:31:58.749
They did a few other small things like they
registered a couple of opposition parties;

00:31:58.749 --> 00:32:00.200
they released a few political prisoners.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.380
So they hurriedly began issuing some concessions.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:10.070
Then they went into crackdown mode, and they
began arresting people and trying people,

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.960
including opposition activists and opposition
leaders.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:17.070
There are still people sitting in prisons
today, more than five years after those protests,

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.070
for taking part in those protests in Bolotnaya
Square.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:26.350
And of course he began to blame the West and
Western governments, and in particular the

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:30.240
U.S. administration, for instigating those
protests and standing behind them.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.989
This is a continuation of the same line they’ve
used with regard to the so-called color revolutions

00:32:34.989 --> 00:32:38.289
in other post-communist countries like Serbia,
like Georgia, like Ukraine.

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:44.419
That was the message, the propaganda message,
that this was all done by Western puppet masters

00:32:44.419 --> 00:32:46.619
to try to get at him, at Putin.

00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:51.119
This was the message he repeated with regard
to the Russian protest in Moscow and other

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:53.890
cities in Russia in 2011 and 2012.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:58.970
When Hillary Clinton made that statement,
first of all, she didn't say anything particularly

00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:59.970
revolutionary.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:04.629
She just repeated what the observers from
the Organization for Security and Cooperation

00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:09.049
in Europe had stated, and that was that this
election was not free, not fair and not democratic.

00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:10.890
This was just stating a basic fact.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.249
There was nothing really groundbreaking about
this.

00:33:13.249 --> 00:33:18.850
She just honestly said what the OSCE observers
had concluded.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.279
Of course Putin was furious, and the Kremlin
was furious.

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:25.210
They said, “This is interference in our
internal affairs,” and so on and so forth,

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:29.480
a favorite phrase, by the way, that they use,
despite the fact that this phrase is a lie

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:34.940
because Russia is a full member of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.289
is the United States, as is every country
in the European Union.

00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:44.450
The rules of that organization and the statutes
of that organization clearly state, black

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:50.230
and white, that matters relating to the rule
of law, to human rights and to democracy,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.399
including election standards, cannot be considered
internal affairs.

00:33:53.399 --> 00:33:56.830
They are subject are international obligations
and international concern.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:01.130
So when Vladimir Putin and [Foreign Minister]
Sergei Lavrov are saying that these are interferences

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:06.519
into internal affairs, they are—how shall
I say it most diplomatically?—they are misspeaking.

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:09.679
But this is what he did; this was his reaction.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.400
There's nothing particularly new about this.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:19.740
This is what he does when he’s under siege
politically: he begins blaming people for

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.820
his problems.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:31.640
Instead of just admitting and accepting that
there are increasing numbers of Russian people

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:37.000
who are unhappy and fed up with his rule and
are beginning to protest against him, he’s

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.200
saying that these are all conspiracies masterminded
by some governments in the West.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:47.970
Pretty ironic, actually, with regard to the
Obama administration, because the Obama administration

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:53.600
had been the one who declared a reset in relations
with Putin regime.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.750
President Obama had praised Putin publicly
as somebody who’s done tremendous work on

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:01.200
behalf of the Russian people, and Hillary
Clinton was the one who pressed the reset

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.200
button.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.360
There's also a very important lesson, I think,
in all this.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:11.470
Both previous U.S. presidents, and technically
Bill Clinton was the first president who coincided

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.310
with Putin, but he was only there—he was
basically a lame duck by then.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.740
It was his last year or so; he didn't really
have a chance to do much.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:23.480
But both U.S. presidents who had their full
terms under Vladimir Putin, George W. Bush

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:28.540
and Barack Obama, tried to be friendly with
him, as we well know.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:33.610
We remember George W. Bush looking into Putin's
eyes and getting a sense of his soul and praising

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.090
Putin as a true reformer.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:40.440
We remember Barack Obama declaring a reset
in relations with the Putin regime and praising

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.320
Putin as somebody who’s done tremendous
work on behalf of the Russian people.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:53.240
… This was very naive and not very wise
and farsighted to try to have a friendly relationship

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.810
with a corrupt authoritarian regime.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:04.120
There cannot be a convergence of interests
or even a real relationship based on mutual

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.410
trust and mutual understanding between, on
the one hand, a constitutional democracy—that

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:17.200
is the United States—and a corrupt authoritarian
dictatorship that is Vladimir Putin's regime.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:25.010
And if history teaches us anything, it's that
making short-term, cynical deals with authoritarian

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.740
governments is not a good strategy for a democratic
nation.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:34.610
I think both George W. Bush and Barack Obama
found this the hard way.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:40.630
MICHAEL KIRK - One of the moments that we
spent some time on surrounds the events in

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:56.930
Crimea and Ukraine, assessing in some ways
Obama's government's arguments, internal arguments,

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:05.190
about whether they should arm the Ukrainians
against the onslaught of the Russian troops;

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:12.780
whether Obama should have confronted more
forcefully with at least lethal defensive

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:20.000
weapons Putin's taking of Crimea, initiation
of conflict.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.780
The argument inside the American government,
forcefully made by Victoria Nuland and many

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:33.180
others, was we have to draw the line somewhere,
and this could be and should be a great human

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.890
rights place to draw the line.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:40.340
Let’s do it because somebody has to draw
the line and face him.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.570
What is your sense of how Putin would have
reacted if Obama would have been forceful?

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.740
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - You know what I think?

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.010
Probably 2014 was a little bit late in trying
to draw the line against Vladimir Putin.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:38:00.660
When Vladimir Putin came to power at the end
of 1999, beginning of 2000, he tried to tread

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.870
very carefully at first.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:08.730
He was testing both Russian public opinion
and international public opinion and the views

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:13.490
of Western leaders and Western governments
to what he was doing and the reaction to what

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.500
he was doing.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.220
And there was no reaction.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:24.510
When he went after and shut down and destroyed
independent national television networks in

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.650
Russia, there was no reaction.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:32.720
In fact, just a few weeks after the Putin
government seized control of NTV, the largest

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:40.180
independent TV channel in Russia, he had that
famous summit meeting with George W. Bush

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.210
when he looked into his eyes and got a sense
of his soul.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.920
This was a few weeks after the takeover of
NTV.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:51.370
Two days after the Putin government pulled
the plug on the last independent nationwide

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:57.360
television network in Russia TVS, in June
2003, two days after that, Putin was treated

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:03.010
to a royal reception, literally, of the London
Guild Hall with the queen of England and with

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.820
Tony Blair, the British prime minister.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.760
He was praised, and it was all pomp and circumstance.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:15.690
I think he could be forgiven for getting the
wrong message that Western leaders really

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.360
didn't care about this.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:25.060
One thing to understand about how Russian
political history works and how Russian political

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:33.830
dynamics work, certainly in the modern era,
is that there was a direct correlation between

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:40.200
the domestic nature of the regime and the
way he behaves abroad, the way he behaves

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.800
outside of Russian borders.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:49.090
Domestic repression is inevitably followed,
sooner or later, by external aggression.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.250
This is absolutely logical if you think about
it.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.980
What's the reason for expecting a government
that violates the rights of its own people

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.750
and that breaks its own laws, why would you
expect it to then abide by international norms

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:05.010
and respect the interests of other countries
or international borders?

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:12.230
As Putin grew bolder and bolder and consolidated
his control domestically, and as he basically

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:16.810
saw no reaction from the international community,
all of his crackdown on the independence of

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:22.900
the media, all of his crackdown on parliament
and his rigging of elections, and the Yukos

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:30.060
case and the abolition of regional governors,
and this authoritarian consolidation at home,

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.050
he grew bolder and bolder and more assertive.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:38.390
And he thought, as he could be forgiven for
doing, why not go on, and why not do even

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:39.970
more things?

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:46.610
I think those people, those political leaders
in Western countries, who had chosen to ignore

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:54.230
the crackdown on independence of the media
and the rigging of elections and the destruction

00:40:54.230 --> 00:41:01.370
of democratic institutions in Russia, they
woke up one day to see a violation of international

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.770
borders in Europe, to see the first territorial
annexation in Europe since the Second World

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:10.120
War, which is what Putin did in Crimea in
2014.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.900
These are all directly linked.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:20.660
Had the international community and had the
leaders of Western democracies taken a more

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:27.260
principled stand earlier on in Putin's rule,
instead of praising him and trying to engage

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.560
him and be friendly with him, as he was destroying
democracy in Russia, I think had they taken

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:40.550
a more principled line earlier on, we would
not be seeing the excesses that we are seeing

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.480
today, including violations of international
borders.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:48.020
MICHAEL KIRK - So it was too late for Obama
to step up by then.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.150
Is that what you're saying?

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:57.572
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - If we're talking
about drawing lines against the Putin regime,

00:41:57.572 --> 00:42:02.920
there have been so many lines that failed
to be drawn after 2000.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.800
I'm not saying that if you didn't begin to
draw lines at the beginning, you should just

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800
go on not drawing.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.290
I'm not saying that.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:17.930
But I'm just wondering how effective it would
be to begin drawing a line against an aggressive

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:21.590
dictator in the 15th year of him being in
power.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:27.150
MICHAEL KIRK - It also seems—we haven’t
talked at all about this—but it seems that

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:40.510
Putin, the former KGB man and asymmetrical
warrior, …&nbsp; was equipped by 2015, 2014,

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:49.060
in there around Ukraine with what has been
called hybrid warfare tactics and capabilities

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.010
from hard power to cyber power to information
war.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:59.710
It looks almost to us like what Ukraine is
is a road test for that kind of warfare.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.570
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - That also has a long
history.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:10.010
The KGB, Putin's alma mater, professional
alma mater, has been involved in so-called

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.530
active measures for years and decades.

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:18.510
The Soviet regime is not just engaged in actual
physical war.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:23.110
They’ve done a lot of the clandestine stuff
and active measures against the opponents,

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.110
perceived opponents.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.530
So I think that's certainly true, what you're
saying.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.290
There's nothing new in this, too.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:37.680
In terms of Ukraine, I think it’s also important
to note the fact that the main motivation

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:45.100
for Putin's aggression against Ukraine that
began in 2014 was not geopolitical or post-imperialist

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.310
or foreign policy-driven.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:48.850
It was domestic.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:56.270
He really didn't enjoy the precedent of a
corrupt authoritarian strongman in a country

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:03.080
so close to Russia culturally, historically,
linguistically, you name it, as Ukraine is

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:09.790
being overthrown by a popular uprising, by
a popular democratic revolution.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:15.940
He really didn't like those images of Mr.
[Viktor] Yanukovych hastily boarding his helicopter

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:22.100
to flee as hundreds of thousands of people
are demonstrating on the streets of the capital.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:30.990
I think his overarching goal behind his aggression
against Ukraine in 2014 was to try to prevent

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:38.740
the success of the democratic European experiment
in Ukraine, to try to crush the Maidan in

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:44.710
Kiev before it will become a model and an
inspiration for a Maidan in Moscow.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:49.820
This is why he has done and continues to do
what he does against Ukraine.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:57.740
In a way, what Putin is doing in Ukraine is
a proxy war against Russian society in trying

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:03.320
to prevent the same political developments
that happened in Ukraine.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:12.220
MICHAEL KIRK - Let's go to the American election
in 2016.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:19.140
When you first heard about the allegations
that it was Russia meddling in our election,

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.860
what did you think?

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:27.380
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - I thought, first
of all, let’s be accurate with the terms—not

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.660
Russia but the Putin regime and Russian officials
of the Russian government, absolutely.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.410
MICHAEL KIRK - The Kremlin, whatever you want
to call it.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.410
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - Absolutely.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:39.630
I was not at all surprised, because the Putin
regime has had a long history of meddling

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.940
in elections, first of all, of course, in
Russian elections.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.290
This is how they began.

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:51.810
One of the first targets of the Putin regime
has been the electoral process in Russia.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:58.290
Since he came to power all those years ago,
we have not had a free and fair and democratic

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.690
national election in Russia, not one.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:04.590
This is not me saying it; this is according
to the reports from international monitors.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:09.720
He’s been meddling with the Russian electoral
process for years.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.550
He has been meddling in the electoral process
in other countries for years.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:15.550
And we know all of this.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:23.150
Look at what they’ve been doing in Ukraine,
in Georgia, in Moldova and other countries.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:31.300
Since he’s been doing it, again, with almost
no reaction, including from the international

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:40.110
community, then in his logic, in a dictator’s
logic, why not continue doing it and why not

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:45.410
go for the gold, as it were, and try to do
in the U.S. what he’s done before in Ukraine

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:47.030
and Georgia?

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:54.510
MICHAEL KIRK -&nbsp; … Tell me about the death
of Boris Nemtsov and what you think happened,

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.330
where it fits into this larger story we've
been discussing.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:05.980
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - In terms of the larger
story, we know that there's been a very high

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:13.590
mortality rate in the last several years among
the people who have crossed the path of Vladimir

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:18.570
Putin's Kremlin: independent journalists,
anti-corruption campaigners, opposition activists,

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.640
opposition leaders.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.280
Many people have died, some in strange and
unexplained deaths, others just straight-out

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.570
assassinations.

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:33.900
The assassination of Boris Nemtsov was the
most brazen, the most high-profile political

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:41.740
assassination in modern Russia, and the political
responsibility for this lies squarely with

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.330
Vladimir Putin and his regime.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:50.820
When the leader of the opposition is assassinated
in the shadow of the Kremlin just 200 yards

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:57.540
from the Kremlin Wall in what is probably
the most well-guarded and secure location,

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.970
not just in Moscow but probably in the whole
of Europe, the political responsibility for

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.450
this lies with the regime, with the atmosphere
that's created over the years, including with

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:13.990
its propaganda, where political opponents
of Mr. Putin are vilified and denounced as

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:18.520
traitors and foreign agents and enemies of
Russia.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.770
And of course Boris Nemtsov was the most prominent
political opponent of Vladimir Putin.

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:26.610
He was the strongest political opponent of
Vladimir Putin.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:30.010
He was unique in so many ways.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:37.340
First of all, he had a very rare combination
in today’s politics: He had successful government

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:41.040
experience, because he’s been a regional
governor, a very successful one, in the ‘90s.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.560
He worked in the federal government as deputy
prime minister.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.580
He was a member of parliament, leader of the
parliamentary opposition, on the one hand.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:55.010
On the other hand, he had a very good reputation
and background.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:57.680
He never worked for the Putin regime.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.410
He spent years defending democracy and rule
of law in Russia when he could have easily

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.950
chosen to do something easier, like so many
other people have.

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:13.460
So many people who are thought of as democrats
and liberals in Russia back in the ‘90s

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:20.400
when Putin came to power and began doing what
he was doing, they settled for the easy and

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.970
comfortable option, either finding a place
in the regime or in structures close to the

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:30.270
regime or in big business, or in the worst
case leaving the country and settling in the

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.430
safety of exile.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.340
Boris Nemtsov didn't do that.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:39.680
He chose to stay and fight for his country
and for the future of his country against

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:46.950
a kleptocratic, authoritarian regime that
he saw as destroying the future of Russia.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:52.300
And he gave his all to this.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.690
He was the strongest and the best of all of
us.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:59.540
He was an amazing communicator.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:03.820
I worked with him, alongside him, for more
than 15 years.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.310
I've seen him in many different situations.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:11.320
I can tell you, I've not seen anybody like
this.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:19.210
He could speak on the same level and with
the same effectiveness to American and European

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:25.830
parliamentarians and ministers and to a local
saleswoman in the market in the Yaroslavl

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:30.200
region, on the same level with the same effectiveness.

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:36.930
He could come into a room with 500 people,
and you could feel the tension in the air.

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:41.140
You could feel that most of those people are
hostile to him, and not surprising, given

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:46.590
all this propaganda that's been pushed out
on state TV for years against him.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:51.070
When he would speak to those people for an
hour, for two hours, for three hours, taking

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:55.840
questions, arguing back, talking, explaining
his position, after he was done, two-thirds

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.270
of the audience was on his side.

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:59.270
I've never seen this with anyone.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:04.750
He is the only leader of the so-called nonsystemic
opposition in Russia who managed to win an

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.340
election.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.200
In Russia under Vladimir Putin, this isn't
possible.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.990
Nobody else has managed to do this.

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:14.900
Boris Nemtsov won in 2013; he was elected
as a lawmaker in the Yaroslavl region.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:21.110
At the same time, as we already discussed,
he was instrumental in convincing the U.S.

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:26.120
Congress to pass the Magnitsky Act that targeted
individual sanctions against Putin's regime

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.330
and its human rights abusers.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:32.870
Sen. John McCain, one of the chief authors
of the Magnitsky Act, has said publicly on

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:37.360
record there would not be a Magnitsky Act
without Boris Nemtsov.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:45.390
He was the strongest and the most prominent
political opponent that Vladimir Putin and

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:47.600
his regime had, and they were afraid of him.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.060
MICHAEL KIRK - And his murder was a message,
sent a message?

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.910
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - It’s not so much
a message; it’s just depriving the opposition

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:59.680
of its strongest, most prominent and most
effective leader.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.510
It's depriving Russia of, I think, the best
president we could have had.

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:12.460
Of course, Boris Nemtsov had plans to run
in the presidential election in 2018.

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.140
He was elected in 2013 as a lawmaker in Yaroslavl.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:20.500
He was planning to run for the national parliament
in Russia for the State Duma in 2016.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.500
Even with all the fraud and the rigging, just
because of who he was and how he would communicate

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.710
with people and how he would work with people,
he had a good chance of actually winning.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:34.180
Now, as I'm speaking with you, he could have
been back in the national parliament of Russia,

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:41.030
and that would have given him a completely
different status.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:46.520
Because you asked me this question, I'm trying
to answer it the best I can, but I find it

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:50.750
really difficult to actually talk about this
in political-analysis terms.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.050
This is personal for me.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:55.720
Boris Nemtsov was my closest friend.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.740
He’s godfather to my younger daughter; that's
family in Russia.

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:06.160
I know that for so many people, this is personal.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.890
And we're not going to forget, by the way.

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:14.280
I have no doubt that one day, those people
who are behind his assassination, not just

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:20.080
the perpetrators who have just been sentenced
to prison but also the organizers and the

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:25.060
masterminds, those who organized and ordered
this, that these people will face justice

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.660
according to the Russian law.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.610
They will be held responsible under the law;
I have no doubt about this.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.050
MICHAEL KIRK - And what happened to you?

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:39.180
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - If you read my official
discharge papers from Moscow Hospital, it

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.360
was “toxic action by an unidentified substance.”

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.800
That's the official diagnosis.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.690
Translated from medical into human language:
poisoning.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:54.080
They don’t know with what; they're not sure
how this was done.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:54:02.050
But the only thing we know is that twice in
two years, the first in May of 2015 and the

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:11.310
second time in February of 2017, I fell suddenly
and violently ill, both times in Moscow, both

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:17.390
times falling into a coma with multiple organ
failure and with a 5 percent chance to survive.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:22.420
This is what doctors told my wife, both in
2015 and 2017.

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:28.870
It’s only by the grace of God and by the
work of the good doctors in Moscow that I'm

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:30.510
sitting here and speaking with you today.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:33.920
I'm certainly very grateful and certainly
very fortunate.

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.820
I have no doubt that this was an attempt to
kill.

00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:41.920
If it's a 5 percent chance to survive, that's
not how you send a message; that's how you

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.670
try to kill someone.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:50.630
I have no doubt that this was a response to
my political activities in Russian opposition,

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:56.650
I think most specifically in response to my
work on the Magnitsky Act and the support

00:54:56.650 --> 00:55:01.030
and the participation in this process of the
imposition of individual targeted Western

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:03.800
sanctions against human rights abusers in
the Putin regime.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:09.920
I've been involved in this process together
with Boris Nemtsov and now without him for

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.830
many years now, and I will continue to do
this, by the way, because I think this is

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:14.830
very important.

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:22.300
This is, as we discussed before, this was
one of only two things that really worry Vladimir

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:23.300
Putin's regime.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:28.010
MICHAEL KIRK - … How is it viewed in Russia
now?

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:33.680
What did he win out of his being involved
in the U.S. elections?

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.820
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - … The goal of the
meetings the Kremlin proxies tried to set

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:43.300
up with Trump campaign officials was to undermine
and overturn the Magnitsky Act.

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.190
This is an overriding priority for them.

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:48.443
It's also mind-boggling in a way.

00:55:48.443 --> 00:55:55.400
If you think about that the unofficial foreign
policy priority of the Russian state and an

00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:04.800
official task of diplomats in the foreign
service, is to overturn personal sanctions

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.030
against crooks and human rights abusers.

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:12.490
This is actually insulting for Russian diplomats
and for Russian foreign service, that they've

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:16.040
been put in the service of the crooks and
human rights abusers trying to gain their

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.590
personal privileges back.

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.010
But this is what Putin has been doing.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:27.300
I think if we ask what the goal was of his
presumed interference in the U.S. electoral

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:34.660
process, it’s to try to get the Magnitsky
Law overturned, repealed or at least not implemented

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.140
properly.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.130
Including for those people who are concerned
about all of this from the U.S. political

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:50.870
standpoint, I think it's crucial to watch
how the Magnitsky Act continues to be implemented.

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:55.480
The current secretary of state, Rex Tillerson,
during his Senate confirmation hearings in

00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:02.790
January of 2017 was asked publicly, on the
record, whether the administration will continue

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:08.020
to enforce the Magnitsky Act and put out new
names in a sanctions list.

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:12.480
He publicly said yes, the administration will
continue to enforce Magnitsky Act and add

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.380
new names.

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:19.920
Let us see how this act is enforced and how
the new names are added.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.770
So far, there's not been a single new name
added under the Magnitsky Act.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:29.590
This, by the way, is nothing new, either,
because the Obama administration has been

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:31.970
very timid in implementing this law.

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:34.630
They were against it in the first place; they
didn't want it to happen.

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:39.030
When it did happen, when it was passed with
huge, overwhelming bipartisan majorities in

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:44.730
both Houses of Congress—not something that
happens very often in this town, as I understand—once

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:48.340
this became law they had to implement it,
but they were really timid about it.

00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:54.620
For the first four years, they were putting
just some really low-level people … until

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.010
their last two weeks in office.

00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:01.750
In its last two weeks, the Obama administration
added the most high-profile person so far

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:06.080
to this list, the top law enforcement official
in Putin's regime, Gen. Alexander Bastrykin,

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.470
head of the investigative committee of the
Russian Federation, Putin's old university

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:15.230
friend, the man who is responsible for all
the politically motivated prosecutions in

00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:20.030
recent years in Russia against opposition
activists and leaders; the man who once personally

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:27.180
took an independent journalist to a forest
outside of Moscow—this is a top-line enforcement

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:32.710
official in [the] Putin regime, a general,
personally drove a journalist to a forest

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:38.290
and threatened to kill him if his newspaper
continued with the investigations.

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:42.730
And [he] attempted a joke saying, “Ha, ha,
by the way, I'll be the one in charge of the

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:44.820
investigation of your murder, so don’t worry
about this.”

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:46.040
And this is not disputed, by the way.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.540
This is not alleged or supposed; he admitted
this.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:53.460
He also said he was sorry afterward, but I
don't think that's, frankly, enough.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:58.140
This guy was put on the Magnitsky list in
January of 2017.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:02.240
But for years before that, the Obama administration
had been very timid about implementing it.

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:06.120
This administration so far has not added a
single new name to the Magnitsky list.

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.990
Let’s see how it continues to be implemented.

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:15.780
I think this is going to be the key criterion
to judge all of these things on.

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:20.310
Your question of what did Putin get out of
trying to do what he did?

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:27.930
Well, if the Magnitsky Act stops working,
then Putin will have got what he wanted.

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:30.800
JIM GILMORE - And Putin's view of Trump?

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:40.700
How do you think he views Trump through the
campaign and now that he’s president?

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.790
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - I think for Putin,
it’s not about people and personalities.

00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:49.900
It’s about how he can use circumstances
and situations to his own benefit and for

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.840
his own ends.

00:59:51.840 --> 01:00:01.140
I don't think it’s anything personal for
him.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:08.210
His goal was to create, I think, circumstances
and the situation politically in the U.S.

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:13.680
where he would be able to advance his own
goals and his regime’s goals.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.500
Chief among that is to undermine and get rid
of the Magnitsky Act.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:22.080
I don't think it’s necessarily a personal
thing, that he wanted to help a particular

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.430
person or he wanted to prevent a particular
person.

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:27.770
He's very cynical about this.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:32.130
As they say in movies about mafia, nothing
personal, strictly business.

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:33.140
I think that's his attitude.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.700
DAVID HOFFMAN - … Isn't it possible he was
motivated by a belief that America’s democracy

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:42.850
is manipulated just like he manipulates Russian
democracy; that everybody does it; that all

01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:47.940
television is ordered from the top; that all
journalism is and so on?

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:55.290
I mean, isn't it possible he wanted to create
kind of a parallel universe and just create

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:56.290
chaos in America?

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:59.480
VLADIMIR V. KARA-MURZA - … If you look and
analyze what Putin's propaganda has been doing,

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:05.270
I think they’ve long stopped pretending
that this regime is so good and great and

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.730
beneficial for the Russian people.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:12.780
Their message is that, first of all, all the
others are even worse; and secondly, that

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.580
everybody does it across the world, too, and
that there's no such thing as real democracy.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.140
There's no such thing as genuine media freedom.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:25.110
There's no such thing as real elections, and
everywhere is manipulated.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:33.690
If it were possible to create doubts and to
create chaos with the political system of

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:40.360
a major Western democratic country like the
U.S., I think that will certainly serve the

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.030
propaganda goals of Vladimir Putin's regime.

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:46.650
This may indeed be another aspect of this.

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:53.430
If you look at the coverage in Kremlin-controlled
media of elections, not just the U.S. election

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:59.750
of 2016 but also other elections—the recent
French election, the upcoming elections in

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:04.240
Germany—that has been the message; that
yeah, everywhere is like this.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.520
Everywhere there's administrative resource;
everywhere there's no real media freedom;

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:14.810
and everywhere the elections are manipulated
and controlled and achieve the result of the

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:19.140
current whoever’s in government wants.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.020
I'm stating the completely obvious here, but
needless to say, that flies in the face of

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:26.920
the facts just beginning with the simple fact
that so many people who have been in power

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.370
have actually lost elections in Western countries.

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:34.040
This has never yet happened in Russia.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.160
Just think about this.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:42.390
Throughout the whole of the history of Russia,
there has never been a ruler who has lost

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:48.250
an election, at least lost an election to
an extent that he then lost power.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:52.470
Boris Yeltsin, when he was president, he lost
a lot of parliamentary elections, so he had

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:57.070
actually an opposition majority in parliament
for the duration of his presidency.

01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.620
The parliament was a real thing in Yeltsin's
Russia, unlike today.

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.520
But he still stayed in power.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:10.470
There was not a single election in Russian
history when the ruler, the incumbent, lost

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.120
power as the result of an election.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120
Just think about this.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.320
MICHAEL KIRK - Good.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.580
Thank you very much.
