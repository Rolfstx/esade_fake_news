 Funded by our viewers, patreon.com/statedclearly clearly stated 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.540
 Clearly stated: Where do the new viruses come from? 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
 If you're watching the news, you may have heard about the new Corona Virus novel 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.080
 That started in late 2019 with people getting sick in China 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.140
 Global flights allowed him to spread from person to person to new countries 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.530
 Where governments began to impose flight attendance and even quarantine 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 Claims of the virus' origin have begun to circulate online 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.460
 Some have claimed that it may be a genetically modified weapon 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.200
 But the overwhelming claims require massive evidence. At present, this claim appears to be out of the question 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.520
 Others have claimed that the virus may be an infiltrated sample from a laboratory 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.440
 Reality may be possible, viruses that have been leaked from laboratories in the past 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.560
 But while I record this passage, the investigations into this allegation have not reached certain results 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.760
 Could there be another, more natural explanation for the origin of the viruses? 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.260
 The answer is yes 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.580
 COVID-19 is the new human virus that infects humans, simply it may have evolved from a larger corona virus that infects animals 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 To find out how this happens, let's first look at viruses in general 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.060
 What are viruses? 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.500
 Among all the things that can make you sick is by infection and reproduction inside you 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.820
 Viruses are among the smallest. 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.440
 If we change the size to a more realistic scale 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.360
 You will see that hundreds of viruses can be deposited inside a single bacterial cell 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.620
 This degree is accurate. Thousands of different famous species have been studied and interpreted by scholars to date 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.120
 Possibly millions more 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.860
 They are found in many forms, but all types consist of a small set of genes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.320
 Strings of DNA or RNA that carry information to make more copies of the virus 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.480
 These genes are contained within a protein protective shell and sometimes a sebaceous membrane 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.140
 All known viruses are parasitic 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.760
 But most of them do not intrude on humans, instead some target plant cells 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.680
 Others target bacteria and so on 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.100
 The virus multiplies by inserting its genes into a living cell 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.340
 Different viruses do this in different ways, but once they enter the cell behaves as if the viral genes were their own 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.180
 It begins by reading it and building copies of the virus instead of performing its regular tasks 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.900
 Corona viruses are a huge family of viruses that infect animal cells 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.760
 Some of them infect chickens, others infect pigs, others infect humans 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.040
 But most of them are very weak. Simply catch a cold 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.560
 "Corona" means the crown and clearly indicates the large crown that resembles nails clinging to its membrane 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.320
 These protein nails selectively stick to a velcro-like shape 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.320
 It does not stick to most of the objects, but it adheres strongly when it collides with special particles 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.780
 They are found outside the animal cells. When it establishes itself firmly 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.660
 The Corona virus is waiting for it to be swallowed by the cell 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.680
 Then it begins to multiply at the expense of the cell 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.280
 Different animals have different molecules outside their cells 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280
 For this reason, viruses that infect birds cannot infect humans 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.740
 Because its adhesive does not stick tightly to our cells 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.820
 Unfortunately, the process of normal development sometimes helps the virus overcome this problem 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.420
 When the virus begins to replicate during reproduction, mutations can occur 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.160
 It occurs either as a result of a slight error in the reproduction process, or as a result of the rearrangements and recombination 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.700
 These occur when one or more viruses infect one cell 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.360
 In most cases, mutations that change the shape of viral nails lead to the virus being useless 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.489
 Its adhesive stops sticking to any host cell. Nevertheless, in rare cases 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.020
 A mutation occurs that enables the virus to stick to new types of hosts 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.460
 If the modified virus is fortunate enough to collide with this new host type, the infection will occur 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.780
 We call it "indirect infection." 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.700
 The virus has turned into a new type of host 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.700
 At the beginning of the transformation process, the virus is usually not very good at infecting its new host 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.900
 Its adhesive is not completely identical as well as many hindrances that may slow down the virus 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.360
 The mutations that enabled him to infect the new host often made him worse 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.980
 In his original host injury. As a result, many mutant viruses become extinct 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.540
 After only one or two people are injured 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.180
 They are usually deadly ends. 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.940
 But if the virus survives and reproduces long enough, then natural selection will be promoted by new mutations 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.580
 It helps it spread and breed better in the new host species 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.340
 Useful mutations accumulate across multiple strains, unhelpful mutations decay 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.860
 Suddenly! A new epidemic is making noise in the news 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.000
 Despite our belief that these viruses suddenly found 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.020
 Scientists know that there is a small flame before the explosion 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.660
 Genetic evidence tells us that slow evolutionary changes were the reason 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.920
 Almost every major outbreak has been known throughout history 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.940
 At the beginning of 2000, Corona virus used to infect bats 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.800
 It seems to have evolved to catch civet cats. And he has suffered increasing mutations, transforming to infect humans 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.620
 We call it "SARS" virus because it causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.820
 It has spread globally from person to person and some scientists have contracted it in the laboratory 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.819
 Over time, the virus was contained, and more than 8,000 people were infected 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.960
 More than 700 people have died. Corona virus also transformed from beauty to infect humans 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.680
 Causing more deaths. Corona viruses are not the only type of virus that infects animals 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.080
 Which can cope with new hosts. 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.360
 HIV is transformed from chimpanzees, usually when someone injures themselves when preparing meat for dinner 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.330
 Swine flu was partly caused by swine, but we think it has evolved 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.240
 By reconstituting a pig virus with a bird virus 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.820
 The Spanish flu in 1918, which destroyed the world's population 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.340
 And that may be turned from chicken! But the evidence is not yet conclusive 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.680
 Another new Corona virus may be another example of normal development 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:11.080
 A similar virus is found in bats and another newly discovered in the pangolin 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.880
 These animals are threatened with extinction, and they are protected 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.740
 But it is often used as a food, ritual, or as an alternative treatment 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.680
 In areas where COVID- 19 first spread 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.360
 Now there are researchers investigating 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.980
 Ensure that the virus did not infiltrate from a laboratory, either accidentally or intentionally 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.500
 After all, genetically modified virus technology already exists 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.860
 But it is important to understand that the process of descending adjustment 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.920
 Affected by natural selection are actually producing new viruses 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.840
 It occurs naturally. 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.080
 Possibility of the virus successfully developing and infecting a new species 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.400
 Very few, but there are more than seven and a half billion people on this planet 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.200
 Most of us deal with animals on a daily basis 

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.560
 We keep them as pets and eat them as food 

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:10.320
 This means that there are billions of opportunities for injury to occur every day 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.940
 Add to that the fact that the entire world is now interconnected through 

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.780
 Global flights, and your awareness of what is happening in Vegas 

00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:23.229
 He doesn't really stay in Vegas, at least not the way it was before 

00:08:23.229 --> 00:08:27.050
 Fortunately we have international organizations like the World Health Organization 

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.830
 And various centers to control diseases and help to contain the spread after it occurs 

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.240
 With global cooperation, we were able to prevent many disasters in the past 

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.800
 In the future, we will prevent many as long as our species works together 

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.120
 So the bottom line, where do the new viruses come from? 

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.920
 Most of the time, new viruses develop from larger viruses 

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.540
 Stopping the spread of new viruses requires global cooperation. 

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:06.180
