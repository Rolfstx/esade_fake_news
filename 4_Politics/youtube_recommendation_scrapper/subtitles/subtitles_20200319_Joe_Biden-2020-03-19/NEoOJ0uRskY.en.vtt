00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.235
The NATO summit.

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:06.105
It's the annual meeting of the
world's most powerful alliance.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:09.108
Sort of like if the Avengers
were extremely concerned

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.643
about steel tariffs.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:13.446
And yesterday, the meeting
got off to a rocky start.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.281
President Trump had
a testy exchange

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.849
with the president of France.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:20.286
He called out Canada for not
pulling its weight financially.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:21.654
And he demanded

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:25.024
that Germany stop pronouncing
their "W"s like "V"s.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.628
"You're make 'Wienerschnitzel'
sound way less funny like that.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.697
It's 'wiener,' not 'viener.'"

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.901
So Trump spent all day causing
chaos at the NATO summit. Right?

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.570
And then, later that day,
it lead to something

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:40.206
that nobody has seen before--

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.242
a bunch of world leaders
caught on camera

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.112
laughing at America's president

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.014
behind his back.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.248
Breaking overnight.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.417
A video that might just
drive the president crazy.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.287
It appears to show the Canadian
prime minister, Justin Trudeau,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.055
the French president,
Emmanuel Macron,

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:57.924
and British prime minister
Boris Johnson

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:01.127
laughing at how the president
conducted himself yesterday.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.395
Watch this.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.589
Man.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.225
-(laughter)
-That... that video...

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.260
That video is amazing
for two reasons.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.195
One-- it is crazy
that we were able

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:38.397
to hear a private conversation
between major world leaders.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.266
Like, did they not know
this was happening?

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.703
And two-- that
when world leaders get together,

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.105
they are gossipy bitches
just like the rest of us.

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:48.341
-(laughter)
-Like...

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.343
(applause and cheering)

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.011
'Cause, like...

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:53.880
I thought... I thought

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.781
after meetings with Trump,
world leaders would be like,

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:57.316
(British accent):
"Okay, we need to go back

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.684
and draw up a new treaty."

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:01.787
Instead, they're out there like,
"What was he wearing?"

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.090
And the French guy is like,
"Oh, so he can't speak English.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.291
"I mean, I don't speak English,

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:07.793
but he really can't
speak English!"

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.662
Yeah, it turns out
NATO is so catty,

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:11.297
they should get Andy Cohen
to host it.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.132
That's what they should do.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.101
And while most people thought
this video

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.904
of world leaders trashing Trump
was hilarious,

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:21.641
there was, uh, one person
who did not find it funny.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.510
We got the president leaving
a testy NATO summit.

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:26.679
Leaders appear to be mocking him
behind the scenes,

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.214
and that was the last straw.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:30.349
The president responding
right in front of the cameras.

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:31.684
Take a look.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.759
(camera shutters clicking)

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.096
The president was scheduled
to have a press conference

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.699
before he left, but during
that bilateral meeting,

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:50.002
after he was asked about
this video that's going viral

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:52.738
of Trudeau that we played for
you, the president said: Well,

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.374
I don't think I'm going to have
the press conference now.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.143
I think after
my bilateral meetings,

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.612
I'll just get on the plane
and head back home.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.981
Yeah. In response
to what happened,

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:04.850
Trump called Trudeau "two-faced"

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:07.920
and announced that he
was leaving the summit early.

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:09.855
And you know what,
you know what,

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:12.825
to be fair, Trump's not wrong--
Justin Trudeau is two-faced.

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:15.161
He's got a white one
and a brown one.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.829
-(laughter, groaning)
-And...

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:20.733
as for him going home,
as for Trump going home early,

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.101
guys...

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.370
I think they hurt his feelings.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:26.038
(laughter)

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:29.108
Yeah. It's like... it's
like Trump was at a sleepover,

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.344
and all the other kids
turned on him.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.946
You know? And now
he's just there like, "Mom,

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.482
I know it's a day early,

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.051
but can you come pick me up
from NATO?"

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.920
(laughter)

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.856
And look, man, I know a lot
of people don't like Trump,

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.958
but I don't care
who you are, man,

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:48.194
every single one of us
knows this feeling.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:51.631
Huh? Finding out
all the cool kids at school

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.833
are laughing at you?

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.968
Hmm? And then you run home
all the way, crying.

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.070
And you know
when you're a kid and you cry,

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:00.139
you run with your arms dangling
by your sides.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:02.208
(sobbing loudly)

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:08.581
(continues sobbing)

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.320
And for Trump,
the most hurtful thing

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:16.889
is probably the fact
that Boris Johnson joined in.

00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:19.558
That's a shitty thing.
That's shitty, Boris.

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:22.161
-(cheering, applause)
-That's a shitty move, Boris.

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:24.430
That's your friend!

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.699
You know who Boris is?
Boris is that one kid

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:29.502
you think is your real friend,
and then you see him over there

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.103
trying to fit in
with everyone else,

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:32.872
telling them
your deepest secrets.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.207
"Oh, and also, Donald told me
he pees the bed."

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.278
(like Trump): I told you that
in confidence, Boris!

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:41.881
So shitty.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.383
So President... President Trump
was clearly hurt

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:47.186
by what happened, and he decided
to head home early.

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.188
But before he left,
before he left,

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:51.891
he tried to get back
at all these other dudes

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.726
by making some new friends.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.194
NEWSMAN:
From the Merkel meeting,

00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:57.229
President Trump has got lunch
with a select group

00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:59.298
of NATO nations--
what President Trump calls

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:00.733
the "two percenters."

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:02.802
That's a group
of eight other nations

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:05.237
that are spending two percent
of their GDP on defense.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.573
They include Bulgaria, Greece,

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:10.543
Britain, Estonia, Romania,
Lithuania, Latvia

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:12.912
and Poland.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.980
Okay, this is
just embarrassing now.

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:17.883
Trump's rolling with Romania,
Lithuania and Latvia

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:19.585
because of what happened?

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:21.687
It's almost like
the popular kids dropped him,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.156
and now he's eating lunch
at the loser table.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.558
And they're
probably really nice.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.093
They're like,
"Don't be sad, Donald.

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:29.495
"You can have some
of my horse tongue.

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:31.897
It's boiled and pickled."

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.667
(like Trump):
Get away.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.571
So look, man, clearly NATO did
not go well for Donald Trump.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:41.207
And I'll be honest,
I don't blame The Donald

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.808
for flying home early.

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:45.144
Mr. President,
you shouldn't be in a place

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.847
where people are gonna laugh
at you behind your back.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.716
You get on Air Force One,
and you fly straight back home,

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:54.153
where we promise that we
will laugh at you to your face.

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:56.189
(laughter, cheering, applause)
