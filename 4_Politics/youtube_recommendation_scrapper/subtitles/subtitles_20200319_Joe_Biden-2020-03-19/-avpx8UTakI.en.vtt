00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:13.492
 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.660
upsell world.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.660
 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.661
&gt;&gt; Tom: But we're not just

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:15.661
 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.396
talking their word for it.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.396
 

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:18.531
We've assembled a team of

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:18.531
 

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:22.568
testers to help us see for

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:22.568
 

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:26.038
ourselves.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:26.038
 

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:27.106
All of them work for CBC.

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:27.106
 

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:28.674
Anu, Steve, and Ryan.

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:28.674
 

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:30.276
Each driving a car with one

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:30.276
 

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:31.510
thing in common: They all need

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:31.510
 

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.278
an oil change, and nothing

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.278
 

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.946
else.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.946
 

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:35.248
They will be heading to that

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:35.248
 

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:38.584
same Economy Lube in Guelph.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:38.584
 

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:39.619
And what's about to happen has

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:39.619
 

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:41.153
lessons for us all.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.153
 

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:42.088
Our home base for the day is

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.088
 

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:43.522
Conestoga college.

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:43.522
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.490
They train a lot of future

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:44.490
 

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:47.393
mechanics here, and they have

00:03:43.522 --> 00:03:47.393
 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:48.361
agreed to let us use their

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.361
 

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:49.562
massive garage.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.562
 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.596
&gt;&gt; Tom: Morning everybody.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.596
 

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:52.331
Nice to see you.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.331
 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.733
So the plan as you know is

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.733
 

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:55.368
we're going to head down to

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.368
 

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:56.369
Economy Lube and you're going

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.369
 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.336
to just be customers.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:57.336
 

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.638
&gt;&gt; Tom: Helping us with our

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.638
 

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:59.972
test is expert Mark

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:59.972
 

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:01.474
Sach-Anderson.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:01.474
 

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:02.842
&gt;&gt; They shouldn't be offering

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:02.842
 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.776
you anymore than just the oil

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:03.776
 

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:05.144
change you're going in for.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.144
 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.414
Everything else is fine on the

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:08.414
 

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:09.982
car so it should be a nice

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:09.982
 

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:12.818
simple, easy, in, oil change,

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:12.818
 

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:13.586
and out.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.586
 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.520
(♪♪)

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:14.520
 

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:16.389
&gt;&gt; Tom: Mark has been in the

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.389
 

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:17.156
industry for more than 20

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.156
 

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:19.759
years.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.759
 

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:20.760
He began as an oil change

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.760
 

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:22.928
technician himself.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.928
 

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:23.863
Became a mechanic and worked

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.863
 

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:25.531
his way up the ranks.

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:25.531
 

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:27.433
He now runs this garage in

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.433
 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.802
Toronto's west end.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.802
 

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:30.936
&gt;&gt; There are a lot of good oil

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:30.936
 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.005
change facilities.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:33.005
 

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:34.340
Unfortunately, there's a few

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:34.340
 

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:35.908
bad ones, and it spoils it for

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.908
 

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:37.943
everybody.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.943
 

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:39.078
&gt;&gt; Tom: The oil change industry

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:39.078
 

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:41.280
knows it has a bad reputation.

00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:41.280
 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.248
&gt;&gt; It seems like mechanics are

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:42.248
 

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:43.249
always out to get you.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.249
 

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:44.583
&gt;&gt; Tom: Jiffy Lube, for

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:44.583
 

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.451
instance, plays off customer

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.451
 

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:46.952
worries in this ad.

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.952
 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.654
&gt;&gt; But at Jiffy Lube, we don't

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.654
 

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:51.123
fix vehicles, we help keep them

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:51.123
 

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:51.991
running right to help you leave

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:51.991
 

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:53.292
repair shop worries behind.

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.292
 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.827
&gt;&gt; Tom: So if the industry

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.827
 

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:57.463
knows we're suspicious, can we

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:57.463
 

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:59.465
really finally leave worries

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:59.465
 

00:04:54.894 --> 00:05:08.908
behind?

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:08.908
 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:09.675
If only.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:09.675
 

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:10.876
(♪♪)

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.876
 

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.078
&gt;&gt; Tom: To do our test properly,

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:12.078
 

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:13.479
it's important to establish a

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:13.479
 

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:15.781
base line.

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:15.781
 

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:16.682
So Mark spends days going over

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.682
 

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:17.950
test vehicles.

00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:17.950
 

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:19.218
He knows the kind of

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:19.218
 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.920
additional services routinely

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.920
 

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:22.555
offered by places like Economy

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:22.555
 

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:24.357
Lube, such as fluid and filter

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.357
 

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:25.424
changes, and he wants to beat

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:25.424
 

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.625
them to the punch.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:26.625
 

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:27.960
He makes sure none of our cars

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:27.960
 

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:33.165
need anything more than an oil

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:33.165
 

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:33.933
change.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.933
 

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:35.000
(♪♪)

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.000
 

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:36.402
&gt;&gt; Tom: Our hidden camera

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.402
 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.270
specialist. Rob, is hard at

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.270
 

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:40.206
work making sure we've got all

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:40.206
 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.073
the angles covered when it

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.073
 

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:42.141
comes to capturing our test.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.141
 

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:43.042
&gt;&gt; Tom: Cool.

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:43.042
 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.943
And where is that going to go?

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.943
 

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.177
&gt;&gt; Under the hood of the

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:45.177
 

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:46.679
Uplander.

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:46.679
 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.947
&gt;&gt; So the guy working under

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.947
 

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:48.647
the hood, we'll be able to

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.647
 

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:50.015
see his hands working.

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:50.015
 

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.050
&gt;&gt; We'll be able to see his

00:05:48.647 --> 00:05:51.050
 

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:51.851
hands reaching to all the

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:51.851
 

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:53.152
different -- stick and engine

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.152
 

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:54.120
coolant.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.120
 

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:57.823
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:57.823
 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:59.725
&gt;&gt; Tom: So wondering what to

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.725
 

00:05:54.187 --> 00:06:01.260
expect?

00:05:57.823 --> 00:06:01.260
 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.895
Back at Conestoga college, our

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:02.895
 

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:03.963
first tester, Anu, is wired up

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.963
 

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:06.899
and ready to go to see if what

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:06.899
 

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:08.000
we're hearing about Economy

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:08.000
 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.535
Lube holds true.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.535
 

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:10.936
&gt;&gt; I'll open the door for you.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.936
 

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:12.037
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:12.037
 

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:16.509
&gt;&gt; All right, good luck.

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:16.509
 

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:17.476
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Tom.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:17.476
 

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:18.511
(♪♪)

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.511
 

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:21.881
&gt;&gt; Tom: The Economy Lube shop

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:21.881
 

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:23.182
is less than five minutes down

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:23.182
 

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:24.550
the road from our home base.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.550
 

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:26.051
As Anu approaches, our

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:26.051
 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.854
surveillance camera across the

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.854
 

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:31.090
street picks her up and

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:31.090
 

00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:32.358
follows her in.

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:32.358
 

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:34.059
Our insiders say at Economy

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.059
 

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:35.261
Lube, the technicians count on

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:35.261
 

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:37.563
your ignorance, even though

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:37.563
 

00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:38.664
they might not know much more

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:38.664
 

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:40.299
about your car than you do.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.299
 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.368
&gt;&gt; When I started, I'd never

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:42.368
 

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:44.403
worked on vehicles, never

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:44.403
 

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:45.304
popped a drain plug, never did

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:45.304
 

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:46.272
an oil change, no experience.

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:46.272
 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.640
&gt;&gt; Tom: How about you?

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.640
 

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:48.507
&gt;&gt; I had experience from a

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.507
 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:49.408
previous oil change places but

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.408
 

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.843
I worked with people who

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:50.843
 

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:51.710
didn't know anything about

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.710
 

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:52.678
cars at all.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.678
 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.813
&gt;&gt; Tom: They soon learn the

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.813
 

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:55.080
way things work at Economy

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:55.080
 

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:56.315
Lube.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:56.315
 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.884
Who trained you?

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.884
 

00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:59.585
&gt;&gt; Actually, the owner of the

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.585
 

00:06:56.382 --> 00:07:00.319

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:00.319
 

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.153
&gt;&gt; Tom: And what did he teach

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.153
 

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:02.588
you?

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.588
 

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:03.322
&gt;&gt; How to sell all the

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:03.322
 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.657
different services, upselling.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.657
 

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:06.659
&gt;&gt; Tom: What did that mean at

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.659
 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.461
Economy Lube?

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:08.461
 

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:10.396
&gt;&gt; To sell as many services

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.396
 

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:11.564
and get as big of a bill as

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:11.564
 

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:12.465
you possibly could on every

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.465
 

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:13.332
single vehicle.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.332
 

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.300
&gt;&gt; Because he didn't care if

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:14.300
 

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.134
you did the work, he cared if

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.134
 

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.235
you got the money.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.235
 

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:18.404
&gt;&gt; Tom: And were these services

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:18.404
 

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:20.940
that were needed?

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:20.940
 

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:21.974
&gt;&gt; Uh, majority of the time, no.

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:21.974
 

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:23.342

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:24.577
 

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.678
of owner Steve Moxey right on

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.678
 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.879
the door as you enter Economy

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.879
 

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:28.113
Lube.

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:28.113
 

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:29.515
Moxey has built a chain of 12

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.515
 

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.683

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:31.884
 

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:33.519
And according to our insiders,

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:33.519
 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.920
he's done it through

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.920
 

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:35.588
dishonesty.

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.588
 

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.455
&gt;&gt; Just need an oil change?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.455
 

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:37.423
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.423
 

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.357
&gt;&gt; Tom: Inside the shop, our

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.357
 

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:45.331
first tester is hearing she

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:45.331
 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:46.198
needs a lot more than a simple

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:46.198
 

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:47.433
oil change.

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.433
 

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:48.734
&gt;&gt; Couldn't have smelled burnt

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:48.734
 

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:50.669
and it certainly wasn't brown

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:50.669
 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.670
because I changed it.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:51.670
 

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:53.172
&gt;&gt; Tom: And later, a former

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:54.106

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:57.443
&gt;&gt; I have told people all my

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.443
 

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:59.111
life that fraud is theft with

00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:59.111
 

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:59.111
a smile.

Lube.

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:14.527
 

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:15.761
Like all these types of shops,

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.761
 

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:17.029
they say they specialize in

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:17.029
 

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:22.268
fast work at affordable

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:26.572
&gt;&gt; Tom: Insiders tell us they

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:26.572
 

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:27.840
do a lot more than that.

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.840
 

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:29.241
Like sell you services you

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:29.241
 

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.042
don't need.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.042
 

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:31.644
&gt;&gt; Engine flush.

00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:31.644
 

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:33.445
&gt;&gt; Tom: Charge whatever they

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:33.445
 

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:34.280
can get and often not even do

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.280
 

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:35.514
the work.

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:35.514
 

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:36.649
&gt;&gt; Gimme some examples of

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.649
 

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:38.217
where you might do something

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:38.217
 

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:39.184
that wasn't really the real

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:39.184
 

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:40.352
thing?

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.352
 

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:41.120
&gt;&gt; One of the easiest things

00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:41.120
 

00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:42.755
to sell is power steering

00:08:40.352 --> 00:08:42.755
 

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.956
fluid.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.956
 

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:45.558
Take a sample and you can tell

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:45.558
 

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:47.026
a person that it should be

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:47.026
 

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:48.127
clear, you could tell a person

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:48.127
 

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:49.028
that it should be red, or you

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.028
 

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:50.296
could just go by the smell of

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:50.296
 

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:52.431
the fluid, smell this, the

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.431
 

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:53.699
fluid is very burnt.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.699
 

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:55.901
There's a very easy sale.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:55.901
 

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:57.136
&gt;&gt; Tom: With each lie they

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.136
 

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:58.637
tell, technicians earn money.

00:08:55.901 --> 00:08:58.637
 

00:08:55.968 --> 00:09:01.473
&gt;&gt; They were on a commission

00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:01.473
 

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:04.310
system as far as what you

00:08:58.637 --> 00:09:04.310
 

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:06.078
sold, so if I sold, say, a

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:06.078
 

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:08.714
coolant flush for $59, I would

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.714
 

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:09.715
get $2, if I sold it for 69

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:09.715
 

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:10.816
bucks, I get three bucks.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.816
 

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:12.017
&gt;&gt; Tom: The bigger the lie,

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.017
 

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:13.586
the more money.

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:13.586
 

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:14.553
That's why they do so much

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:14.553
 

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:15.888
lying.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.888
 

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.922
How often would those things

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:16.922
 

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.790
happen where you do a trick

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.790
 

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:18.857
every day.

00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:18.857
 

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:21.493
&gt;&gt; Every day.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.493
 

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:22.394
&gt;&gt; Multiple times a day.

00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:22.394
 

00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:23.662

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:23.662
 

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.663
&gt;&gt; Tom: So will it happen to

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:24.663
 

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:26.599
our first tester?

00:09:23.662 --> 00:09:26.599
 

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:28.567
Anu's car has been up on the

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:28.567
 

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.568
hoist for a few short minutes.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.568
 

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:30.469
When she gets the prognosis.

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:30.469
 

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:31.103
&gt;&gt; Most of your stuff is in

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:31.103
 

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:32.004
good shape.

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.004
 

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:33.138
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:33.138
 

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.406
&gt;&gt; Tom: The car needs more

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.406
 

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:36.342
than an oil change, he says,

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:36.342
 

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:37.743
it needs a brake flush and

00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:37.743
 

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:39.078
power steering flush, two

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:39.078
 

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.212
procedures that involve time

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:40.212
 

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:45.985
and the complete replacement

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:45.985
 

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:47.286
of fluids.

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:47.286
 

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:48.220
But why?

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.220
 

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:52.891
&gt;&gt; Tom: Burning fluid.

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:52.891
 

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:53.726
Just like our insiders talked

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.726
 

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:54.760
about.

00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:54.760
 

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.495
&gt;&gt; Tom: Remember, our expert

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:56.495
 

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:58.030
mechanic has checked out this

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.030
 

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:59.031
car and assures us it needs no

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:59.031
 

00:09:56.562 --> 00:10:16.181
such work.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:16.181
 

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:17.516
But in keeping with our test,

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:17.516
 

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:19.051
we give the go-ahead.

00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:19.051
 

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:20.152
&gt;&gt; Tom: In reality it takes

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:20.152
 

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:34.400
them half that time.

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:34.400
 

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:35.401
In less than eight minutes, we

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:35.401
 

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:50.149
get the bill.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:50.149
 

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:50.983
&gt;&gt; Tom: More than 200 bucks?

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:50.983
 

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:51.750
How did that happen?

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.750
 

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:58.991
&gt;&gt; Tom: We push for a better

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:58.991
 

00:10:51.050 --> 00:11:01.260
explanation and get a better

00:10:51.750 --> 00:11:01.260
 

00:10:51.817 --> 00:11:02.895
deal in the process.

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:02.895
 

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:06.932
&gt;&gt; Tom: Our tester pays up.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.932
 

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:08.133
And heads back to home base.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:08.133
 

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:09.001
(♪♪)

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:09.001
 

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:10.369
&gt;&gt; Tom: So how did it go?

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:10.369
 

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.203
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.203
 

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:12.337
They were really nice.

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.337
 

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:13.639
&gt;&gt; Tom: Can we see the bill?

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:13.639
 

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.907
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:11:12.337 --> 00:11:14.907
 

00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:16.341
&gt;&gt; Tom: Nice is nice but our

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.341
 

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:18.377
expert mechanic Mark Sach-

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:18.377
 

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:20.045
Anderson says there's nothing

00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:20.045
 

00:11:16.408 --> 00:11:21.647
nice about that final bill.

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:21.647
 

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:23.282
In your view, the power

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:23.282
 

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:24.983
steering flush and brake fluid

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:24.983
 

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:26.285
flush were not needed?

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:26.285
 

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:27.252
&gt;&gt; No.

00:11:24.983 --> 00:11:27.252
 

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.654
The fluids were up.

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:28.654
 

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:32.458
All of this was checked when I

00:11:27.252 --> 00:11:32.458
 

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:33.492
had it at my shop.

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:33.492
 

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:35.294
Not three days ago.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.294
 

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:36.562
&gt;&gt; Tom: Not only was the work

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:36.562
 

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:40.666
not needed, Mark suspects it

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:40.666
 

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:41.633
wasn't done.

00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:41.633
 

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:43.268
Given how little time it took.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.268
 

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:44.570
Mark shows us the four points

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:44.570
 

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.638
behind the wheels where it

00:11:43.268 --> 00:11:46.638
 

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:47.806
would be clear if a brake

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.806
 

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:50.242
flush had been carried out.

00:11:46.638 --> 00:11:50.242
 

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:51.744
&gt;&gt; There's so much rust on the

00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:51.744
 

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:54.379
back of this bleeder or on the

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:54.379
 

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:55.347
bleeder here, and around the

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:55.347
 

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:56.482
seal, it hasn't been opened.

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:56.482
 

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:58.350
That tells me that the system's

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:58.350
 

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:59.351
not flushed.

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:59.351
 

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.350
&gt;&gt; Tom: All right, Mark,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.919
 

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:01.987
let's go to the videotape, shall

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.987
 

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:03.355
we, and see what they did.

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:03.355
 

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:05.023
Our videotape confirms Mark's

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:05.023
 

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:06.725
suspicions.

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:06.725
 

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:07.960
&gt;&gt; Tightening the filter,

00:12:05.023 --> 00:12:07.960
 

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.428
wiping off any oil.

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:09.428
 

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:10.195
&gt;&gt; Tom: That $90 brake flush

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.195
 

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:10.796
never happened.

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:10.796
 

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.730
&gt;&gt; Tom: Still nothing on the

00:12:10.195 --> 00:12:11.730
 

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:12.464
brakes.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.464
 

00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:13.632
&gt;&gt; Nothing on the brakes.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.632
 

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:14.867
&gt;&gt; Tom: Same for the power

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:14.867
 

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:17.136
steering flush.

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:17.136
 

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:18.103
Our hidden hood cam shows no

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:18.103
 

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:19.538
evidence it was performed.

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:19.538
 

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:20.773
&gt;&gt; But reality is you were

00:12:18.103 --> 00:12:20.773
 

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:24.543
charged for it.

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:24.543
 

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:25.244
And it wasn't done.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:25.244
 

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:26.078
(♪♪)

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:26.078
 

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.246
&gt;&gt; Tom: Time for test number

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.246
 

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:28.981
two.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:28.981
 

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:30.315
Our man Ryan is pulling up for

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:30.315
 

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:32.551
his oil change.

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:32.551
 

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:33.552
And who knows what else.

00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:33.552
 

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:34.820
&gt;&gt; I'm here for the engine oil

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.820
 

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:36.121
change.

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:36.121
 

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:37.356
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no problem.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.356
 

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:43.796
&gt;&gt; Tom: Just like last time,

00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:43.796
 

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:44.763
that $20 oil change they

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:44.763
 

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:46.131
advertise becomes 29.

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:46.131
 

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:47.299
&gt;&gt; Tom: And just like last

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:47.299
 

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.500
time, it doesn't end there.

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:48.500
 

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:53.405
After a quick inspection, they

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:53.405
 

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:55.407
tell Ryan he needs more than

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:55.407
 

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:56.675
his oil change.

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:56.675
 

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:57.876
&gt;&gt; Tom: The brakes, again,

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:57.876
 

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:59.211
and the transmission?

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.211
 

00:12:56.742 --> 00:13:00.679
Our expert, Mark, just did that

00:12:57.876 --> 00:13:00.679
 

00:12:57.943 --> 00:13:02.915
a few days ago.

00:12:59.211 --> 00:13:02.915
 

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:04.116
A messy and lengthy procedure

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:04.116
 

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:05.384
we captured on camera.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.384
 

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:06.819
Our insiders tell us this kind

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:06.819
 

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:07.719
of deception can really add

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:07.719
 

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:09.188
up.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:09.188
 

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:10.055
&gt;&gt; As much as you didn't want

00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:10.055
 

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:11.390
to do it but at the end of the

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:11.390
 

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:12.491
week when you get a thousand

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.491
 

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:13.992
dollar paycheque take home.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.992
 

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:16.061
&gt;&gt; The money was just too

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:16.061
 

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:16.929
good.

00:13:13.992 --> 00:13:16.929
 

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:18.363
With a high school education,

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:18.363
 

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:22.067
where are you going to make

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:22.067
 

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:22.901
between 65 and $100,000

00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:22.901
 

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:25.103
a year?

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:25.103
 

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:26.071
&gt;&gt; Tom: Now Ryan is handing over

00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:26.071
 

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:31.610
his money at Economy Lube.

00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:31.610
 

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:32.411
After just ten minutes of work

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:32.411
 

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:33.912
on his car.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.912
 

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:35.347
&gt;&gt; Tom: On his way with some

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:35.347
 

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:38.116
air fresheners and a bill that

00:13:33.912 --> 00:13:38.116
 

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:38.951
stinks.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:38.951
 

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:39.918
&gt;&gt; Thank you, bye.

00:13:38.116 --> 00:13:39.918
 

00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:41.253
&gt;&gt; Tom: Back at home base, we

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:41.253
 

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:44.156
have a look.

00:13:39.918 --> 00:13:44.156
 

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:44.756
How was it?

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:44.756
 

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.490
&gt;&gt; It was, yeah, pricey.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.490
 

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:47.025
&gt;&gt; Tom: We'll see what you

00:13:44.756 --> 00:13:47.025
 

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:48.293
came up with.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.293
 

00:13:45.557 --> 00:13:49.161
218.

00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:49.161
 

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:49.995
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:48.293 --> 00:13:49.995
 

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.097
&gt;&gt; Tom: You asked for a $20

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:52.097
 

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:54.032
oil change?

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:54.032
 

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:56.468
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I did.

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:56.468
 

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:57.736
&gt;&gt; Tom: $218, Ryan's bill is

00:13:54.032 --> 00:13:57.736
 

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:59.271
ten times when he went in for,

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:59.271
 

00:13:56.535 --> 00:14:00.405
including 80 bucks for the

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.405
 

00:13:57.803 --> 00:14:01.039
transmission.

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.039
 

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:02.841
Was that needed?

00:14:00.405 --> 00:14:02.841
 

00:14:00.472 --> 00:14:03.775
&gt;&gt; No.

00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:03.775
 

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:04.743
I just, just did a transmission

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.743
 

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:05.644
service on this.

00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:05.644
 

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:06.678
&gt;&gt; Tom: That's what I thought.

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:06.678
 

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:13.719
We check our hidden camera

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:13.719
 

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:14.519
tape to see how they sell that

00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:14.519
 

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:15.821
one.

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.821
 

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:18.223
&gt;&gt; Tom: There's that burning

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:18.223
 

00:14:14.586 --> 00:14:19.992
fluid line again.

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:19.992
 

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:22.427
Our expert is appalled.

00:14:18.223 --> 00:14:22.427
 

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:23.395
&gt;&gt; It did not smelled burned

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:23.395
 

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:26.064
because it was all fresh fluid.

00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:26.064
 

00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:27.132
But I mean there's absolutely

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:27.132
 

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:28.500
no way that this service was

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:28.500
 

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:30.168
needed.

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:30.168
 

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:32.037
Good sales pitch.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.037
 

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:34.973
But it's completely false.

00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:34.973
 

00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:36.008
It's almost like a script,

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:36.008
 

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:38.310
it's almost identical to the

00:14:34.973 --> 00:14:38.310
 

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.212
service that we had on car

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:40.212
 

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:41.346
number one, the same it's

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.346
 

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:43.282
dirty, it smells.

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:43.282
 

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:44.149
&gt;&gt; Tom: So how about that

00:14:41.346 --> 00:14:44.149
 

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:45.083
expensive brake flush?

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.083
 

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:47.386
They didn't actually do it the

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:47.386
 

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:50.088
first time they charged for

00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:50.088
 

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:50.889
it, how about this time?

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:50.889
 

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:51.623
Mark checks and says no.

00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:51.623
 

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.157
They didn't do a flush?

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:52.157
 

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.925
&gt;&gt; They couldn't have done a

00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:52.925
 

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.059
flush.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:54.059
 

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:55.394
&gt;&gt; Tom: Two for two.

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:55.394
 

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:59.164
Two flushes paid for that

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:59.164
 

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:59.865
didn't happen.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:59.865
 

00:14:55.461 --> 00:15:01.033
(♪♪)

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.033
 

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:02.267
&gt;&gt; Tom: Our third and final

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:02.267
 

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:03.669
tester Steve pulls in towards

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.669
 

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.503
the end of the day to get

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:04.503
 

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:05.704
his oil changed.

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.704
 

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:06.638
But will the upsell happen

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.638
 

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:19.518
again?

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:19.518
 

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:20.552
The answer comes minutes

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:20.552
 

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:21.520
later.

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.520
 

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:23.288
&gt;&gt; Tom: The technician promises

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:23.288
 

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:26.925
to flush out the entire engine

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.925
 

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:28.360
block and the radiator, and of

00:15:23.288 --> 00:15:28.360
 

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:29.528
course, the braking system.

00:15:26.925 --> 00:15:29.528
 

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:30.295
Back at home base...

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.295
 

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:31.363
&gt;&gt; Tom: How was it?

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.363
 

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.030
&gt;&gt; That was the most expensive

00:15:30.295 --> 00:15:32.030
 

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:32.664
$19.99 I ever spent.

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:32.664
 

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.932
&gt;&gt; Tom: Really?

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.932
 

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:36.001
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:15:32.664 --> 00:15:36.001
 

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:36.935
&gt;&gt; Tom: Let's see.

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:36.935
 

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:38.003
251 bucks?

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:38.003
 

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:39.271
Good Lord, that's the highest

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.271
 

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:40.172
of the day.

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:40.172
 

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.106
What was the sales pressure

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.106
 

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:42.607
like on you?

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:42.607
 

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:43.942
&gt;&gt; They start off sounding

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.942
 

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:45.010
like you can choose, but they

00:15:42.607 --> 00:15:45.010
 

00:15:42.674 --> 00:15:46.011
sort of -- they gradually move

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:46.011
 

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:47.446
it into you really should get

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.446
 

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:48.914
it, we can do it for you right

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:48.914
 

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:49.982
now.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.982
 

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:51.283
&gt;&gt; Tom: But did they do it?

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:51.283
 

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:53.385
Mark is interested in the full

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:53.385
 

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:54.353
system coolant flush they

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.353
 

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.487
charged for.

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:55.487
 

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:57.656
He says this car uses a

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:57.656
 

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.690
special coolant called

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:58.690
 

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:59.891
dex-cool which is orange.

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.891
 

00:15:57.723 --> 00:16:01.293
He shows us what's in the

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.293
 

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:03.061
resevoir.

00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:03.061
 

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:04.396
&gt;&gt; Look at that, bright green.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:04.396
 

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.030
&gt;&gt; Tom: Bright green.

00:16:03.061 --> 00:16:05.030
 

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:06.064
That's not the proper coolant?

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:06.064
 

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:07.032
&gt;&gt; That's not the proper

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.032
 

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:08.633
coolant for this vehicle.

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:08.633
 

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:12.070
&gt;&gt; Tom: Is what's in there in

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:12.070
 

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:12.871
here?

00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:12.871
 

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:14.339
&gt;&gt; We don't know that.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.339
 

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.540
&gt;&gt; Tom: Mark wants to take a

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.540
 

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:17.275
sample from the radiator.

00:16:14.339 --> 00:16:17.275
 

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:19.745
He says if an actual flush was

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.745
 

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:22.080
done, the fluid coming out

00:16:17.275 --> 00:16:22.080
 

00:16:17.342 --> 00:16:24.216
will also be green.

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:24.216
 

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:26.318
&gt;&gt; That looks orange to me.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.318
 

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:27.019
Oh, yeah.

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:27.019
 

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:28.987
Look at that.

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:28.987
 

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:30.088
Okay.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.088
 

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:30.822
So that's coming out of the

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:30.822
 

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:33.425
radiator.

00:16:30.088 --> 00:16:33.425
 

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:34.893
&gt;&gt; Tom: Right.

00:16:30.822 --> 00:16:34.893
 

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:36.661
&gt;&gt; That is what is throughout

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:36.661
 

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:39.998
the system.

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:39.998
 

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:42.067
What we've seen changed here

00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:42.067
 

00:16:36.728 --> 00:16:44.036
is the stuff in the resevoir

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:44.036
 

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:44.870
and it's been changed with the

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:44.870
 

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:46.171
wrong stuff.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.171
 

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:47.105
&gt;&gt; Tom: And what does that

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.105
 

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:49.274
mean for the vehicle?

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:49.274
 

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:51.176
&gt;&gt; It can cause damage to the

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:51.176
 

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:54.679
sensors, it can cause damage

00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:54.679
 

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:55.680
and premature wear inside the

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:55.680
 

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:56.882
engine.

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:56.882
 

00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:59.851
We should really be pulling

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.851
 

00:16:55.747 --> 00:17:00.752
that stuff out of the resevoir

00:16:56.882 --> 00:17:00.752
 

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:02.654
before it causes problems.

00:16:59.851 --> 00:17:02.654
 

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:04.356
&gt;&gt; Tom: So not only was the

00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:04.356
 

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:06.124
coolant publish not needed, it

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:06.124
 

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:08.126
was not done right, causing

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:08.126
 

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:11.363
cross contamination which

00:17:06.124 --> 00:17:11.363
 

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:11.997
means we have to fix it.

00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:11.997
 

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:13.932
And yet we paid $250.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.932
 

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.133
What do you think about what

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:15.133
 

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:16.134
they've done?

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:16.134
 

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:17.969
&gt;&gt; Certainly not right.

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:17.969
 

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.071
Certainly gives us in the

00:17:16.134 --> 00:17:19.071
 

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:21.506
industry a bad name.

00:17:17.969 --> 00:17:21.506
 

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:22.407
&gt;&gt; And it's certainly time to

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:22.407
 

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:23.341
get some answers.

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:23.341
 

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:24.276
&gt;&gt; Tom: Oh.

00:17:22.407 --> 00:17:24.276
 

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:25.043
&gt;&gt; What?

00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:25.043
 

00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:25.911
&gt;&gt; Tom: He's coming.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:25.911
 

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:27.446
So after the break, we show up

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:27.446
 

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.880
at Economy Lube's warehouse

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:28.880
 

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:30.115
uninvited.

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:30.115
 

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:31.884
Mr. Moxey, Tom Harrington from

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.884
 

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:31.884
"Marketplace."

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:31.884
 

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.884
(♪♪)

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.788
(♪♪)

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.930
&gt;&gt; Tom: Our investigation into

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.930
 

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:47.165
oil change shops run by

00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:47.165
 

00:17:43.428 --> 00:17:47.899
Economy Lube takes us to a

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.899
 

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:51.703
former investigator himself.

00:17:47.165 --> 00:17:51.703
 

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:52.671
&gt;&gt; Let me tell you a little

00:17:47.899 --> 00:17:52.671
 

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:53.772
bit about fraud.

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.772
 

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.274
&gt;&gt; Tom: Mark Simchison used to

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:56.274
 

00:17:52.738 --> 00:18:01.546
lead the major fraud division

00:17:53.772 --> 00:18:01.546
 

00:17:53.839 --> 00:18:02.414
of the Hamilton police.

00:17:56.274 --> 00:18:02.414
 

00:17:56.341 --> 00:18:03.682
at Economy Lube. we were sold

00:18:01.546 --> 00:18:03.682
 

00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:05.050
&gt;&gt; Tom: And what our expert

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:05.050
 

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:05.984
mechanic discovered.

00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:05.984
 

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:07.052
&gt;&gt; It hasn't been opened.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.052
 

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:08.854
That tells me that the

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:08.854
 

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:09.788
system's not flushed.

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:09.788
 

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:11.590
&gt;&gt; Tom: So what's his verdict?

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:11.590
 

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:12.991
&gt;&gt; I have told people all my

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:12.991
 

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:13.859
life that fraud is theft with

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.859
 

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:14.559
a smile.

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.559
 

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:15.861
&gt;&gt; Tom: Putting it right out

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:15.861
 

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:18.430
there, you're saying what

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:18.430
 

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:19.764
they're doing is fraud?

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:19.764
 

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:21.166
&gt;&gt; If they are charging for,

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.166
 

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:25.003
and accepting, money for and

00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:25.003
 

00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:27.506
receiving money for services

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:27.506
 

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:28.940
that they did not perform that

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:28.940
 

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.641
you paid for in all honesty,

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:29.641
 

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:31.309
that's fraud.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.309
 

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:32.043
&gt;&gt; Tom: And that's exactly

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:32.043
 

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:33.578
what we found.

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:33.578
 

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:37.516
Time to take our evidence to

00:18:32.043 --> 00:18:37.516
 

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:38.216
the top.

00:18:33.578 --> 00:18:38.216
 

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:39.217
(♪♪)

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:39.217
 

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.418
&gt;&gt; Tom: We're as close to the

00:18:38.216 --> 00:18:40.418
 

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:41.353
lot as we can possibly be so

00:18:39.217 --> 00:18:41.353
 

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:42.521
we can see the door.

00:18:40.418 --> 00:18:42.521
 

00:18:40.485 --> 00:18:43.855
We're outside Economy Lube

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.855
 

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.623
warehouse in Cambridge,

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:44.623
 

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:45.290
Ontario.

00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:45.290
 

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:46.892
&gt;&gt; He's in the car sitting.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:46.892
 

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.559
&gt;&gt; Tom: Is he really?

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.559
 

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:49.361
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.361
 

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:50.862
&gt;&gt; Tom: Looking for some

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:50.862
 

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:51.930
answers.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.930
 

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:53.231
Okay, he's gone in.

00:18:50.862 --> 00:18:53.231
 

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:54.399
We've already made repeated

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.399
 

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:56.535
requests for an on-camera

00:18:53.231 --> 00:18:56.535
 

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:57.536
interview with president and

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:57.536
 

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:58.470
founder Steve Moxey.

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.470
 

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:59.271
He's now inside.

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.271
 

00:18:57.603 --> 00:19:00.539
He backed in with his Range

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.539
 

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:01.239
Rover inside that closed door

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:01.239
 

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:02.140
garage door.

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.140
 

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:03.008
Given him weeks to think about

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:03.008
 

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:04.142
it.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.142
 

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.643
&gt;&gt; So if he sees the camera,

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:04.643
 

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.544
I don't think he'll come to

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:05.544
 

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:06.945
the door.

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.945
 

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.879
&gt;&gt; Tom: Right.

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.879
 

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:08.813
More details when requested.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:08.813
 

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:10.148
&gt;&gt; I don't know exactly how we

00:19:07.879 --> 00:19:10.148
 

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:11.683
should proceed because we're

00:19:08.813 --> 00:19:11.683
 

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.450
across the parking lot right

00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:12.450
 

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:14.052
now.

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:14.052
 

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.686
-- But Moxey still won't come

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.686
 

00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:15.287
on camera.

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:15.287
 

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.288
&gt;&gt; Tom: Oh.

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:16.288
 

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:17.289
&gt;&gt; What?

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.289
 

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:17.822
&gt;&gt; Tom: He's coming.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.822
 

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.723
&gt;&gt; Do you want to go get him,

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.723
 

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.324
Tom?

00:19:17.822 --> 00:19:19.324
 

00:19:17.889 --> 00:19:20.325
&gt;&gt; Tom: Yeah, why don't we

00:19:18.723 --> 00:19:20.325
 

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.359
try now.

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.359
 

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:22.827
So when we spot the man who

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.827
 

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:24.996
greases the wheels at Economy

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:24.996
 

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:25.797
Lube...

00:19:22.827 --> 00:19:25.797
 

00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:26.998
&gt;&gt; Okay here he comes, he's out.

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.998
 

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:28.466
Just go.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:28.466
 

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:29.568
Just go.

00:19:26.998 --> 00:19:29.568
 

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:30.869
&gt;&gt; Tom: We decide to roll.

00:19:28.466 --> 00:19:30.869
 

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:31.636
Mr. Moxey.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.636
 

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:32.804
But Steve Moxey --

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:32.804
 

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.972
Tom Harrington from

00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:33.972
 

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:35.040
"Marketplace."

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:35.040
 

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:37.142
-- doesn't want to talk about

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:37.142
 

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:41.813
why his company is ripping

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.813
 

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:42.581
people off.

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:42.581
 

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:44.349
(♪♪)

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.349
 

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.684
&gt;&gt; Tom: A few days later, we

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.684
 

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:46.851
reach Moxey by phone and

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:46.851
 

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:48.253
he denies any wrongdoing.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.253
 

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:49.588
&gt;&gt; I have a real hard time

00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:49.588
 

00:19:46.918 --> 00:19:51.089
believing that you took three

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:51.089
 

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.691
cars in and not one of those

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:52.691
 

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:54.059
cars actually had the service

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:54.059
 

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:55.427
done because I'm in stores

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:55.427
 

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:56.528
every day.

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:56.528
 

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:57.662
You know, I could be wrong,

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:57.662
 

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:58.830
you know, it's a hundred

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.830
 

00:19:56.595 --> 00:20:00.198
employees, anything's

00:19:57.662 --> 00:20:00.198
 

00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:01.800
possible.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.800
 

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:03.702
If it's in fact the case, I

00:20:00.198 --> 00:20:03.702
 

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:04.469
agree with anybody that that

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.469
 

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:05.737
is fraudulent.

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:05.737
 

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:07.305
&gt;&gt; Tom: We contact those

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:07.305
 

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:08.773
Economy Lube employees caught

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:08.773
 

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:10.842
by our hidden cameras.

00:20:07.305 --> 00:20:10.842
 

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:12.043
This one denies working on any

00:20:08.773 --> 00:20:12.043
 

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.245
of our test cars.

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:13.245
 

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:14.079
&gt;&gt; There you go, sir.

00:20:12.043 --> 00:20:14.079
 

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.213
&gt;&gt; Tom: But the other fesses

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:15.213
 

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:16.581
up.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:16.581
 

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:17.382
&gt;&gt; I'm not proud of it, but

00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:17.382
 

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.316
that's how we were taught to

00:20:16.581 --> 00:20:18.316
 

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:19.584
do stuff.

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.584
 

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:21.152
In that company, you are

00:20:18.316 --> 00:20:21.152
 

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:23.088
forced to rip people off

00:20:19.584 --> 00:20:23.088
 

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:24.289
basically because all the

00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:24.289
 

00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:26.524
owner's looking for is money.

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:26.524
 

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:28.526
If he's not making money, then

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:28.526
 

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:29.361
you're no use to him.

00:20:26.524 --> 00:20:29.361
 

00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:31.263
(♪♪)

00:20:28.526 --> 00:20:31.263
 

00:20:28.593 --> 00:20:32.197
&gt;&gt; Tom: As for lessons learned

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:32.197
 

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:33.765
in all this.

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.765
 

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.532
Here's a few tips from our

00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:34.532
 

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:36.101
"Marketplace" survival guide

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:36.101
 

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:36.935
the next time you need an oil

00:20:34.532 --> 00:20:36.935
 

00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:38.303
change.

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:38.303
 

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:40.272
Familiarize yourself with the

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:40.272
 

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:41.439
service schedule recommended

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:41.439
 

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.474
by your car's manufacturer.

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.474
 

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:44.242
They built your car, and

00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:44.242
 

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:45.210
probably know best when it

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:45.210
 

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:46.945
needs maintenance.

00:20:44.242 --> 00:20:46.945
 

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:47.879
Quick oil change shops are

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.879
 

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:49.080
fine for a quick oil change.

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:49.080
 

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:50.048
For anything bigger or

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:50.048
 

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:51.750
unexpected, stick with a

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.750
 

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:53.018
mechanic you know you can

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:53.018
 

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:55.820
trust.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.820
 

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:57.022
And finally, be on your toes

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:57.022
 

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:58.590
and know an upsell is coming.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.590
 

00:20:55.887 --> 00:21:00.025
That way you won't be caught

00:20:57.022 --> 00:21:00.025
 

00:20:57.089 --> 00:21:03.695
offguard by any greasy

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:03.695
 

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:03.695
business.
