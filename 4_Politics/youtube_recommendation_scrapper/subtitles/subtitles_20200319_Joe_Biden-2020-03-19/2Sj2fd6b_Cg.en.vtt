00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.705
I'm gonna pull this car
over for expired tags.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:09.442
It left from a
known drug location.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.544
There's a lot of
movement in the car.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.612
You want to 10-18?

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.254
How are you doing?

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.188
All right.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.557
Put your hands up
on here for me.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:25.525
How are you all doing?

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.493
Can you roll the
window down for me?

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.527
Huh?

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.862
Can you roll the
window down for me?

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.296
I'm a deputy from the
Sheriff's Department.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.931
I pulled you over because
your plates are expired

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.866
on the tags-- on your car.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.566
[horn honks]

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.267
Oh.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.335
Hold on.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.603
Do you have your
driver's license on you?

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.203
Whose car is this?

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.840
OK.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.841
Do you have any guns
or anything on you?

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:42.609
- No, sir.
- OK.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.610
Hop out.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.577
Do you have any weapons
on you, partner?

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:45.278
No, sir.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.479
Spin around.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.480
Your tags are expired.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.715
I need to talk to
you for a second.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.283
Can you just hang up the
phone so I can talk to you?

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.484
I gotta call you right back.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.253
Open your mouth for me.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.988
Open your mouth for me.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.356
Open your mouth for me.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.757
There ain't nothing in there.

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:58.658
Open your mouth.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.459
I'ma give it to you.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.427
I swear to god.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.528
Ask them what I do.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.729
I was picking my
teeth with plastic.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.830
- Open your mouth.
- I'm about to do it.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.664
There's nothing in there.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:05.432
Open your mouth.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.232
It's a piece of plastic.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.600
- Spit it out.
- Look.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.935
It's an empty piece of plastic.
There was nothing in there.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.336
6-9.
6-9.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.404
- There was nothing in there.
- You're just being detained.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.472
You're not under arrest.
OK?

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:13.273
OK.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.241
There was nothing in there.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.376
OK.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.544
We're going to have a K9
come over here and see

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.912
if we can get a hit on the car.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.892
The quicker we get
this done, the quicker we

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:34.260
can get on our way, so--

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.995
You're not going to give me--
you want me to run the dog?

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.096
- Get it out of the way, sir.
- OK.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:45.805
Huh?

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.445
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.680
Took the seat off.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.715
He bit it off

00:01:55.715 --> 00:02:01.020
So the dog positively alerted
on the vehicle, as we can see.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.755
And we're going to
search the vehicle,

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:05.358
and any remnants
inside, and try and find

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.461
some sort of narcotics, or what
the cause of the alert was.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.529
That would be why my dog bit.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.530
No, it's not.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.397
Yes it is.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:12.332
Listen, that's
a laxative, sir.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.066
You're going to
want to test that.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:13.900
Test it.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.368
It's a laxative, I swear to god.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.069
Look at it.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.537
It's too gritty.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.006
That's a laxative, sir.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.342
Looks like a
sawed-off shotgun, here.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.743
And it's loaded.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:24.344
12 gauge.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.883
You're free to go.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.851
You're under arrest,
and you're under arrest.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.420
The backseat passenger, he
didn't have anything on him.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.488
He was released.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.024
The front passenger,
he went for the gun

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.259
that was up under the seat.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.094
And then the driver has
warrants, and is prohibited

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.062
from being around firearms.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.497
He's going for that, as well.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.432
The bag that was in
his mouth, I think

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.801
it was some sort
of ecstasy or MDMA,

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.570
because he started
sweating really bad.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.604
He was very jittery.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:52.972
We're going to
test the substance,

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.174
and see if we can
identify what it is.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.911
[dramatic music]

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.584
We got some
apartments over here,

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:08.154
pretty infested with some
drug activity, gang activity.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:11.925
We just had a shooting
out here the other night.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.593
We got one walking
in a white t-shirt.

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.495
I'm gonna go around
to the other side.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.430
We got one cutting through
this building, right here.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.031
I'm gonna get over.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.613
Right now, for you.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.481
Why are you coming
from up there?

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:36.482
I live over here.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.617
OK.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.452
I thought there was a
cut through here, to get

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.386
to the store right there.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.521
Oh, to get to the store?

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.221
OK.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.456
All right.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.459
Who are you looking for?

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.760
Were you smoking
weed, just now?

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.895
No.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.196
There was, uh, a black
guy that was over there.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.030
He was smoking weed.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.965
Where was he at?

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.199
He went through
that neighborhood.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.200
OK.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.168
You don't have
anything on you, right?

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:56.436
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.937
I can smell it coming off you.
Come here.

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.038
Come here.
- No, it's not coming off me.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.206
Kelly, you want to
check her real quick?

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.074
I'm gonna go check that.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.408
Oh, lord, are y'all serious?

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.409
Hey, check her.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.344
Do you have anything
on you, ma'am?

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:05.411
Yes or no?

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.579
No.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.313
Stop.

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.147
OK.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.882
Please do not grab me like that.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.150
Well, when I ask
you to stop, then--

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.819
I don't have
nothing in my pockets.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.754
--that means stop.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:15.355
Yeah, you do.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:18.691
That's nothing.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.327
That's a cigarette.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.395
Mmm, smells like weed to me.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.397
No, that's a cigarette.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.231
Smells like weed to me.

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.065
Did you get it?

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.200
What am I being arrested for?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.368
You're not being
arrested, ma'am.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:29.569
You're being
detained, right now.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.271
For what?

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:33.539
For what?

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.641
- I'm gonna ask you a question.
- What's the question?

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:35.575
- It's a simple question.
- Yes?

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:36.509
Do you smoke weed?

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.410
I don't smoke weed.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.811
We can smell it-- listen.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.680
We smelled it coming off of you
when you walked down the hill.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.148
There was a black
guy that was--

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.650
he went right through
that neighborhood.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.784
Did he put this
in your pocket?

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:45.718
I don't know what he did.
He was right here.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:46.419
He was--

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.220
Did he put this in--

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.987
He was trying to fondle me.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.088
Right there.

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.089
And I said, boy, you
better leave me alone.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.224
I'm going to see my boyfriend.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:52.925
I'm trying to find the
best cut through here.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.761
You got dope on you.

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.962
You got--

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.897
We saw you walking down
the hill all by yourself.

00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.232
Yeah, she put it
out right there.

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:00.299
He went over there.

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.502
Right over by that
mailbox, right there.

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:03.770
I'm just being detained.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.338
I'd like to be released,
unless I've committed a crime.

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.472
No.
You know what?

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.240
You're under arrest.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.441
For what?

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.709
Loitering for purpose of
narcotics and possession

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.177
of marijuana.
- I don't have any narcotics.

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:12.145
You got marijuana.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.012
That-- that's not mine.

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.213
Where did it come from?

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.682
I told you, it was that
black guy with the dreads.

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:16.716
All right, cool.

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:17.684
Why don't you work
on real criminals?

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:18.818
They need to come--

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.653
You're out here smoking
dope around these kids.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.288
You see what type of
police work they're doing.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.057
They don't even go after
the real criminals.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.024
Seriously.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.092
I haven't committed a crime.
- Walk.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.326
- I'm telling you right now.
- Walk.

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.361
I have not committed a crime.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.595
Walk.

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.496
Do not use force on me.
You understand me, [bleep].

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:31.731
I'm not, trust me.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:39.572
[bleep] [bleep] [bleep]
Look at this [bleep],, man!

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.907
Hey-- uh-uh, don't run up.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.442
There was a black guy that
was selling weed back there,

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:43.443
and they arrested me.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.677
Hey, come here.
I'll talk to you.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.378
Come here.

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:46.245
Come here.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:46.946
I'll talk to you.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:47.780
Come here, man.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.815
Come here, man.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:49.816
You know her?

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.617
Hey-- hey, check this out, man.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.086
She was up top of the
hill, smoking a blunt.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.520
There was nobody with her.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.789
She was up there smoking
a roach of marijuana.

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.491
And then she gonna
make up this game.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.692
We were watching
her the whole time.

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.960
There wasn't nobody around her.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.229
She's got the weed
in her pocket.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.697
She shouldn't be out
here smoking marijuana.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.232
So she's gonna take that ride.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.601
And had she not turned
it the way she turned it,

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.636
she would've been given a ticket
and got bounced out of here.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.205
But because she started
acting the way she did,

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:12.972
we've got to take her.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.107
There's just no way.

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:16.042
So-- she'll be out in
a couple hours, though.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:18.511
I feel like I'm being
persecuted for being

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:19.746
white in a black neighborhood.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.446
Really.

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:21.447
Seriously.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.850
I mean, this is
reverse discrimination.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.818
Reverse discrimination
in Richland County.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.320
I thought Lexington
County was bad,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.355
but they do not do this
[bleep] like over in Richland.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.590
I saw y'all doing
your police work.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.891
I walked the opposite way.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.659
Because I didn't want
to disturb y'all.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.528
Because I have respect
for what you're doing,

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:36.729
and I appreciate it.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.464
But when you go about
doing business like this,

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:39.365
this is ridiculous.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:42.101
I got first amendment rights.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.936
I have a right to speak my mind.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:46.572
If you check for footprints,
you will notice footprints

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:49.242
leaving from there of a man.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.410
And if you check that
neighborhood right there,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.845
you'll see that
somebody left the scene.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.380
OK.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.015
And so you're arresting
the wrong person.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:57.116
OK.

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:58.451
It was in your pocket,
in your possession.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.919
Sir, I can't help--

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.621
You're being charged
with the possession.

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.688
Of what?

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.056
The marijuana that
was in your pocket.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.057
What?

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:06.826
How much marijuana
is in there, sir?

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.427
What is that?

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:09.896
I was told it was a cigarette.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.264
That's all I know.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.431
You were told it
was a cigarette?

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:14.700
So you put cigarette
butts in your pocket?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.969
Yeah, I do-- when
I'm running low.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.905
She gonna go for
at least loitering

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.607
and then for possession
of that marijuana.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:24.010
And all this drama
for no reason.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.411
I'll buy you breakfast
one day, Brown.

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.380
I forgive you, man.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.048
She probably would've
walked away with a ticket,

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.616
had she not started
screaming all that stuff.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.560
[sirens blaring]

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.029
[engine accelerating]

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.398
We got a call for shots fired.

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:47.166
We're just gonna go out there
and see what we can find.

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:54.540
[dramatic music]

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:09.322
[radio chatter]

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.330
Look for any--

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.548
[knocks on door]

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:41.554
[exhales]

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.890
[knocking continues]

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:47.560
Oh.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.160
Hey, Hardy.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.600
Richland County
Sheriff's Department!

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:02.441
424 Amherst Ave. Suspect down.

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.011
Send an ambulance.

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:05.778
Two down.

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:08.948
Two down.

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.082
Sheriff's Department!

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:10.816
Hey!

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:11.517
Sheriff's Department!

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.319
Show me your hands!

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.655
Show me your hands, right now!

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:16.555
Who else is in the house?

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:17.790
Who else is in here?

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.327
Um, just me and a roommate.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:23.229
Stop right there,
and don't move.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.168
Everybody OK?

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.070
I just want to--

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.571
Can you-- are you
good back there?

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:33.439
Good.

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:34.206
All right.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:34.907
Walk this way.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.908
Is he OK?

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.310
He's just on the
ground, right now.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.012
We're going to check him out.

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:40.780
Step over.
- Is he OK?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.881
Please--

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:42.848
- Step-- step over.
- Step outside, ma'am.

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:43.683
Step over.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.084
What the [bleep] is going on?

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.223
We're figuring it out,
right now, but in the--

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:54.193
What the [bleep] is going on?

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:56.429
So you didn't hear
anything going on in there?

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.197
[sobbing] No.

00:09:58.197 --> 00:09:59.398
Until we get
things figured out,

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:00.633
I'm just going to have
you sitting in the car.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.334
It's safer there.

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:02.301
OK?

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.402
[sobbing]

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:04.003
Have a seat.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:10.309
Those guys that
are in the house--

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.143
OK.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.311
--who are they to you?

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:13.112
My roommates.

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:14.180
Your roommates?

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.348
How many roommates,
total, do you have?

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.183
Two.

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:19.151
We got-- we got
two down inside.

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:19.852
What?

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.620
Uh--

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.322
She been hit, or--

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.458
No, she-- she was asleep,
apparently, through the whole

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.560
thing, in the back room.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.562
Please tell me they're OK.

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.764
So we're figuring
that out now.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:32.531
OK?

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.000
You didn't hear anything?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.867
You don't know anything?

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:36.202
No.

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:40.239
You don't know anybody that
they might be enemies with?

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:41.440
They were--

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.642
I thought they were
arguing for a short second,

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:45.678
but I thought they got over it.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:48.481
[siren approaching]

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.691
There was a bunch of green
plant material on the ground

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:00.359
that we believe to be marijuana.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:03.329
It could have possibly been
a bad drug transaction.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.164
We're still figuring
that out, right now.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.499
What do you got inside?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.135
We got two individuals
that are on the ground,

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:11.904
apparent gunshot wounds.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:12.838
Unresponsive.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.775
The last I saw,
EMS was doing CPR.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:18.010
Both of them had guns
right in their reach.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.845
The dude behind the door
still had the gun in his hand,

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:20.513
finger on the trigger.

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:29.088
EMS-- they came in
and performed CPR.

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:31.223
After checking for a
pulse, checking for life,

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:32.625
found out they were deceased.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.360
So we have two individuals
that are deceased

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.828
right now inside the home.

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:38.597
[dramatic music]

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:46.672
So we're just about ready
to pull up on a shoplifting,

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:48.240
largely in progress.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.678
Got an update that the
individual is still inside.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:53.412
Said all black.

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:10.696
How's it going?

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.565
Him, right here?

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.799
Him, right here?

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.500
Yeah.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.534
We-- we have a camera.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:16.635
Get your hands out
your pockets, bud.

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:17.736
In the video.

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:20.806
I can show you on the
camera what he did.

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:23.776
I work hard for my money.

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:26.745
I work hard-- 12
hours, seven days.

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.280
And I don't take nobody money.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.548
I don't want to be--

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:31.750
I don't-- I don't want nobody
take money or my stuff.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:35.688
Why you not asking me?

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:36.455
I would give it to you!

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:37.156
I understand that.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.057
I understand that now.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:38.891
Sometimes you--

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:39.725
I'm sorry.

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:40.693
I'm not trying to be no trouble.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:41.961
You didn't know
it was like that?

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.330
You didn't know it was
illegal to take something

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.999
that don't belong to you
and put it in your pocket,

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:47.800
and try to-- no.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.201
Don't apologize to me, sir.

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:49.802
You--

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:54.006
I could show you
the camera, right now.

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.441
I mean, from both sides.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.611
He grabbed two sausage from
here, and go to the back,

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.411
put them in the back.

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:01.247
And he come back, take--

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.649
take two of these--

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:08.287
take two of these, and put
one back, and one behind him.

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.557
If he want to go to jail for
$4 candy, sometime he ask me.

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:13.993
I give him a dollar.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:15.561
You not worth it,
go to jail for $4.

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:18.063
If you ask me, I would pay you.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.732
I would-- I would
give you a credit.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.000
No.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.835
You steal my [bleep],, you're
gonna go to jail for it.

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:24.003
Did you come here
to steal that--

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:24.937
- Yes, sir.
- Why did you do that?

00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:25.538
Why did you do that?

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:39.652
That whole day, I'm working
at [muted],, walking around.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:40.619
Well, understand that--

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:41.754
I'm going to-- I
gotta ask him again.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:42.821
OK?

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:44.190
But he said he wanted
to press charges.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.391
All right?

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:46.559
So with that being said,
you're going to be placed

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.494
under arrest for larceny.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.261
For petty larceny.

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.696
OK?

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:51.564
I'll be right back.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:52.164
All right.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:00.506
Watch your feet.

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:10.249
I give him money.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.183
No problem.

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:12.384
Oh, it's-- it's too late, sir.

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:15.721
I can't-- I can't un-arrest
somebody, unfortunately.

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:16.422
I know.

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:17.122
I know.

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:19.091
Just he-- he go--

00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:19.692
Yes, sir.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.595
[non-english speech]
- You need to come out?

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:23.395
You can come out.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:26.265
Let's stand off to the side.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.167
Um, I understand.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.301
I really do.

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:31.103
I understand what you--
what you mean by that.

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:32.137
OK?

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:33.806
But since a crime
has been committed,

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.774
and he said that he
wants to press charges,

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.009
I can't un-arrest somebody.

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.244
OK?

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:43.649
So maybe-- you know, hopefully--

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.951
Well, that's your right,
and you'd have to talk

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:46.885
to the judge about that.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:47.586
OK?

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:48.887
But right now, I--

00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:49.922
I can't change that.

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:50.923
OK?

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:51.857
So unfortunately,
it is what it is.

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:52.558
OK?
All right.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:53.259
Yeah.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:54.093
You got it.

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:54.793
Yep.

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:55.861
You got it.

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.062
We're not in the
business of un-arresting.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.530
It doesn't-- it
doesn't work that way.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.832
So unfortunately, I
wish they would've

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:02.801
said that sooner, for his sake.

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:04.770
He doesn't have a
bad criminal record.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.206
He just seems to be
in a bad situation.

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:08.474
He just made a bad
decision today.

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:13.812
[sirens blaring]

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.649
[radio chatter]

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:20.185
Headed to a incident
where an individual

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.221
shot into a residence.

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:26.058
One of the projectiles actually
went through the garage door.

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.193
The caller stated she
heard three gunshots.

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.265
Smells like gunpowder here.

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:41.240
[dog yapping]

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:41.940
Hey.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.675
How you doing, ma'am?

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:43.442
Did you call?

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.543
Yes, I called.

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:46.779
I heard, like, pop pops.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.347
Did you hear where they
might be coming from?

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:49.081
Like, over there?

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.349
Over there?

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.384
I-- I don't know exactly
where it was coming from,

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:54.953
because when I-- the garage
door was closed, and I was

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:56.188
getting things out of my car.

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:57.256
OK.

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.891
And I just didn't
know what hit the door.

00:15:58.891 --> 00:15:59.892
You know?
- OK.

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:00.993
So it hit this garage
door, over here?

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:01.960
Yes, sir.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.329
That's what I heard
the sound from.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:05.164
OK.

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:08.033
[dramatic music]

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:14.039
I can see where the
bullet hit the brick.

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.411
But again, you don't
know exactly where they

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:20.379
might have been coming from?

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.080
No, sir.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.847
I don't know.

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:23.148
OK.

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:23.849
All right.

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:24.450
That's good.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.924
What are you doing
coming from back there?

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:32.758
Your front door?

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.760
Where are you headed to?

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.961
Go ahead and
turn around for me.

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:36.929
Keep your hands out your pocket.

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.901
Come here.

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:43.936
What's in your
front right pocket?

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:47.439
What's in your--

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.507
What's in your
front right pocket?

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.142
[mumbling]

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.878
What's in your
front right pocket?

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.880
There is a gun?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.315
All right.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:56.949
Exactly what I thought.

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.988
You have a CWP?

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.223
All right.

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.391
Well, now you're under
arrest for unlawful carrying

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.091
of a pistol.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:06.892
You understand?

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.564
Have a seat for me.

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:15.200
Can you get his information
and start running him, please?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.036
Are you allowed
to have a firearm?

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:21.039
So you're going to be a
felon in possession, as well?

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:22.141
All right.
Sounds good.

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:23.242
You don't want to
talk to me at all?

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:28.113
Huh?

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:29.114
You want a lawyer?

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:29.815
OK.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:30.416
Sounds good.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.219
It's going to be a Bersa 380.

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.521
So we'll run the serial number.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.891
Hopefully, it doesn't come
back stolen, but if it does,

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.360
then it's going to be
another charge for him.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.796
He's out here just playing
around with the gun,

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.597
and shooting at stuff, and
shooting people's houses.

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:48.233
It's pretty dangerous, so we're
gonna nip that in the bud,

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.068
real quick.

00:17:50.068 --> 00:17:51.637
We're going to go ahead
and take the projectile

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:54.673
and put it into evidence, and
let investigations process,

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:56.041
and see what they
can get from it,

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.409
and see if it's a
connection with the gun

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.211
that we found on
this individual.

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.712
We got him off the
streets, so you don't have

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:02.014
to worry about,
hopefully, nothing else

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:04.016
happening tonight, or any time--

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:04.850
Uh, no, ma'am.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:05.851
He doesn't live here.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.052
He doesn't live around here.
No.

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:07.920
So-- so--

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:11.857
Yes, ma'am.

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.125
In further investigation,
that pistol

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:17.129
is stolen from a business,
along with 11 other pistols

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:19.298
that are still outstanding.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.599
So this individual
is being charged

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:23.735
with possession of a stolen
pistol and unlawful carry.

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:27.072
He also has a warrant out of
North Carolina for probation,

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.274
so he's going to be transferred
up to North Carolina

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:31.143
after these charges.
