This season, it's fantastic.

I've been noticing that
you've been getting a lot

of the presidential candidates

-Yeah.
I mean, well, there's 23 people

-It's like they're going

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.245
to trickle in
on your show at some point.

There's a guy named Tom Steyer
running for president.

He's not your high school

[ Laughter ]

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.362

He really messed it up.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.766
You could have just bought
your way for us to know that,

-Yeah, he came on our show.
-Yeah, and he sat down and he's

like, "Hasan, I got to go,"
and I was like, "Why?"

basketball with Jimmy Fallon."

-I'm not putting you
on the spot like that.
