00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.650
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.870
On the "NewsHour" tonight: at war with an
invisible enemy. The U.S. hunkers down to

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.170
fight the spread of COVID-19, closing the
border to Canada, as lawmakers move to provide

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.000
financial relief, while the economic fallout
worsens.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.611
Then: the coming crisis. The U.S. medical
community braces for the worst-case scenario:

00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:32.110
a cascade of patients and a shortage of hospital
beds.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:42.649
Plus: songs of comfort. World-renowned cellist
Yo-Yo Ma on the healing power of music in

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:43.870
a time of global fear.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.000
YO-YO MA, Cellist: A virus is something that
travels globally, it knows no borders, no

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.489
walls, no boundaries. And music is something
that actually looks into the inside. And that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.129
also knows no boundaries.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.000
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:03:00.000
(BREAK)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.451
JUDY WOODRUFF: The coronavirus pandemic is
hitting new highs and lows tonight. Infections

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:12.770
in the U.S. have jumped to 7,700 confirmed
cases, with 133 reported deaths.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.200
And another wave of selling overwhelmed Wall
Street, as the Dow industrials fell 6 percent.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.180
Meanwhile, President Trump invoked new powers
to address the crisis.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.420
We begin with this report from William Brangham.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.530
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:
It's the invisible enemy. That's always the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.120
toughest enemy, the invisible enemy, but we
are going to defeat the invisible enemy.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.540
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President Trump, describing
the fight against the coronavirus as a war,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.890
announced new sweeping measures to mobilize
the country.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.379
DONALD TRUMP: So we will be invoking the We'll
be invoking the Defense Production Act.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.180
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Defense Production Act
was first enacted during the Korean War, and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.299
it allows the government to force companies
to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.569
critical for national defense.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.610
This also comes as public health officials
warned that the official count of confirmed

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.790
infections will shoot up dramatically in coming
days.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.380
Dr. Deborah Birx, who's helping coordinate
the response, says this is because much quicker

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.680
viral testing is starting to roll out.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.570
DR. DEBORAH BIRX, White House Coronavirus
Response Coordinator: We will see the number

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.521
of people diagnosed dramatically increase
over the next four to five days. I know some

00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:29.889
of you will use that to raise an alarm that
we are worse than Italy because of our slope

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:30.889
of our curve.

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.050
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Birx also urged young
Americans to follow CDC and White House guidelines

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.770
and avoid large gatherings, like here on Miami
Beach today, even if they feel fine and show

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.100
no obvious symptoms.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.130
DR. DEBORAH BIRX: I'm not only calling on
you to heed what's in the guidance, but to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.220
really ensure that each and every one of you
are protecting each other.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.780
And so we cannot have these large gatherings
that continue to occur throughout the country,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.020
for people who are off work to then be socializing
in large groups and spreading the virus.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.400
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President Trump today also
announced today that the Department of Housing

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.419
and Urban Development will not enforce evictions
or foreclosures until April.

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.740
WOMAN: The bill is passed.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.280
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And on the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States Senate

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.970
approved a $100 billion coronavirus response
bill. The bill, negotiated between Treasury

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.690
Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, contains emergency funds to

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.520
provide sick pay for workers and free viral
testing.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.750
It is Congress' latest legislative step, as
it also considers ways to provide relief for

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.180
small businesses and for workers and to stabilize
the roller-coaster financial markets.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.630
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The men and women
who pour their entire lives into small businesses

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.940
do not need even more obstacles. They need
help. They need a lifeline. They need to know

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.390
that Congress understands the historic obstacles
they're facing, and that we have their back

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.390
as well.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.750
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Senate Minority Leader
Chuck Schumer said this pandemic demands an

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.229
even greater response.

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.900
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Democrats are proposing
a Marshall Plan for our public health infrastructure.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.910
The sooner we act on it, the better.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.770
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile, President Trump
and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.120
announced today the U.S.-Canada border will
be closed to nonessential travel.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.610
Trudeau spoke from his home in Ottawa.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.050
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, Canadian Prime Minister: These
measures will last in place as long we feel

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.150
that they need to last.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.350
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President Trump said today
the U.S. is not moving to close down the border

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.350
with Mexico.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.479
And across the United States today, daily
lives remain stalled. There are now confirmed

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:50.730
infections in all 50 states. The normally
busy Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco is

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.199
empty, after local officials ordered roughly
eight million Californians to shelter in place.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:03.110
Here, a shopping mall in suburban Virginia
closed indefinitely. Domestic air travel is

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.759
collapsing, too. This is a terminal at Salt
Lake City's airport two weeks ago. And here

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:16.099
it is on Monday. And the same with American
car manufacturing. Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:20.690
are all suspending production at U.S. plants
until March 30.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.639
In Las Vegas, America's gambling mecca has
gone quiet, after the state took the unprecedented

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:34.070
move last night of closing businesses, including
hotels and casinos, in the state for 30 days.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.070
Governor Steve Sisolak:

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.419
GOV. STEVE SISOLAK (D-NV): This is only common
sense. At a time when people are getting sick

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:45.910
from simply being near others is not the time
for gyms to remain open. This is not the time

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.440
for casinos to remain open.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.010
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And other nations around
the world are taking similar measures, shutting

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:56.400
down public spaces to limit the spread of
this virus.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.830
In Antwerp, empty train stations and streets,
as Belgium's prime minister today joined many

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.539
European leaders and implemented a nationwide
lockdown.

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:09.770
SOPHIE WILMES, Belgian Prime Minister (through
translator): Citizens are required to stay

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.330
at home in order to avoid maximum contact
outside their immediate family, except to

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.790
go to work, essential travel, going to the
doctor, the grocery store, the post office,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.280
the bank, the pharmacy, to get fuel or to
help people in need.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.139
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But traffic jams stretched
for miles across other parts of Europe today,

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:33.000
including the German-Polish border, after
the European Union yesterday announced it

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.100
is closing their external borders to non-E.U.
citizens.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:45.140
And in hard-hit Italy, nearly 30,000 people
have now tested positive, and over 2,500 people

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.140
have died.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.740
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm William Brangham.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.720
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn again to our Lisa
Desjardins and Yamiche Alcindor.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.500
Yamiche, to you, first.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:03.270
The president today invoked the Defense Production
Act. He also enacted border restrictions.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.270
What do we know about how these measures are
going to be used to fight this virus?

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.940
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: The president today said
that he sees himself as a wartime president.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.400
And with that in mind, he said he was taking
several emergency steps needed to stem the

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.750
flow and stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.
So he said he was going to be signing the

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.390
Defense Production Act.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.360
Now, this act would allow the federal government
to direct American manufacturers to produce

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.550
items needed to fight the virus, including
masks or gloves or gowns. Now, the president

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.640
said he signed that just in case he had to
invoke it in worst-case scenario. Only a few

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.700
minutes ago, he tweeted that.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.061
So, it isn't that this is happening right
now. The other thing to note, though, what

00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:47.700
is happening right now is that the president
is putting in new travel restrictions for

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.710
the northern and southern border. That's the
borders with Canada in Mexico.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.420
Here's a bit of what the president is going
to be doing and is doing just put up there.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.320
The president is going to be enforcing something
that is an immediate removal of anyone who's

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.610
crossing those borders that are undocumented.
People aren't going to take being taken to

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.590
facilities or courts. There's going to be
no due process.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.100
People are just going to be immediately removed.
The other thing is, the people that are exempt

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.570
are Americans and Canadians and people with
proper documents. That means people with green

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.160
cards or with work permits. They're going
to be allowed to come in.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.630
And, last, this does not include goods and
trade. The president made it clear today that

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.350
he doesn't want this to impact the trade with
Mexico and Canada. But there are people, of

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.210
course, that are pushing back, saying that
this is unlawful.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.530
But the president and the Trump administration
say they're happy and willing to fight this

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.000
in court, if needed, because they say that
this is a public health need and that the

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.110
borders need to be shut down, at least to
the people that I just described.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.890
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yamiche, today at the briefing
at the White House, you asked the president

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:51.400
how the White House is characterizing this
virus and how long it's going to last.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.570
Tell us about that exchange and what he said.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:59.020
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, the president has
been getting pushback for using the term Chinese

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.110
virus.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.750
And there was also a White House official
who referred to the coronavirus as kung flu.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.500
So I questioned the president about whether
or not he thought those terms were wrong.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.920
Here's what he said.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.170
QUESTION: A person at the White House used
the...

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.550
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:
No, just the term.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.050
QUESTION: ... term Kung flu. My question is...

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.650
DONALD TRUMP: Kung flu?

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.920
QUESTION: ... do you think that's wrong? Kung
flu. And do you think using the term Chinese

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.760
virus, that that puts Asian Americans at risk,
that people might target them?

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.720
DONALD TRUMP: No, not at all. No, not at all.
I think they probably would agree with it

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.640
100 percent. It comes from China. There's
nothing not to agree on.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.250
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Now, the president said
that he wants to continue to use the word

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.650
and term Chinese virus because he thinks,
yes, this virus started in China. He also

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.430
says China was trying to blame the United
States and U.S. service members for the virus

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.430
starting in China.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.440
The other thing to note is, I questioned the
president about whether or not the coronavirus

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.440
outbreak in the United States might last as
long as 18 months. That's what some reports

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.710
have been saying. The president said that's
not correct. He doesn't think it's going to

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.710
last that long.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.860
But Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin did say
that the unemployment rate could go up to

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.080
20 percent. That, of course, would be a big,
big number. And people are very, very worried

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.560
about that, but the president saying the federal
government is doing all that it can do so

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.620
that those things will not happen.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.290
JUDY WOODRUFF: Interesting.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.750
And so, Lisa, now over to you. Things are
moving really fast at the Capitol in terms

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.140
of figuring out ways to help people, to help
businesses.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.740
Tell us where everything stands right now.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.690
LISA DESJARDINS: Judy, I think, overall, think
of the Capitol as a place that is trying to

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:31.450
shore up a dam that is cracking in the middle
of an earthquake.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.520
They are trying to deal with now layoffs starting
to come in with -- to the economy, at the

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.440
same time as they know future problems are
going to be worse. And they're not sure what

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.080
tools exactly can fix these problems.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.331
So let's go over exactly where we are. First
of all, today, as William reported, the Senate

00:12:48.331 --> 00:12:53.190
passed the Families First Act. That goes to
the president now. A reminder again, that

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:57.561
helps deal with sick time for people who have
the virus or are quarantined, and family leave

00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:01.450
for those caring for children at home, as
well as testing and some food aid.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:07.060
Now, what's next is that $1 trillion stimulus
plan. It could be more than a trillion dollars,

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.080
Judy. And today, as Republicans gathered to
try and figure out their plan, outside came

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.860
a new idea from Senators Lindsey Graham and
Mitt Romney. They would like to focus on unemployment

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.800
insurance to the tune, Judy, of perhaps 75
percent of people's salaries, up to $80,000.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.660
That's just one idea. But it looks like that
idea of looking out for those who lose their

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.760
jobs is emerging as a top factor in any of
the next plans.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:39.010
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, on the part of that that
addresses small businesses, what do you see

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.340
emerging there?

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.560
LISA DESJARDINS: This seems to be the most
clear consensus point in all of the parties,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.300
is that small businesses who may already be
worried about going out of business this week

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.330
need more help.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.760
There is a plan emerging from Senators Rubio
and Collins in the Republican Party that would

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.810
actually -- they would give federal loans
to those small businesses to help them continue

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.810
to operate.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:06.100
So long as those businesses use that money
for payroll and operations, Judy, this plan

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.860
would later forgive those loans, essentially
make this a grant to perhaps thousands and

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:16.390
thousands of small businesses around the country.
The cost of that Judy, $300 billion.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.710
But there is clear concern for small businesses,
more than almost any other sector of the economy

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.590
right now here in the U.S. Capitol.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.890
JUDY WOODRUFF: So interesting.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.730
All right, so I want to ask both of you, quickly,
because you have both been reporting on this.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:35.730
And that is Bernie Sanders. Obviously, he
came in behind in these latest primaries that

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.290
took place yesterday.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.510
Both of you have been in touch with his campaign.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.750
Yamiche, what are you hearing about what his
next plans are?

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.740
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Well, the Bernie Sanders
campaign and the senator himself have been

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.600
pushing back very hard on the idea that he
is ending his campaign any time soon. They

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.150
said that any reports of that are false.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.730
I have been talking to sources that are close
to Bernie Sanders who say that he recognizes

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.530
that his path is nearly impossible to winning
the nomination, but that he wants to look

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.320
at how he can possibly push Joe Biden further
to the left and push some more progressive

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.320
ideals.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.410
But, today, the senator was very, very angry,
in a way that I haven't seen him in the years

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:17.170
that I have been covering him, because he
even sent an expletive to a reporter who was

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.830
asking him about whether or not he would be
ending his campaign sometime soon.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.950
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa?

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:22.950
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.410
And, Judy, I was there, actually. That was
part of a conversation I was having with Senator

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.640
Sanders. I asked Senator Sanders for comments
on the race. He said, no comment.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.060
I moved on to ask him about the pandemic.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.130
He had a lengthy conversation with me, I think
the longest he's spoken to a reporter in a

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.700
few days, about his concerns with the pandemic.
That's obviously a top priority to him.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.670
Other reporters joined in, asked him again
about the race, asked him repeatedly. And

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:51.080
that was when he had that pushback. He's turned
to them and said, why are you asking me this?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.400
We're in the middle of a -- and then he used
a strong word -- crisis.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.000
Now, it seems to me that he obviously is very
focused on the crisis. I asked him about the

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.560
election and the crisis. And that clearly
is on his mind too. He has a lot of concerns

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.100
about how the election goes forward.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:10.160
What he himself does, unclear, but he is factoring
in the pandemic into all of his thoughts.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160
That much, we can say.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.060
JUDY WOODRUFF: The only thing better than
having one of you reporting on Bernie Sanders

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.160
is having both of you reporting on him.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160
(LAUGHTER)

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Lisa. And thank
you, Yamiche.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:32.670
JUDY WOODRUFF: We appreciate it.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:38.260
Economic damage from this virus keeps piling
up, amid talk of sweeping financial aid.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.670
The Dow Jones industrial average, as we reported,
crashed again today, losing more than 1,300

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:53.630
points, to close below 19,900. The Nasdaq
fell 345 points, and the S&amp;P 500 gave up 131.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:58.120
For insight into all of this, I'm joined once
again by David Wessel, director of the Hutchins

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.590
Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the
Brookings Institution.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.230
David, welcome back to the program.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.640
So it seems that, no matter what Congress
does -- and we have heard from Lisa reporting

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.360
on that -- the markets, the investors just
don't seem to be reassured. Is that what's

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360
going on?

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.360
DAVID WESSEL, Brookings Institution: Right.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.589
I think that what we're seeing is the markets
and investors are -- A, they're talking -- they're

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:25.350
realizing there's a lot of uncertainty. Secondly,
they're extremely risk-averse. No one wants

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.640
to hold any risky assets.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.990
And they're thinking that this might go on
for a while, and it might do some long-lasting

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:38.020
harm to the economy. It seems like an overreaction,
but without any clear idea if this is going

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.700
to be two quarters, three quarters or four
quarters, I think people are really just panicking.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.720
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were sharing with us
that you have seen some forecasts that came

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.200
out today, which contribute to the panic.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.200
DAVID WESSEL: Absolutely.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.570
J.P. Morgan, a big bank on Wall Street, their
economists predicted that the second quarter

00:17:54.570 --> 00:18:00.890
of the year will see a decline in the U.S.
GDP at a 14 percent annual rate. We have never

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.320
had a quarter that bad since we started keeping
track of quarterly GDP in 1947.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.210
Now, I should note that they expect a bounce-back
in the third quarter. I hope they're right.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.230
But we really don't know how long this is
going to go on.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.630
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do they, do we have a sense
at this point of which sectors are going to

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.630
be the hardest-hit?

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.700
I'm asking because we're hearing small businesses,
big businesses laying off, shutting down,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.990
at least for the time being?

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.960
DAVID WESSEL: Well, when you basically tell
everybody to stay home, it's not hard to imagine

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:36.220
which businesses suffer first, hotels, terrorism,
airlines, and stuff like that.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.920
But I think that it's going to be widespread.
And one of the problems that the government's

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.300
going to have is, every business is going
to be able to say, we're hurting, and it's

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.300
not our fault.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.950
So they're going to have to make some tough
decisions about who to help, who not to help,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.770
how to get paid back, who gets a grant, and
who gets a loan.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.201
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does it take at a
time like this? And I realize what you're

00:18:57.201 --> 00:19:00.280
saying is, we have never seen anything like
this.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.370
What does it take, though, at a time like
this to give people some sense of reassurance,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.870
I mean, to know, there is a bottom here?

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:12.160
DAVID WESSEL: Well, I think one of the challenges
of this event is that, by flattening the curve,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.570
by spreading out the virus, we're doing, on
purpose, damage to the economy. And that's

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.480
going to be very upsetting to people.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.970
I think people want leadership. They want
confidence, if they get sick, they can get

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.200
-- be treated. And they want to be able to
pay the rent, or pay the light bill and stuff

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.200
like that.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.210
And that's why there's a lot of talk about
providing cash to households, giving money

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:39.260
to people who may be furloughed, strengthening
the safety net, in order to make sure that

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.110
the most vulnerable among us don't really
get hit hard.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.800
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much does it help?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.950
I mean, this is, I think, part of your answer,
that there is clarity in what the government

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.110
-- in the measures the government is taking?

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.100
DAVID WESSEL: I think it'll help a lot to
get clarity.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:58.620
It's been very confusing. Some of the advice
from the White House podium has been confusing,

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.460
all this back and forth between the House
and the Senate. So I think, as soon as we

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.080
get some clear idea of what's going to be
in this big bill, this trillion-dollar stimulus,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.740
people will begin to see, what's it going
to mean to me? What are they going to do?

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.720
But I think a second important thing is, I
hope that they build into this bill a kind

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.380
-- a trigger, so that, if this is prolonged,
the aid will automatically be extended.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.630
One of the things we learned during the Great
Recession is, if you're not pessimistic enough,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.820
and the stimulus stops, then the economy takes
a hit. So, we want this one to be automatic.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.460
If unemployment rises and stays high, we might
have more checks to people or more loans to

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.460
business.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.710
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it is it possible, finally,
David, to be able to say how much it's going

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.010
to take to reassure folks?

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.010
(CROSSTALK)

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.010
DAVID WESSEL: I don't think it is possible.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.460
I can't tell you how long this is going to
go on, how long I'm going to be -- have to

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.860
be working at home. And that's true for everybody.
So I think that the government needs to do

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:02.920
things now both to alleviate the pain and
to put some money in the system, so that,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.660
when the pandemic does recede, as it is apparently
doing in China, the economy can get restarted

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.660
again.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:15.460
But uncertainty is really hard for people
to adjust to. And when people tell you, oh,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.860
this is going to be over by the summer, I
think we have all learned that those people

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.850
don't know what they're talking about. So
it's not very comforting.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.150
JUDY WOODRUFF: One-point-three-trillion, and
I hear you saying it could be bigger, bigger

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.150
and bigger.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.150
DAVID WESSEL: Absolutely.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:33.480
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Wessel, thank you very
much.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:41.890
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:52.950
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new analysis by researchers
at Harvard University shows that the bed capacity

00:21:52.950 --> 00:22:00.060
of hospitals in many parts of the U.S. will
be overwhelmed if the COVID-19 coronavirus

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.810
continues to spread across the country.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:06.860
And, as Amna Nawaz reports, hospitals and
health care systems are working to increase

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.860
their readiness.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:13.350
AMNA NAWAZ: Judy, the Harvard study indicates
that, when spread over a 12-month period,

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:18.060
even a moderate number of coronavirus cases
will begin to fill some American hospitals

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:22.120
to capacity, unless they free up already occupied
beds.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.130
The faster the pace of infection, and the
larger the numbers grow, the greater the shortfalls

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.130
become.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:32.080
For what hospitals are doing to prepare themselves
and what more needs to be done, I'm joined

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.520
by two people who focus closely on preparedness.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.060
Jeremy Konyndyk is a senior policy fellow
at the Center for Global Development whose

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:44.710
research focuses on global outbreak preparedness,
among other things. He joins us by Skype.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:50.020
And here in the studio, Dr. Bruce Siegel.
He's the president and CEO of America's Essential

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.740
Hospitals. That's an association of more than
300 hospitals and health care systems.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.870
And welcome to you both.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.400
Dr. Siegel, I want to start with you here.
We know there will be a surge of patients.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.430
We know that's coming.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.501
You told my colleague earlier, our hospitals
are moving quickly to prepare for that. What

00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:08.290
specifically are they doing right now? And
are you confident they will be ready?

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.110
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL, President and CEO, America's
Essential Hospitals: So, the good news is

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:14.640
that millions of health professionals in our
hospitals are working hard to prepare.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.740
They are clearing out some of the elective
surgery cases, things that don't have to be

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.580
done right now, to get that space ready for
a surge in patients.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.810
They are expanding their capacity, you know,
bringing beds and floors back into use that

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:34.680
were maybe not used, building tents for triage
centers and testing in their parking lots

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.920
to keep sick patients away from the rest of
their patient population. There's a lot going

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920
on.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.920
AMNA NAWAZ: How confident are you they are
going to be ready to meet with the expected

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920
surge?

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.780
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: I think that they will do
a good job of meeting that surge.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.980
I think they will do a good job of meeting
that surge. I think if we, as citizens, also

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.540
try to make sure that surge as small as possible
by distancing ourselves from each other, as

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.670
we're doing right now, that will help a huge
amount.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:01.010
My concern will be, will they have the resources
for a sustained response? And that's going

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.660
to be something that Congress is going to
have to really think hard about and act on

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.700
in the days ahead.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.470
AMNA NAWAZ: Jeremy Konyndyk, let me ask you
about this.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:13.040
Some people will look at the maps on this.
And it's very alarming when you see how much

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.650
of the country and how many of our hospitals
could become overwhelmed. Those darker red

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:23.190
portions, by the way, represent over 1000
percent capacity for some of those hospitals.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.309
And that's in a moderate scenario.

00:24:25.309 --> 00:24:28.360
Tell me how you're looking at this. Do you
believe the health care system and the hospitals

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.020
can get to the capacity they need to handle
even a moderate surge?

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.390
JEREMY KONYNDYK, Former USAID Official: I
think it's going to be an enormous struggle.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.820
And it's complicated by the fact that we have
already lost quite a bit of time. We should

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.850
have begun the process of this as soon as
we saw what was happening in Wuhan, China,

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:50.370
in mid-January, the way that hospitals and
modern hospitals there were overwhelmed very

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.560
rapidly by this virus.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.450
We're going to face struggles with PPE. We're
going to face struggles with health care workers

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:03.340
becoming infected. We have lost a lot of time.
I think there are measures that we can begin

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.970
to take. Some of the things that the president
announced today are positive.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.070
It would have been better if they'd been announced
a month ago. So we're just kind of in catchup

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.070
mode still.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.290
AMNA NAWAZ: What did you hear today that was
positive?

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.309
JEREMY KONYNDYK: Well, I think the Defense
Production Act, I think the moving of the

00:25:16.309 --> 00:25:20.720
hospital ships, all of those things help somewhat
to relieve the pressure.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.990
But they're also -- it's going to take a while.
We learned after the announcement that one

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:29.000
of the hospital ships won't be ready to leave
port for a few more weeks. Obviously, Defense

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.240
Production Act work, if you start telling
a company now to start manufacturing ventilators

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.400
or N95 masks, that's not going to show up
in the supply chain for weeks or months.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.490
AMNA NAWAZ: Dr. Siegel, the PPE that Jeremy
mentioned -- that is personal protective equipment

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.730
-- that is what your front-line health care
workers need...

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.730
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: Absolutely.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.370
AMNA NAWAZ: ... to be able to protect themselves
when they're handling those patients.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.370
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: Yes.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.840
AMNA NAWAZ: Are you close to having what you
need? And how dependent are you on the federal

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.100
government to get that supply?

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.250
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: So, we are not close to
having what we need.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.450
We're already seeing some spot shortages in
some areas. And that could get worse, a lot

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.740
worse, as the surge materializes. We are very
dependent on the federal government for making

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.740
this happen.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.480
And I'm glad that there are things happening
now to start to get manufacturing up and to

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.590
sort of divert resources to this sector. But
my biggest concern is that we have stressed

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:19.760
safety net hospitals in this country, stressed
rural hospitals with maybe a week of cash

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.270
on hand.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:26.650
As they lose their paying business, as they
see a spike in uninsured patients coming in,

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.910
as they have to spend millions and millions
on treating sick coronavirus patients, they're

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.020
going to run out of resources. They will literally
could run out of money.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:39.950
And we're going to need Congress to make sure
that we have that backstop to be there for

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.210
these communities, given how sobering this
is going to be.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.040
AMNA NAWAZ: The other thing people hear a
lot about are ventilators and the need for

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.390
critical care in severe cases. Do you have
the ventilators you need? Are you confident

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.870
you will get the supply that you need?

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.730
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: We are -- we are working
as hard as we can to make it happen. We need

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.550
the government to step in. Are we sure we
will have what we need? No, we're not. Let's

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.860
be very clear about that.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:05.170
And I'm glad that we're preparing and moving
all the things we need to in place, like the

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:09.440
hospital ship. So, that's going to take longer
than we expected. But we still have a long

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.690
ways to go. And the decisions we make in the
next few days around resources, around the

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:19.760
stimulus bill are going to be absolutely critical,
so we can really do this for the long haul,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.680
because this may go on longer than some of
us would ever, ever like.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.650
AMNA NAWAZ: Jeremy, you mentioned that Defense
Production Act the president put into place

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.770
today.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.790
To what degree do you think that will fill
this gap Dr. Siegel is saying that we know

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:37.410
we have right now? And what other levers of
the federal government could we be pulling

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.830
and using right now, if needed?

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.250
JEREMY KONYNDYK: Yes.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:46.790
I think the Defense Production Act will -- it
basically forces companies to manufacture

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.260
certain things. I think the companies would
probably be inclined to manufacture those

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.590
things anyway, if it keeps the factories running
and if there's money behind it.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:57.570
So I think it's a helpful tool. It probably
isn't a total game-changer.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.200
One of the things I'm still hearing about
from a lot of the doctors I talk to in New

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.400
York City and in Northern California is lack
of testing. They are still struggling to get

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.001
the testing that they need, both for their
patients, but also for themselves. If they

00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:14.420
are exposed, it's quite important they be
able to get a test quickly to determine whether

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.809
they're infected or not, because, if they're
infected, they have to go into quarantine.

00:28:17.809 --> 00:28:21.140
If they're not, they can stay at work. Right
now, if you can't tell, you have to take the

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.820
precaution, and you lose them from the work
force.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.090
AMNA NAWAZ: Jeremy, when you see the president
speaking now, you see a number of different

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.131
officials from different agencies working
together and working behind him.

00:28:29.131 --> 00:28:33.690
Are you confident that every single element,
every single resource at the government's

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.330
disposal, is being used right now? Or are
there other steps they could be taking right

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.330
now?

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:43.510
JEREMY KONYNDYK: I'm not confident. And I
think that that -- I think they have made

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.380
some headway, but they're still not where
they need to be.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.780
We were in a sort of inactive mode for about
the first month-and-a-half of this, where

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.300
we were really not moving out in an expeditious
way on preparing the homeland for the arrival

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.510
of this virus. I think we have now moved into
reactive mode, but we're still not in proactive

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.510
mode.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.970
So, yes, they're starting to get some things
in motion, but they're still playing catchup.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.310
And I think it's hard to have confidence in
the overall management of this, given what

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.170
we have seen so far. But I hope it will...

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.520
AMNA NAWAZ: Dr. Siegel, when we see some of
the projections, obviously, as Jeremy said,

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.520
there's a lot we don't know.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.520
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: Right.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.850
AMNA NAWAZ: We don't know how long it will
take. We don't know when the surges will happen,

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.780
when those viruses will peak.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.590
How do hospitals prepare for this? Do they
go for the worst-case scenario? Or do they

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.610
hope for a mild outbreak?

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.370
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: Oh, you have to think about
the worst-case scenario.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:34.240
So our hospitals are really thinking about,
how bad could this get, and realizing that

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.870
make a bed in one community now, and maybe
it'll get worse in another community some

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:43.690
weeks later. But they have to be prepared
for the worst, or at least do their best to

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.300
get to that point.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:52.230
We can't be optimistic or -- hope is not a
policy here. We have got to really -- and

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:58.610
I'm confident they are -- our hospital leaders
and nurses and doctors prepare for how bad

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.401
this could be, even though we hope to avoid
it by doing the things we're trying to do

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:03.401
right now.

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.110
AMNA NAWAZ: We all hope those plans will come
together.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.140
Dr. Bruce Siegel and Jeremy Konyndyk, thank
you very much for your time.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.140
DR. BRUCE SIEGEL: Thank you.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.470
JEREMY KONYNDYK: Pleasure.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:16.210
JUDY WOODRUFF: And please join us tomorrow,
when we are hosting a virtual town hall, "Confronting

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:23.270
Coronavirus," at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 7:00 Central,
on all PBS stations and streaming on the PBS

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:28.559
app and on the "PBS NewsHour" social channels,
including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:32.740
Please watch to hear some of your questions
answered by people who are on the front lines

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:45.170
of the crisis.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:50.021
In the day's other news: Alabama postponed
a Republican primary runoff for a U.S. Senate

00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:52.640
seat because of the coronavirus.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:58.850
It is being delayed until July 14. The race
pits former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:03.929
against Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn
University football coach. The winner faces

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:07.340
Democratic Senator Doug Jones, the incumbent
in November

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:14.520
A diplomatic feud between China and the U.S.
escalated today. Beijing defended its expulsion

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:20.160
of 13 journalists with The New York Times,
The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:26.000
It cited tighter controls on Chinese state-run
media organizations in the U.S.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.930
But President Trump denounced the Chinese
response.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.530
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:
Yes, I'm not happy to see it. I don't -- you

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:38.941
know, I have my own disputes with all three
of those media groups. I think you know that

00:31:38.941 --> 00:31:43.881
very well. But I don't like seeing that at
all. I'm not happy about that at all.

00:31:43.881 --> 00:31:48.650
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time, U.S. officials
accused China today of hiding information

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.290
on the initial outbreak of the coronavirus.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:56.820
Back in this country, an earthquake rocked
several million people around Salt Lake City,

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:02.390
Utah, this morning. There were no major injuries,
but the tremor and the aftershocks damaged

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:09.470
some buildings and knocked out power to thousands.
The city's airport also shut down for a time.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:16.360
And the famed Alaskan sled dog race, the Iditarod,
finished today. Thomas Waerner of Norway crossed

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:23.400
the finish line in Nominee just after midnight,
beating his closest competitor by five hours.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.380
Small crowds turned out, despite coronavirus
concerns.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.520
Congratulations to him.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.580
Still to come on the "NewsHour": on the ground
in Iran, where state officials warn that millions

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:42.280
of people could die in the pandemic; plus,
celebrated cellist Yo-Yo Ma on songs of comfort

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:57.000
in a time

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.440
of crisis.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:08.520
One of the countries hardest hit by COVID-19
is Iran. Thousands there have the virus, and

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.980
the death toll is skyrocketing, amid preparations
for a subdued Iranian new year.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.710
The conflict with the United States is now
never far from mind there.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:24.620
As special correspondent Reza Sayah reports
from Tehran, coronavirus and that confrontation

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.720
make for a volatile mix.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:34.480
REZA SAYAH: Once a year in the streets of
Tehran, Hajji Firuz welcomes to the first

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:40.980
day of spring and Nowruz, the Iranian new
year. Like Santa Claus, this soot-covered

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:47.380
fictional character's job is to spread holiday
joy, but, this year, he's not seeing many

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.380
smiles.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.940
MAN (through translator): It's the worst new
year ever. I have played for Hajji Firuz for

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:56.820
20 years. This is the first time I have seen
it like this. They're not in a good mood.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:02.710
REZA SAYAH: A good mood is hard to find in
Iran these days. The coronavirus outbreak

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:09.300
is exploding. The daily death toll is hitting
triple digits, more than 17,000 Iranians have

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.040
tested positive.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.640
Mahmoud Sadeghi is among more than three dozen
public officials who caught the virus. The

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.010
lawmaker recovered last week. He spoke to
us by video chat.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.470
MAHMOUD SADEGHI, Iranian Parliament Member
(through translator): I had totally surrendered

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:27.730
to my destiny. I even started writing my will.
I almost finished.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:33.000
REZA SAYAH: Sadeghi says he's heating the
government's call to stay home. Many Iranians

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.720
are doing the same. Tehran's streets, usually
bustling with new year traffic, are nearly

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.090
empty. With the coronavirus, a lot has changed.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:48.210
But here's what hasn't changed. At a time
when the U.N. is calling for global cooperation

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:54.870
to fight the coronavirus, Tehran and Washington
are still in conflict, still damning one another,

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.680
and, some say, edging closer to war.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.650
Last Wednesday marked the birthday of Qasem
Soleimani, the Iranian general assassinated

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:10.450
in January in a U.S. drone strike. On Soleimani's
birthday, a rocket attack hit a military base

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:16.440
in Iraq, killing two American soldiers. One
day later, the Pentagon launched airstrikes

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.619
targeting Iranian-backed Shia militias, saying
they were responsible.

00:35:20.619 --> 00:35:22.080
MOHAMMAD HASHEMI, Political Commentator: Things
are getting worse.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.230
REZA SAYAH: Tehran-based political commentator
Mohammad Hashemi says, at a time when both

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:32.830
countries should be focusing on containing
a pandemic, war seems closer than ever.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.400
MOHAMMAD HASHEMI: This was the worst time
for such things happen, because everybody

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.690
fear of another war in the region.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:45.490
And then, in the middle of the crisis, that
Iran is trying to deal with this coronavirus

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.490
outbreak.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:52.180
REZA SAYAH: Tehran and Washington are feuding
over the coronavirus too. Yesterday, Secretary

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:56.660
of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of covering
up the outbreak.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.400
MIKE POMPEO, U.S. Secretary of State: Instead
of focusing on the needs of the Iranian people

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:05.260
and accepting genuine offers of support, senior
Iranian lied about Wuhan virus outbreak four

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.260
weeks.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:11.060
REZA SAYAH: Last week, The Washington Post
cited satellite images to report authorities

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:16.619
in Iran raced to dig trenches at a cemetery
in the city of Qom in an effort to hide the

00:36:16.619 --> 00:36:22.490
death toll. The site was so vast, The Post
said, it was visible from space.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.920
Other news organizations picked up the story,
some calling the site a mass grave.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.430
HABIB ABDOLHOSSEIN, Press TV: Well, I was
shocked and terrified.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:36.640
REZA SAYAH: Habib Abdolhossein is a reporter
at Press TV, Iran's state-funded English language

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:42.810
news network. He says the site was no secret
and prepared to accommodate the Islamic custom

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.619
of burying loved ones within 24 hours.

00:36:45.619 --> 00:36:50.940
HABIB ABDOLHOSSEIN: Satellite images cannot
prove that a mass grave exist somewhere or

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.940
not.

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:56.080
REZA SAYAH: Do you understand that some of
the critics of the Islamic Republic of Iran

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:02.250
say that Press TV is the state's news network,
and they don't cover it objectively?

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.250
HABIB ABDOLHOSSEIN: Of course.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.250
REZA SAYAH: You do?

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.680
HABIB ABDOLHOSSEIN: Of course. Yes, of course.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.900
I cannot deny that there have been mismanagement.
Definitely, there have been mismanagement,

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.530
dysfunction in Iran and other countries. But
this is something that happens, either in

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:22.830
Iran or in Italy. This is not fair. They're
just trying to blame Iran and pile up pressure

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:23.830
on Iran.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:29.220
REZA SAYAH: This report written by a local
reporter in Qom three weeks prior to The Washington

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:35.880
Post report announced preparation of roughly
100 graves at the same cemetery for victims

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.650
of the virus, suggesting the site wasn't a
secret.

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:45.461
Numerous pictures posted on social media and
the cemetery Web site also show the site was

00:37:45.461 --> 00:37:49.960
prepared just as other graves are prepared
in Iran.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.680
Perhaps no voice in Iran is more objective
when it comes to the coronavirus than the

00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:00.119
World Health Organization. They neither represent
the Iranian government nor U.S. interests.

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:04.500
They're working to contain the virus. And
they granted us an interview.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:10.109
The sign says no entry without wearing a mask.
So we're going to put on a mask. There have

00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:14.140
been critics of the Iranian government who
say they haven't done enough, they reacted

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.760
too slow. What is your response to those allegations?

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.930
CHRISTOPH HAMELMANN, World Health Organization:
You know, two weeks ago, the response was

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:27.090
a bit more difficult, because there were only
two or three countries which had self-sustained

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:32.740
epidemic. So, there was a lot of focus on
what do they do different or maybe wrong or

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.510
not to that scale as others?

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.520
That kind of debate has vanished to a largest
degree.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.430
REZA SAYAH: Are you satisfied with the response
here?

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:48.190
CHRISTOPH HAMELMANN: I'm very satisfied with
the response, in terms of the planning. The

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:52.560
national plan has really all the components
we are recommending a national plan should

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.560
have.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:59.500
REZA SAYAH: Here, on the eve of every last
Wednesday before the new year, Iranians hold

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:07.500
a Festival of Fire. They cast aside bad luck
and look forward to happier days.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:13.450
With the coronavirus, many celebrated from
inside their homes. For them, happier days

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:18.210
will come if Tehran and Washington can ever
set aside their differences.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.200
SAGHAR SAHADJAMI, Physician (through translator):
This is not the time for politics to be injected

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.000
into the daily challenges of people.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.490
REZA SAYAH: And share in the fight against
a growing pandemic.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:36.100
For the "PBS NewsHour." I'm Reza Sayah in
Tehran.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:50.580
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Congress weighs relief packages
meant to blunt COVID-19's impact on the U.S.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:55.910
economy, lawmakers are also dealing with new
problems the virus is creating in their home

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:56.910
states.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:03.210
Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana,
is one of them. His state has at least 250

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:09.090
confirmed cases of the coronavirus. And, so
far, seven people have died. He is also one

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.540
of three medical doctors currently serving
in the Senate.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.810
And he joins us now from Capitol Hill.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:18.200
Senator Cassidy, thank you so much for being
with us.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:24.201
So, the legislation the Senate passed today
providing free testing, paid sick leave, help

00:40:24.201 --> 00:40:29.030
for some of the poorest Americans, how much
do you think this is going to alleviate the

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.740
hit many Americans are going to be taking
now?

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.210
SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I'm not sure.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:38.590
The goal is to alleviate it as much as possible.
But this is only the second of at least three

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.230
packages. If there's something that we can
do that has not been done in the first two

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:43.640
packages, we shall do it.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.410
I mean, the American people need to know that
Congress is there with them. And, as much

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.160
as we can, we're going to get our nation through
this rough patch.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:56.291
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know there's a second
package being worked on, $1.3 trillion. It

00:40:56.291 --> 00:41:00.869
would include direct cash payments, among
other things.

00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:06.610
How confident do you think Americans can be
that these pieces of legislation are going

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.280
to help people who are most in need?

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.610
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: They're going to pass.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.860
And if you're speaking about a direct payment,
when I speak to a family, they're concerned

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:18.020
about their mortgage, their car note, how
are they going to buy groceries, particularly

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.720
an issue for the lower income, less likely
to have savings. That's where the money will

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.720
be targeted.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.550
Mnuchin says we can have it out by the end
of the first week in April. Well, oftentimes,

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:31.680
mortgage payments are oftentimes due the first
week in April. So, hopefully, we will get

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680
help there.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.010
But we're also trying to do other things that
help businesses that employ people through

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:37.430
this rough patch.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:41.010
And so, if you come back and you don't have
a job, that's not good. So we're trying to

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:45.500
help that small business, so that she can
stay in business and that she can keep her

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.130
employees as employees.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.600
So, on all levels, we're trying to address
this.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.710
JUDY WOODRUFF: The American people are so
used to looking at Washington, looking at

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.840
dysfunction, frankly, looking at the two political
parties fighting with each other, rather than

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.520
working together.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:05.240
What are we going to see right now? Is this
going to be an example of the two parties

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.070
actually working together for a change?

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.420
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: We are in this together.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.320
And let me speak on another divide. Sometimes,
there's a divide between what people who are

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.810
not in Washington think and what people in
Washington think.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:22.349
I can tell you now, speaking as a doctor,
if somebody at home decides to self-quarantine,

00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:26.640
maybe they have symptoms, maybe not, they
don't expose six other people potentially

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.390
to coronavirus, they have had more of an impact
on stopping the spread of the disease than

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:36.120
all the doctors and nurses in your community,
because we don't have an effective treatment.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.190
The best way to treat is not get infected.
So I would say, not only will there be unity

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:44.290
between Republicans and Democrats, but there
will be unity between people in Washington

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:49.340
and folks who are at home who sent us to Washington.
We have to have common cause if we are going

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.540
to defeat this disease.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:56.620
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Cassidy, as a physician,
you obviously know a lot about what's going

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.690
on here.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:02.930
How worried are you about what lies ahead?
And do you think the American people now have

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.640
the full picture of what's coming?

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.880
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: I think the American people
are grasping it.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.470
And it seems a little surreal, but it is coming
home when you see that my state of Louisiana

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:20.280
now has 257 confirmed cases and seven deaths.
Nine days ago, we had one case. Now we have

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.369
257. It is spreading.

00:43:23.369 --> 00:43:31.160
So I think that's coming home. I'm very worried.
This has the potential to follow the track

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.359
of what has happened in Italy, where there
is a rapid increase in the number of cases,

00:43:35.359 --> 00:43:38.320
and the hospital system becomes overwhelmed.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.619
I will say, I'm working closely with the White
House, closely with my governor, all levels

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:45.619
of government, to see what we can do to expand
capacity.

00:43:45.619 --> 00:43:50.730
But, ultimately, Judy, if somebody doesn't
go out, does not infect another, that has

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:57.050
tremendous impact upon whether that other
person will live, flatten the curve, if you

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.050
will.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:03.310
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you about public
health facilities, the ability of the health

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:10.000
care facilities in your state of Louisiana
to handle what's coming in terms of hospital

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.990
beds, in terms of ventilators, whatever else
is going to be needed.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:18.210
Is there the capacity now to deal with what's
coming in Louisiana?

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:23.570
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: If it happens as it happened
in Italy, nobody is going to have the capacity,

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.940
where you just had an exponential rise in
the number of cases.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:30.830
If we're able to flatten the curve, and people
accept the disruption in their lives for the

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:35.640
next few weeks or maybe a month or so, then
we can flatten the curve, and we will have

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640
capability.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.880
So, I think it really depends upon what we
do as a nation. If we stay at home, care for

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.270
others people, if we have symptoms or not,
just stay at home, don't expose others, we

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.920
will have capacity. If not, we will be overwhelmed.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:56.440
JUDY WOODRUFF: We saw today, Senator, the
president issuing an executive order having

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:01.940
to do with prioritizing allocating health
and medical resources.

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.990
How much of a difference is that going to
make?

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.970
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: It's going to make a huge
difference.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:10.590
Right now, I'm continuing to hear folks that
back home cannot get viral transport medium

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:15.890
to take their swab that someone's taken for
the virus to actually get tested. Masks are

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:20.130
in short supply, personal protective equipment.
I could go down the list.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:24.859
But we need those things. We need them rapidly.
Ventilators are being purchased, but I'm sure

00:45:24.859 --> 00:45:28.820
there's going to be a backorder for that sooner
or later. Go down the list of what's needed,

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.820
we need more of it.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:35.650
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when it comes to prioritizing,
how do you look at that as a question facing

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:36.750
the health care profession?

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.150
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: We have to get more testing.
We have to protect medical providers.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:45.850
Medical providers are a limited capacity.
We can't open up an old hospital and create

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:49.610
more beds if you don't have the nurses and
the doctors and the techs and everyone else

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:50.770
it takes to run those.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:55.340
So, we have to protect our medical professionals.
It's so gratifying. My professional -- my

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.940
colleagues are front-line. They want to be
front-line. But we have got to keep them healthy,

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.070
because, if they're not healthy, they can't
take care of patients. We need them taking

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.160
care of patients.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.681
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, Senator, President
Trump has called this the Chinese virus. You're

00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.560
not using that term. Why not?

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.460
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: This is something which
happens regularly, where a virus moves from

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.910
one animal into human beings.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:21.590
The Chinese physicians have been outstanding
in sharing medical information with the rest

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:26.510
of the world. And I was, just before you got
on, reading several "New England Journal of

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:30.869
Medicine" articles published by Chinese about
whether this medical therapy works, what's

00:46:30.869 --> 00:46:31.869
the impact of children.

00:46:31.869 --> 00:46:38.160
I could go on. Speaking now as a physician,
the international collegiality among health

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.930
care workers has been fantastic. And just
as we need Washington to work well with the

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:49.050
parties and with people who are not in Washington,
our medical community has to work well internationally,

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:53.130
because this is an international issue. We
are truly in it together.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.550
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana,
we thank you very much.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.609
SEN. BILL CASSIDY: Thank you, Judy.

00:46:57.609 --> 00:47:14.290
JUDY WOODRUFF: At a time of national and,
indeed, global trauma, a leading artist offers

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.380
us songs of comfort.

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.770
Jeffrey Brown has that for our ongoing arts
and culture series, Canvas.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:25.841
JEFFREY BROWN: He is one of the world's most
renowned and beloved musicians, and now he

00:47:25.841 --> 00:47:28.940
is reaching out in a new way in this current
crisis.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:34.770
Cellist Yo-Yo Ma recently began posting videos
of himself performing short pieces and songs

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.470
that can speak to those most in need and to
all of us.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:42.360
Yo-Yo Ma joins me from his home in Massachusetts
by Skype.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.910
And, Yo-Yo, it's nice to talk to you. Here
we are. You are stuck at home like most of

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:51.599
us, but you're still playing. Tell us about
this idea that you have, the project called

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:52.700
Songs of Comfort.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:58.230
Yo-YO MA, Cellist: Well, this idea came by
pretty much spontaneously.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:04.550
I was in the office one day, and we were talking
and said, you know, let's do something, because

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:11.930
let's do something in this time that actually
serves people's needs.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:18.710
And we thought that, somehow, music always
has been comforting to me, this is what I

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:24.089
do, and this is the best that I can offer.
And I know many people are doing everything

00:48:24.089 --> 00:48:28.690
they can from what they know. And this is
just something that I can do.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.510
JEFFREY BROWN: This is what you do.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:35.560
I mean, in what sense -- what's your sense
of what music or art can do? I mean, we talk

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.670
about this all the time. People have real
needs. We have just had a whole program talking

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:45.830
about hospitals and medical needs and food
and money, of course. What can music and art

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.830
do?

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.200
YO-YO MA: Well, I can tell you one thing.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:55.040
When I was 19, I had a teacher who said, Yo-Yo,
you haven't found your voice.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:04.859
And I said, OK. And so I kept looking for
my voice. And I think my voice is in finding

00:49:04.859 --> 00:49:13.650
the needs of others and then representing
them. And that's -- and so, everywhere I go,

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:21.839
it's always about finding what people are
thinking, feeling, how they think about themselves

00:49:21.839 --> 00:49:23.990
in the world.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:29.410
And if I can find something that they need,
and if I can actually offer a little bit of

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:34.530
something that is comforting, then that's
how I would define my job.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:40.240
JEFFREY BROWN: So here you are now playing
and posting pieces, but it's more than that,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.770
right? You want others to join in, to send
in their own songs, and it doesn't even have

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:46.770
to be music.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:49.330
Tell us about what you're hoping will happen.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:54.430
YO-YO MA: Well, you know, what's amazing is
that what's already happened is that, since

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:59.121
just a couple of days ago, there are people
who have posted from the Mayo Clinic. Two

00:49:59.121 --> 00:50:02.030
doctors have actually sung something.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:08.430
The lead singer from a rock band, Mashrou'
Leila in Lebanon, actually put in a song.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:15.230
And two women from Ireland and Germany sang
something on in sync, on -- in troubled times.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:22.940
And so the idea is music is for everyone.
It's not the practitioners doing music, but

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:30.070
it's something that does something for us.
Now, a virus is something that travels globally.

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:34.890
It knows no borders, no walls, no boundaries.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:42.560
And music is something that actually looks
into the inside, and that also knows know

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:50.060
boundaries. And if we can actually express
what is on our insides and show that, then

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:55.310
this is the beginning of a deeper understanding
of one another.

00:50:55.310 --> 00:51:02.100
JEFFREY BROWN: We want to join you, your organization.
We at the "NewsHour" want to join and encourage

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:12.390
people to send in their own videos to #SongsofComfort,
post them on Twitter, or Instagram, Facebook,

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:13.390
wherever.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:17.280
And then what are we collecting? What are
you hoping that we get?

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:30.020
YO-YO MA: We're collecting what is personal,
what is true, what is trustworthy, what is

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:37.890
community, because community is nothing, except
what is based on trust.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:44.550
And when you say something in music, it better
be true, because, otherwise, it doesn't communicate.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.349
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so we're going to
do this together.

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:53.220
And I want to tell our audience, please post
some videos, and we here at the "NewsHour,"

00:51:53.220 --> 00:52:00.150
we're going to post -- update this project
as we can on digital and broadcast, Canvas,

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:03.820
for our arts coverage as well, joining Yo-Yo
Ma in this.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:08.820
And I want to say thank you to you for doing
this. And it's a pleasure to be part of it

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.820
with you.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:21.240
And, before we go, Yo-Yo Ma plays Dvorak for
us.

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:29.590
(MUSIC)

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:54.640
JEFFREY BROWN: #SongsofComfort.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:53:44.740
Yo-Yo Ma, thank you very much.

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.619
YO-YO MA: Thank you so much, Jeffrey.

00:53:47.619 --> 00:53:50.130
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Yo-Yo Ma.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:53.330
I can't imagine anything more welcome at a
time like this.

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:58.640
And, as Jeff pointed out, we hope that, if
you have art to share, you will join us. Upload

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:04.119
your videos to Twitter, to Instagram or Facebook
using the hashtag #SongsofComfort.

00:54:04.119 --> 00:54:13.180
We will be watching, and we may use them in
the future on air and online at PBS.org/NewsHour.

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.000
And that is the "NewsHour" for tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Join us online and again here tomorrow evening.
For all of us at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

00:54:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
you, stay safe, and we'll see you soon.
