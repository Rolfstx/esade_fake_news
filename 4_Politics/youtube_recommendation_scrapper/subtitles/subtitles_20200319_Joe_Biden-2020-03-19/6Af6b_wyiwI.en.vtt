00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.398
 when I was a kid, 

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:22.959
 The disaster we were concerned about was nuclear war. 

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:27.085
 That's why we had such a barrel in the basement, 

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:29.656
 Filled with food and water cans. 

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:31.901
 When a nuclear attack occurs, 

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:36.637
 Presumably taking shelter in the basement, eating from the contents of the barrel. 

00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:41.597
 Today the greatest global catastrophe 

00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:44.457
 It doesn't look like this. 

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:47.238
 Rather, it looks like this. 

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:53.929
 If anything will kill more than 10 million people in the next few decades, 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.314
 It is likely to be a highly contagious virus 

00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:59.792
 It is not war. 

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:03.679
 Not rockets, but microbes. 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.878
 Part of the reason behind this is 

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:10.081
 Our investment of huge sums for nuclear deterrence 

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:15.179
 But in reality we are investing very little in stopping epidemics. 

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:19.093
 We are not ready for the next epidemic. 

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:21.758
 Let's look at Ebola. 

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:25.615
 I'm sure each of you saw it in the newspapers, 

00:01:25.615 --> 00:01:27.221
 Many challenging challenges. 

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:30.876
 I carefully tracked it through the analysis tools 

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:35.721
 Used to monitor polio eradication. 

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.573
 As you have seen in the past, 

00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:42.081
 The problem was that the system was not working well enough, 

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.649
 Rather, there is no system at all. 

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:51.028
 In fact, there were some key pieces missing. 

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:55.940
 We had no group of epidemiologists ready to go 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.696
 To see what the disease was, look at how quickly it has spread. 

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:02.452
 The status reports came on paper. 

00:02:02.452 --> 00:02:04.808
 It is too late before being put online 

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:06.782
 It was not very accurate. 

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:09.858
 We had no medical team ready to go. 

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:12.453
 We had no way to prepare people. 

00:02:12.453 --> 00:02:17.784
 MSF has done a great job of organizing volunteers. 

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:20.880
 However, we are still far from what should have been 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.022
 It is to get thousands of workers in these countries. 

00:02:24.022 --> 00:02:31.007
 A great pandemic may require that we have hundreds of thousands of workers. 

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:37.155
 No one was looking for a cure. 

00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:38.946
 Nobody to look at the diagnosis. 

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:42.243
 Nobody will know which tool should be used. 

00:02:42.243 --> 00:02:45.723
 For example, we could have taken blood from survivors, 

00:02:45.723 --> 00:02:51.158
 Treat it, and put this plasma back in people to protect them. 

00:02:51.158 --> 00:02:53.764
 But this was never tried. 

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:55.830
 So there were a lot of things missing. 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.415
 This was a true global failure 

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:05.873
 The Health Organization was established to monitor epidemics, not to do the things that I talked about. 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.842
 However, in movies it looks very different. 

00:03:09.842 --> 00:03:14.674
 There is a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, 

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:20.446
 They move, they save people, but it's just a representation. 

00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:25.887
 Failure to prepare may allow the next epidemic 

00:03:25.887 --> 00:03:29.695
 To be more destructive than Ebola 

00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:35.531
 Let's look at the evolution of Ebola during this year. 

00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:39.149
 Killed about 10,000 people, 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.846
 Most of them belonged to the three countries in West Africa. 

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:46.433
 There are three reasons why the epidemic may not spread further. 

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:50.874
 The first reason is due to the heroic work done by health workers. 

00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:54.136
 They treat people and prevent more cases. 

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:56.621
 The second is the nature of the virus. 

00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.697
 Ebola does not spread through the air. 

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:01.810
 When the disease reaches the stage of infection, 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.550
 Most of the infected people are in bed. 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.411
 Third, the epidemic has not entered many urban areas. 

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:12.115
 That was just luck. 

00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:14.355
 If he entered urban areas, 

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:17.877
 The numbers would have been much greater. 

00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:21.466
 So next time, we may not be very lucky. 

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:26.530
 An individual can be infected with a contagious virus but feel well able to 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.841
 From riding a plane or going to the market. 

00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:32.846
 The source of the virus can be from natural epidemics such as Ebola, 

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:34.826
 Or it could be biological terrorism. 

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:39.754
 There are things that can make the situation much worse. 

00:04:39.754 --> 00:04:45.475
 In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spreading through the air, 

00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:49.070
 Like the Spanish flu that appeared in 1918. 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.560
 This is what can happen. 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.558
 It can spread all over the world very, very quickly. 

00:04:55.558 --> 00:05:00.683
 And you can see more than 30 million deaths from this epidemic. 

00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:02.496
 So this is a serious problem. 

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.257
 We have to take care of it. 

00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:08.692
 But in fact, we can build a very good response system. 

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:13.836
 We have the advantages of all science and technology that we talked about. 

00:05:13.836 --> 00:05:14.883
 We have cell phones 

00:05:14.883 --> 00:05:18.140
 To obtain information from the public and to communicate it with them. 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.319
 We have satellite maps that enable us to see where and where people are located. 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.627
 We have this progress in biology 

00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:28.453
 Which should make a tremendous change in the time needed to deal with the virus 

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:33.602
 We will be able to make medicines and vaccines appropriate for this virus. 

00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:35.288
 So we have tools, 

00:05:35.288 --> 00:05:39.500
 But these tools need to be integrated into the global health system. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.793
 And we need to be prepared. 

00:05:41.793 --> 00:05:44.257
 I think the best lessons are how to prepare 

00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:46.758
 It is again, what we do for war. 

00:05:46.758 --> 00:05:51.005
 We have soldiers ready to go at any moment. 

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:54.316
 We have enough reserves for large numbers of people. 

00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:58.005
 NATO has a mobile unit that can be deployed very quickly. 

00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:01.865
 NATO conducts a lot of war games to check if their soldiers are well trained? 

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:03.883
 Do they understand about fuel and logistics 

00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:06.241
 And the same radio frequencies? 

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.779
 So they are always ready to go. 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:13.134
 Those were some of the things we needed to deal with epidemics. 

00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:15.301
 What are the basic pieces? 

00:06:15.301 --> 00:06:20.591
 First, we need strong health systems in poor countries. 

00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:23.778
 Mothers can give birth safely, 

00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:25.295
 And children have access to all vaccines. 

00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:29.634
 He was also able to reveal the beginning of the epidemic early. 

00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:31.935
 We need permanent medical staff 

00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:34.501
 Lots of trained and experienced people 

00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:37.853
 They are ready to take off. 

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:42.266
 We need to accompany this medical staff with the army. 

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:46.417
 In order to take advantage of the army's ability to move quickly and act 

00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:48.220
 And secure the areas. 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.129
 We have to do a simulation, 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.927
 Bacterial games, not war games, so we can see vulnerabilities. 

00:06:55.927 --> 00:06:58.723
 The last time bacterial games were performed in the United States 

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:02.443
 It was 2001, and it wasn't. 

00:07:02.453 --> 00:07:07.490
 So far the result is germs: 1, people: 0. 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.609
 Finally, we need in-depth research into the areas of vaccines and diagnostic methods. 

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:17.246
 There are some great discoveries, such as the associated gland virus, 

00:07:17.246 --> 00:07:21.229
 Which could have spread very quickly. 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:24.599
 Now, I donâ€™t know how much it will cost specifically from a budget, 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.095
 But I'm sure it is very minimal compared to potential damage. 

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:33.740
 The World Bank estimates that if we have a flu pandemic around the world, 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.465
 Then global wealth will decrease by more than three trillion dollars 

00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:41.332
 We will have millions and millions of deaths. 

00:07:41.332 --> 00:07:44.317
 These investments will provide significant benefits 

00:07:44.317 --> 00:07:46.518
 Beyond just being prepared to face the epidemic. 

00:07:46.518 --> 00:07:48.982
 Primary health care, in-depth research, 

00:07:48.982 --> 00:07:51.812
 These things will reduce the disparity in global health 

00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:55.502
 It will make the world more just and also safer. 

00:07:55.502 --> 00:07:58.864
 So I think this should be a priority. 

00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:00.980
 There is no need to panic. 

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.469
 We don't have to hoard spaghetti or take cover in the basement. 

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:09.619
 But we need to act, because time is not on our side. 

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:15.524
 In fact, there is one positive thing that can be learned from the Ebola epidemic, 

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:21.330
 It could be an early warning, or a wake-up call, to prepare. 

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.978
 If we start now, we can be ready for the next pandemic. 

00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:28.574
 Thanks. 

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:31.868
 (clap)
