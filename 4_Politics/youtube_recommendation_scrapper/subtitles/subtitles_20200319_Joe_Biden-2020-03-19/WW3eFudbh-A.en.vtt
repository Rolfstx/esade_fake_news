this is the national effort that the

this is the national effort that the

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:15.550 align:start position:0%
an NHS issue is to increase the number
 

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.710 align:start position:0%
an NHS issue is to increase the number

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:25.169 align:start position:0%

and begin to start looking at what we do
beyond<00:26:58.290><c> that</c><00:26:58.530><c> in</c><00:26:58.740><c> order</c><00:26:59.010><c> to</c><00:26:59.040><c> get</c><00:26:59.250><c> into</c><00:26:59.400><c> the</c>

00:26:59.540 --> 00:26:59.550 align:start position:0%
beyond that in order to get into the
 

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
beyond that in order to get into the
right<00:26:59.700><c> position</c><00:26:59.880><c> and</c><00:27:00.420><c> so</c><00:27:00.780><c> I</c><00:27:00.810><c> think</c><00:27:00.900><c> that's</c>

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.170 align:start position:0%
right position and so I think that's
 

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.570 align:start position:0%
right position and so I think that's
where<00:27:01.410><c> we</c><00:27:01.530><c> need</c><00:27:01.680><c> to</c><00:27:01.710><c> get</c><00:27:01.920><c> to</c><00:27:02.130><c> and</c><00:27:02.310><c> that's</c><00:27:02.370><c> the</c>

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
where we need to get to and that's the
 

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
where we need to get to and that's the
time<00:27:02.790><c> scale</c><00:27:03.120><c> over</c><00:27:03.150><c> which</c><00:27:03.420><c> we</c><00:27:03.720><c> need</c><00:27:03.840><c> to</c><00:27:03.930><c> really</c>
