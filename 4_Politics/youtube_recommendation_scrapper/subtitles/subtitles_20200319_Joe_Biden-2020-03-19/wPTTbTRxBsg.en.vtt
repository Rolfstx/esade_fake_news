AFTER TRUMP MADE A BIG DEAL
ABOUT IT NOT BEING IN WEST

OUT THAT WEST VIRGINIA IS THE

50th STATE TO REPORT A
CORONAVIRUS CASE.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:39.759 align:start position:0%
SO NOW WE'RE ALL IN THIS
TOGETHER.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:46.199
NO RED STATES OR BLUE STATES--
JUST 50 ANXIOUS PALE STATES.

THIS IS A CRISIS THAT WE
HAVE TO FACE TOGETHER...

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:50.303 align:start position:0%
BY STAYING AS FAR APART AS
POSSIBLE.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.371 align:start position:0%

ANNOUNCED THAT BEACH PARTIES

SHOULD BE LIMITED TO GROUPS OF
10 PEOPLE.

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:01.647 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW IT'S SERIOUS WHEN
FLORIDA STARTS ENFORCING RULES.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.086 align:start position:0%
REMEMBER, THEIR STATE
MOTTO IS "CAN YOU HUFF THIS?"

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.823 align:start position:0%
ONE OF THE HOT ZONES IS NEW YORK
CITY, AND YESTERDAY, MAYOR

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:15.795 align:start position:0%
BILL de BLASIO TOLD NEW YORKERS
TO GET READY FOR THE WORST.

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:19.932 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE RIGHT GUIDANCE TO
GIVE ALL NEW YORKERS IS

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.835
EVEN THOUGH A DECISION HAS NOT
BEEN MADE BY THE CITY OR BY THE

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:27.373 align:start position:0%
STATE, I THINK NEW YORKERS
SHOULD BE PREPARED RIGHT NOW FOR

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:30.810 align:start position:0%
THE POSSIBILITY OF A
SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDER.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:34.513
&gt;&gt; Stephen: "SHELTER IN PLACE"
MEANS THAT NO ONE IS ALLOWED OUT

ESSENTIAL TRIPS TO GROCERY

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:39.819 align:start position:0%
STORES AND PHARMACIES.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:44.390

I CAN'T BE WALKING HERE.

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.467 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SHORTLY AFTER THAT,
GOVERNOR CUOMO'S OFFICE

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.868 align:start position:0%
RESPONDED WITH THIS STATEMENT:
"ANY BLANKET QUARANTINE OR

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:58.871 align:start position:0%
SHELTER-IN-PLACE POLICY WOULD
REQUIRE STATE ACTION, AND AS THE

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:02.308
GOVERNOR HAS SAID, THERE IS NO
CONSIDERATION OF THAT FOR ANY

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:03.876 align:start position:0%

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.145 align:start position:0%
MAYOR de BLASIO, GOVERNOR CUOMO,
THE NATION IS IN CRISIS.

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:10.883 align:start position:0%
THIS IS NO TIME FOR A PISSING
MATCH.

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:16.889
YOU SHOULD BE SAVING YOUR URINE
IN JARS, JUST LIKE THE REST OF

00:04:16.922 --> 00:04:19.692 align:start position:0%
US.

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:22.395 align:start position:0%
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
DO THAT, RIGHT?

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:23.596 align:start position:0%
I READ IT ON FACEBOOK.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.697 align:start position:0%
BUT THERE ARE SOME OFFICIALS WHO
AGREE WITH EACH OTHER, LIKE

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.198 size:84% position:42%
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN
NEWSOM, WHO SAID YESTERDAY,

00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:27.833 align:start position:0%
"I DON'T THINK THE SCHOOLS ARE
GOING TO OPEN AGAIN."

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:31.871 align:start position:0%
AND THAT WAS CONFIRMED BY
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION ALICE

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:39.879 size:78% position:39%
COOPER IN HIS STATEMENT:
♪ SCHOOL'S OUT FOR SUMMER

♪ NO MORE TEACHERS, NO MORE--

OH, WE'RE BACK.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.892 size:84% position:42%
DESPITE THE CORONAVIRUS,
YESTERDAY, THERE WERE THREE

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:55.895
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES IN ARIZONA,
ILLINOIS, AND FLORIDA, AND JOE

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.630 align:start position:0%
BIDEN WON ALL THREE.

00:04:57.663 --> 00:05:01.467 align:start position:0%
STRANGELY, NOT THAT BIG A STORY
TODAY.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.470
IT'S LIKE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO
OLD MEN PLAYING "MONOPOLY" WHILE

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:07.873 align:start position:0%
THEIR HOUSE BURNS DOWN.

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:10.910
TECHNICALLY, SOMEBODY WON, BUT
THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE

TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT DAY.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
IT WAS A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED BUTT
KICKING.

00:05:13.512 --> 00:05:15.414 align:start position:0%
BIDEN WON FLORIDA BY ALMOST 40
POINTS.

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:19.185

SNAKES.

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.895
IN ALL, BIDEN HAS NOW WON 19 OF
THE LAST 24 STATE PRIMARIES.

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.664
BUT SINCE WE'VE ALL BEEN BUSY
PAYING ATTENTION TO MORE URGENT

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:33.866 align:start position:0%
MATTERS, YOU MAY HAVE MISSED ALL
THE OTHER THINGS BIDEN HAS

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.369 align:start position:0%

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.721 align:start position:0%
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT
MANGOAT.

00:05:55.754 --> 00:06:02.895 align:start position:0%
I READ ON FACEBOOK THAT THERE'S
A MAN-TO-GOAT TRANSMISSION.

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:04.597 align:start position:0%
NOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
SPECULATION THAT BERNIE

HE'S NOT THE FIRST TO MAKE THIS
TYPING ERROR.

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:32.491 size:81% position:41%

00:06:48.373 --> 00:06:52.812 align:start position:0%

THE NUMBER FOR THAT IS 922.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.710
POLICE SUGGESTED THAT IF YOU DO
RUN OUT OF TOILET PAPER-- AND

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:43.716
THIS IS TRUE-- YOU COULD USE
RECEIPT PAPERS, NEWSPAPERS, OR

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:06.972 align:start position:0%
THOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY, THEY'RE
OVERLOOKING THE CLEAREST

00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:08.841

00:10:28.093 --> 00:10:29.194
HEY, DON'T JUDGE HER UNTIL

IT WAS AN EASY MISTAKE.

AND HAD DRIED OUT," ADDING,
"I AM HOUSESITTING AND HIGH AS

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:44.743
