00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.949 align:start position:0%
quarterback the reason we didn't release
him<00:17:14.010><c> was</c><00:17:14.640><c> because</c><00:17:15.030><c> we</c><00:17:15.179><c> felt</c><00:17:15.449><c> that</c><00:17:15.540><c> we</c><00:17:15.780><c> didn't</c>

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
him was because we felt that we didn't

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
