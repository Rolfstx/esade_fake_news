00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.320
 Ultra-fast computers and advanced mathematical formulas ... 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.120
 have far surpassed humans in stock trading. 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.560
 Some algorithms seem to be alive. 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.040
 Algorithms are quietly waiting for your actions at Apple ... 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.720
 or your pension money is on the market. 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 The only ones who fully understand this system are its architects: 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.640
 algorithm developers. Haim Bodek is one of them. 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.520
 After discovering strange misdeeds, he embarked on a crusade ... 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.280
 against this complex system. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.360
 This goes directly against Wall Street's tacit silence law ... 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.880
 and its confidentiality. Here's what to expect. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 It's like a rule: never accuse others, the market, traders ... 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.440
 it's always your fault, your code is wrong. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.680
 On Wall Street, you are necessarily scammed unless you are the scammer. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.840
 On Wall Street, there is a culture of confidentiality. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.840
 It doesn't happen, going to the SEC. 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.040
 Welcome to Backlight. 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.360
 You will discover the smallest corners of our financial markets. 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.520
 It is played to the nearest penny, for an action. 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 That's all. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.360
 When only one &lt;i&gt; tick &lt;/i&gt;, the quotation scale, or a price changes ... 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.400
 this is where the game starts. 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.880
 When this tick varies, the world is divided between the winners ... 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.400
 and the losers. 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.760
 The machine behind the major financial markets ... 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.040
 made of mathematical models ... 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.560
 data centers and kilometers of fiber optic cables ... 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 is camouflaged by technological complexity and confidentiality. 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.040
 The creators of this financial system are new employees of Wall Street: 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.240
 quants ... 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.640
 mathematicians and physicists ... 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.000
 responsible for a technological revolution. 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.240
 Haim Bodek is a quant. 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.280
 Specialized in artificial intelligence, he worked for Hull Trading ... 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.080
 and Goldman Sachs. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.280
 He knows the system from the inside, he participated in its creation. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.880
 One day, I was called and advised to contact Haim Bodek ... 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.200
 because he had information on high frequency trading ... 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.280
 a subject that we dealt with in the "Battle of the Quants". So I called him. 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.400
 Listening to Haim Bodek speak was like opening Pandora's box. 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.920
 He entered the system to gain access to a series of files ... 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.920
 containing information that is incredible, according to the public. 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.880
 No one was talking about types of orders before Haim landed. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.960
 I heard what Haim was talking about: 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.160
 order types which, if used properly ... 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.600
 can guarantee profit. 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.480
 Several people in the audience knew that, they cowered ... 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.160
 they wondered who he was, and why he was revealing it all ... 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.760
 why he wasted our opportunity ... 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.160
 to generate income on the financial market. 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.440
 There were quite a few Russians. 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.520
 One of them came to me and said to me: 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.120
 "I know what you are doing. I am with you ... 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.080
 "if you ever need help, someone ... 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.440
 "I have contacts." 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.880
 I said to him, "Am I at a conference as for?" 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.240
 And these are just the reactions of others. I said to myself : 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.120
 "Look, it's just geeks who did this ... 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.200
 "I don't think I'm going against the crowd, or anything like that." 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.080
 2011, Bodek's high frequency trading business, Trading Machines ... 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.520
 went bankrupt. 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.200
 According to Bodek, it's because of a wrong type of order ... 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.720
 or the way he told the Stock Exchange to execute his order. 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.080
 This is not the installation I had before. 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.160
 But hey, it will be fine. 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.080
 When we launched Trading Machines ... 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.120
 we knew which machines were slower ... 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.720
 we knew which companies were slower than us ... 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.800
 and which were faster than us ... 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.520
 because we have negotiated with these companies. 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.920
 Were you as fast as the others? 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.440
 No, we were faster than them. 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.280
 Take a second ... 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.080
 it looks like it's a lifetime of transactions ... 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.000
 between these algorithms that we don't even see. 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.280
 It was Bartt C. Kellerman who invited Haim Bodek to tell his story ... 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.520
 at the "Battle of the Quants", a seminar during which analysts discuss ... 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.080
 high frequency trading, among others. 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.400
 When you buy a stock, you buy it at a price ... 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.200
 and the next person who buys it has to pay more. 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.440
 This margin is the advantage ... 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.040
 which many of these THF organizations could benefit from. 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.160
 These are minute quantities. 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.680
 But if the action is repeated millions of times, it creates huge income. 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.720
 10 years ago, these analysts created a model, used on the market ... 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.080
 then they went to the beach to relax ... 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.800
 and counted their money at the end of the day. 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.240
 Bodek created an algorithm for Trading Machines ... 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.920
 supposed to guarantee an income. 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.160
 A slot machine that withstood the financial collapse of 2008. 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.360
 But overnight, the algorithm stopped working. 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.440
 I started to observe behaviors on certain exchanges ... 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.160
 who were strange. 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.520
 This algorithm did not allow transactions ... 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.600
 even if it varied the price ... 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.880
 no one was trading the stocks. 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.040
 I go back and look for the code that has changed. 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.760
 There are millions of codes. 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.440
 The model I see has nothing to do with all the anomalies I have seen. 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.200
 It's like a rule: never accuse others, the market, traders ... 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.400
 it's always your fault, your code is wrong. 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.600
 We had to wait 12 months, from that day ... 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.920
 to explain it to me. And it was explained to me in person. 

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.760
 That's why I haven't discovered it before. 

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.480
 I was there, I was looking for what mistake we had made. 

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:25.240
 I went to a seminar, organized by this scholarship ... 

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.600
 and I said, "I'm sorry, I have a problem." 

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.960
 Who were you talking to? - A type of business development ... 

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.600
 whose job is to improve growth on the stock market. 

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.120
 He explained to me that my order was systematically disadvantaged ... 

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.160
 because I was using the wrong type of order. 

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.440
 I will not accuse the asymmetries of the financial market of what happened. 

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.160
 But I must say that I wasted a year of my life ... 

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.120
 to look for something that I could have learned by having a drink. 

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.080
 What was your first reaction? 

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.240
 I was humiliated. 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.560
 I wondered how I could not have known. 

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.200
 Bodek thought he understood the cogs ... 

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.640
 of our automated financial markets. 

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.160
 But he did not follow social codes ... 

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.160
 from the world of high frequency trading. 

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.920
 Some traders had found a way to place their order first. 

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.160
 Bodek started out in a pioneering company in automatic trading ... 

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.360
 in Chicago, at Hull Trading. 

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:49.120
 The process we used to hire people was very strict. 

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.640
 It was quite difficult to get a job at Hull Trading. 

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.920
 Blair Hull is a trading legend, a math genius. 

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.720
 Hull made his first fortune at the blackjack tables in Las Vegas. 

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.960
 With this money, he created Hull Trading. 

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.800
 With his analysts, he was a forerunner of financial market automation. 

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.240
 In 1977, I went to the &lt;i&gt; Pacific Exchange &lt;/i&gt; ... 

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.480
 and I realized that all the paper on the floor didn't need to exist ... 

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.440
 I thought that a good programmer could automate all of this in one or two years. 

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.200
 I understood well what turn things would take. 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.880
 But it happened 30 years later. 

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.200
 Those entering Hull Trading did not want to work on Wall Street. 

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.440
 They entered to be surrounded by very intelligent people ... 

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.400
 to solve incredible problems. 

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.160
 It was not seen as a job on Wall Street. 

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:58.320
 I never would have thought of applying for an investment bank. 

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.320
 I'm more from the world of Google, not that of Goldman Sachs ... 

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.680
 even if it went well with them. 

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.880
 Our research on the origins of the technological revolution ... 

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.200
 that has affected the financial markets in recent decades ... 

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.320
 led us to an even more legendary trader: Thomas Peterffy. 

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.000
 We have everything here, the American flag, nature ... 

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.680
 We are 50 minutes from New York, the weather is good, it's good. 

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.760
 At 21, Petterfy fled Communist Hungary. 

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.080
 He is one of the first to see the enormous potential ... 

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.240
 automatic trading. 

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.800
 With his company Interactive Brokers ... 

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.840
 his net worth is estimated at $ 6 billion. 

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.840
 He receives us in his "office". 

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.840
 I have the first touch pad ... 

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.360
 that I created in 1983. 

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.840
 Those on the floor used it. 

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.200
 It was connected to a battery. 

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:39.000
 And here you could display options ... 

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.440
 with the strike price and the expiration date. 

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.080
 There were the offers. 

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.400
 Thus, the negotiators of the prosecution could know the state of the market. 

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.200
 And thanks to these tactile keys ... 

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.680
 Is it a touch screen? - Yes. 

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.680
 What year? - 1983. 

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.640
 How were the others doing? 

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.280
 The others, well, they used their brains. 

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.480
 Have you patented it? 

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.280
 No, I don't believe in patents, I think patents ... 

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.400
 prevent people from inventing new things. 

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.200
 So the other people copied you? 

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.840
 Of course, the others have always copied me. 

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.800
 But it's nothing, it moves the world. 

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.560
 If there was a computer on the floor in early 1980 ... 

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.680
 it was not directly connected to the price in real time. 

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.960
 My computer was in the office. I went up by the elevator ... 

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.520
 I launched my computer, went down again, executed the transactions ... 

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.720
 then I walked, went up, restarted the computer and went down again. 

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.880
 I couldn't get a price in real time. 

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.080
 The first time we had an option on the parquet ... 

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.080
 to enter an S&amp;P 500 price, we had a "human counter". 

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.720
 It was a person looking at the screen ... 

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.440
 and raise or lower the price to make sure it was the same. 

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.320
 These were the rules that the stock market followed to ensure ... 

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.160
 that people weren't going to switch to automation. 

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:32.080
 We found a way to join the cable ... 

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.800
 to which the keyboard was connected ... 

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.440
 and we used the functions of the keys on a computer. 

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:47.160
 So it was much faster, we didn't need to use the keyboard. 

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.120
 A NASDAQ agent came and saw it and said, "You can't do this." 

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.560
 I asked him why, he replied, "Because ... 

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.760
 "According to the rules, all orders must be entered using the keyboard." 

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.640
 So we decided to create ... 

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:14.040
 keyboard cover with pistons, rubber fingers ... 

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.400
 going up and down and typing. 

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.960
 The only problem is that it made a lot of noise. 

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.120
 The next time, when the agent came back ... 

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.760
 he heard this crazy noise. 

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.560
 Orders were flowing. And he didn't know what to do. 

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.880
 He stayed watching for a while, then he left. 

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.160
 We never heard from him again. 

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.160
 In the 90s, the establishment of Wall Street realizes ... 

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.480
 that it is lagging behind the technological revolution. 

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.680
 Just before turning century, Blair Hull sells his business ... 

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.680
 as well as its employees ... 

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.600
 to investment bank Goldman Sachs for half a billion dollars. 

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.920
 As Hull was bought out, I was able to get involved with Goldman. 

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.880
 We often joked about it in Hull. 

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.320
 We were all given personality tests. 

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.480
 And the type of personality I was given ... 

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.080
 was, roughly, that of a mad scientist. 

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.280
 For about 9 months, people were worried ... 

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.440
 because I work in a bank. 

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.400
 I spent a good part of my life, my childhood ... 

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.600
 surrounded by physicists in physics laboratories. 

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.680
 What did your father say when you started working at the bank? 

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.800
 I think he was not very happy about Goldman. 

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.920
 In this universe, people were exceptional. 

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:16.360
 I remember that I met, during small parties, at the age of 8 years old ... 

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.520
 so and so who won the Nobel Prize. 

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.080
 My father said to me, "Come and shake their hands." 

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.920
 You should know that some had created nuclear bombs. 

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.280
 These people believed that science would make the world a better place. 

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.520
 And that the way to make the world a better place ... 

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.600
 was to understand, create and discover. 

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.280
 Around the world, people watch high finance and have to think: 

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.800
 "Why use your intelligence like this?" 

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.240
 "Always make more money than others, is that genius?" 

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.400
 The team of geniuses in mathematics and physics ... 

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:09.440
 who chose to work in finance has automated 70% of transactions ... 

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.200
 and allowed 50% of them to happen in a few milliseconds. 

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.320
 We call this high frequency trading, or THF. 

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.000
 THF has nothing to do with the economy. 

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.280
 It's about understanding how networks work ... 

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.200
 how they plant, how to make them plant ... 

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.480
 and how to plant them to your advantage without being discovered. 

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.520
 Eric Hunsader's business, Nanex, sells financial data. 

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.840
 Out of curiosity, he searches for abnormal patterns in data flows. 

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.720
 He knows what is going on in the financial markets, down to the millisecond. 

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.840
 Eric, where are you taking us? 

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.200
 I'm taking you to the CME office in Aurora, Illinois. 

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.480
 The CME is in the center of Chicago. 

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.640
 Yes, as long as the New York Stock Exchange is in the center of New York. 

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.800
 That's where the machines, the data centers are. 

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.120
 The building on the left houses the CME data center. 

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.280
 It looks huge! - It is. 

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:25.240
 Billions of dollars are traded in the futures markets. 

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.360
 When you send orders to sell and buy, this is where it happens. 

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.120
 What are these poles, these antennas for? 

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.720
 It's to make it happen faster in New York. 

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.520
 I do not recommend it, but if you climbed this tower ... 

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.560
 if you look in the direction that this parable indicates ... 

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.480
 and if you had a telescope, you might see the next one. 

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:55.880
 I thought they were using fiberglass, fiberglass cables. 

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.040
 It's more direct. For the speed of light, we speak of distance. 

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:07.240
 And in fact, light travels faster in the air than in the fiber. 

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:26.440
 Everything is played to the nearest nanosecond. 

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.320
 You just have to be faster than the others. 

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.360
 It's really not that great. There, there is a relay. 

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.360
 Several things can cause signal loss: 

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:47.160
 the fresnel effect, the atmospheric conditions ... 

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.520
 or the balloon of a child who takes off at the wrong time. 

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.040
 Bodek's Trading Machines also made a profit from THF. 

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.240
 If it had been a fair match ... 

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.600
 if I had really lost, I would have wanted a lot. 

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.760
 I would have looked after my ego, I would have shown humility. 

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:23.120
 I knew from my own judgment where I screwed up or not. 

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.560
 Trading Machines, the THF company of Haim Bodek ... 

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.240
 closed for good in January 2011. 

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.800
 I had heard of Trading Machines, but I did not know Haim. 

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.360
 I figured I could meet him. 

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.080
 We met soon after. 

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.960
 It was a few months after the closing of Trading Machines. 

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.800
 It's no coincidence that Bodek started talking to Scott Patterson ... 

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.360
 a Wall Street Journal reporter. 

00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.280
 Patterson has been following high frequency trading closely for years. 

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.360
 Without knowing each other, Bodek and Patterson both ... 

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.680
 analyzed conflicts of interest between the THF industry ... 

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.960
 and the stock exchanges for a certain period. 

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.240
 We ended up in a Starbucks in Manhattan. 

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:23.760
 And I remember precisely, towards the end of our conversation ... 

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.320
 Haim said something about ... 

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.280
 illegal action in the market. 

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.160
 He thought that was partly why Trading Machines had closed. 

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:42.360
 I had an organization chart with all the people ... 

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.360
 the highest placed in THF, in my bag ... 

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:52.080
 and other data that was part of my business information. 

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.120
 He had worked on it a lot, but it was very vague. 

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.120
 Did you give him these documents? 

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.440
 I let him take a look at it. 

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.240
 I said, "You have to tell me what it is." 

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:12.240
 I have spoken so many times in my career to people who say they know something ... 

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.920
 which may be illegal, something rigged at some point. 

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:24.440
 But they don't say more, it's still very vague. 

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.680
 I remember the first interview I had with him ... 

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.160
 we sat down, it must have been 10:30 am. 

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.400
 And we started talking for 7 hours straight. 

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.560
 I didn't eat anything, I had to drink a glass of water. 

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.040
 I sat there, listened to Haim, and took notes. 

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:00.040
 My computer's battery has run down, I took notes by hand. 

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.600
 Because he really said it all. 

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.840
 I'll try to explain this to you with a metaphor. 

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.560
 It's a circus. I will tell you the facts through comedy. 

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.880
 But unfortunately, it looks like that. 

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.600
 Here's a concert hall, let's say it's Metallica playing. 

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.960
 I like metal, so it's Metallica who plays in this concert hall. 

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.840
 The ticket office opens at 6 p.m. 

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.120
 So I'm going to stand in line. 

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.960
 After a while, people arrive, I am no longer the last in line. 

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.040
 There are resellers. 

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.200
 They are also in the queue, with me. 

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.400
 I recognize them by their t-shirt, they all wear the same. 

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:59.280
 They are also in close collaboration with the Bourse, the concert hall. 

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.080
 What kind of collaboration? 

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:11.120
 Perhaps one of them brings a significant volume. 

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.360
 That is to say, he buys a lot of tickets. 

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.600
 Obviously, he sells them to the spectators. One has a lot ... 

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.240
 another reseller owns 10% of the room. 

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.840
 A third dealer does not have much ... 

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.040
 but it largely has another room ... 

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.600
 and he has a seat on the board of directors of this room. 

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.360
 So there is a very close collaboration ... 

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.280
 between these dealers and the concert hall. 

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.760
 Metallica tickets sold on the black. 

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.720
 I will draw a parallel between the opening of the counter ... 

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:02.560
 and when a price may change, on the financial market. 

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.160
 At 6 p.m. that's what I'm going to attend. 

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.880
 Absolutely all these resellers ... 

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.440
 will literally teleport, in a picosecond. 

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.000
 They are all there in front of me. 

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.680
 How come ? I ask someone who answers me: 

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.720
 "They are very fast." 

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.120
 I said, "No, they teleported. They were behind me." 

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.720
 There is no difference between an order type and the one wearing the t-shirt. 

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:44.200
 You add a code to your order saying, "Respect me, please." 

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.240
 How did you hear about Haim Bodek? 

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:57.480
 I met him at Blair Hull's, he invited me to dinner. 

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.240
 What did you think of him? 

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.040
 He's great, he knows everything, we started talking about work in 5 minutes. 

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:11.600
 Have you noticed the same thing as him in your data? 

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:19.640
 No, we don't know who executed an order unless ... 

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.960
 We do not know who is carrying out the orders. 

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.840
 But he knows who executed his. 

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.000
 And he knows what market. 

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:36.000
 He thought his order should be the next to be executed ... 

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.720
 but it was not. It is impossible to know. 

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.000
 When someone started to explain to me, it was easy to understand the rest. 

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.880
 But if you don't know there are resellers ... 

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.800
 who will use certain types of orders to double you, buy tickets ... 

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.160
 and resell them to those who queue ... 

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.360
 If you don't know that a considerable number of transactions are taking place ... 

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.320
 if you don't know how it works ... 

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.200
 you believe what you see on the price stream. 

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.680
 Who is organizing this? - He's not a businessman ... 

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.120
 who created these characteristics. 

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.880
 Very few people have the technical skills ... 

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.280
 to create these characteristics. 

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.000
 Less than 10 people. 

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.200
 10? - Less than 10 people. 

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.960
 Do you know them all? 

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.640
 I know several of them personally, but not all. 

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.120
 I know their work well. 

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.400
 What was the function of the algorithms that you designed at Citadel? 

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.040
 I can't tell you that. 

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.720
 I'm really scared of Citadel lawyers. 

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:03.000
 Dave Lauer was a trader and analyst at Allston and Citadel, THF companies. 

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.600
 He testified as an expert at the Senate committee hearing ... 

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.920
 on high frequency trading. 

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.360
 Like Bodek, he is one of the few initiates ... 

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.880
 who talked about their experiences. 

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.880
 At the top, there is THF ... 

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.480
 and trading for own account in major banks. 

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.280
 These are the main ... 

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:35.480
 This is the part that everyone is trying to observe or integrate. 

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.360
 Below, there is the Stock Exchange. 

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.600
 And the stock market economic model concerns volume. 

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.600
 The stock exchanges are doing everything to attract THF ... 

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.000
 in their premises, and therefore, to attract volume. 

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.440
 Couriers are those who transmit orders to stock exchanges ... 

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.120
 and they earn money from the commissions of their "buy-siders". 

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.600
 At the bottom of the pyramid, there is the "buy side" ... 

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.120
 which brings together pension funds and investment funds. 

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.280
 These are the investors, those who are there ... 

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.400
 because they think a business has a solid foundation or a future. 

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.280
 The amount of money generated by all of these parties ... 

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.640
 represents the cost ... - Yes, it is the cost of transactions. 

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.280
 When an investment or pension fund executes a large order ... 

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.800
 what is this order in traders' jargon called? 

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.800
 It's donated money ... 

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:39.920
 it's easy money, it's cake ... 

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.520
 this is what is expected. 

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.360
 These algorithms are used to detect what is happening. 

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.320
 It's about understanding when institutions buy and sell. 

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.640
 They are waiting for my pension money to reach ... 

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.680
 Yes, they will bite you a little. 

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.800
 It is a slow death. We put you aside ... 

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.800
 at the time this order goes through the system. 

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.040
 You have to be on the other side of the transaction to make money. 

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.400
 It's been like this for a long time, people are used to it, they accept it. 

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.240
 They know they are being scammed. 

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.920
 On Wall Street, you are necessarily scammed unless you are the scammer. 

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:37.200
 Those who put their money in pension and investment funds ... 

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.000
 they don't understand what's going on. 

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.400
 If they understood that the banks ... 

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:50.640
 take their money and declare it as profit ... 

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.560
 they would do something. 

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.720
 But the problem is, it's too complicated for people to understand. 

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.880
 I thought it was funny when the problem of order types broke out. 

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.160
 It is obvious that many people did not know ... 

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.320
 that these markets offered special order types. 

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:19.440
 90% of financiers do not know how the American stock market works. 

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.720
 Before, it was the brokers who owned the stock exchanges. 

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.320
 They were integrating new businesses into the financial market ... 

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:49.160
 hoping to sell the stocks of these companies to their clients ... 

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.880
 and obtain fees for this sale. 

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.560
 These businesses would grow, be successful, and everything would be fine. 

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.680
 On the other hand, what is different in all of this ... 

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.760
 is that these scholarships were acquired in majority ... 

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.680
 by companies with private capital. 

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.280
 They are not necessarily intended ... 

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.720
 develop small businesses and get them listed on the stock market ... 

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.760
 but rather to generate monthly income. 

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.440
 High frequency trading ensures a gain for each transaction. 

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.560
 So if we manage to make transactions frequently ... 

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:33.560
 the profits generated make it possible to create a profit. 

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.320
 These THF companies benefit from the complexity ... 

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:43.120
 as they understand it, their function is to study the market structure. 

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.160
 They understand and exploit market inefficiencies. 

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.360
 The scholarships are over ... 

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.440
 places where companies attracted investors ... 

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.280
 to data centers where wars are waged by algorithms ... 

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.040
 who transact at the speed of light. 

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.000
 An invisible world which, during a sudden collapse ... 

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.200
 the infamous 2010 lightning crash ... 

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.640
 saw $ 862 billion evaporate ... 

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.400
 in a few minutes on the American financial market. 

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.720
 Wow! Almost 1000 points! 

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.280
 We call it a capitulation. 

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.320
 They will suspend the transactions, we cannot stop the sale. 

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.080
 For me, the lightning crash was a defining moment. 

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.320
 I couldn't ignore it. 

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.800
 I was on the THF floor. 

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.480
 Everything was fine, finally, the markets were down 2.5%. 

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.760
 We saw the riots in Greece on television. 

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.840
 Each time they rioted, the markets went down. 

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.360
 I remember watching, each floor broadcast CNBC. 

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.720
 I saw that the Dow Jones index lost 100 points ... 

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.840
 I said to myself: "Too bad", and I continued to work. 

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.600
 A minute later, I see that he lost another 100 points. 

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.840
 I get up and go to the futures traders office. 

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.400
 They are very restless, they don't know what's going on. 

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.800
 They had a lot of orders on the market, it's chaos. 

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.160
 100 more points are lost. 

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.080
 The CEO of the company comes running and shouts: 

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.840
 "Stop it all!" 

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.640
 They press the buttons, they turn everything off. 

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.440
 We are all grouped around these two screens. 

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.280
 On a screen, we look at the accounts ... 

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.880
 this is the futures market, people are ready to buy ... 

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.520
 and others for sale is the market. 

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.840
 As we look at the screen, the orders begin to decrease ... 

00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:00.000
 orders are canceled, they decrease further, they disappear from the screen ... 

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.640
 and then there is nothing left. There was no more market. 

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.560
 For a few seconds, there was no more market. 

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.000
 We are all seated, we observe the emptiness. 

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.640
 We have no idea what's going to happen. 

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.880
 I thought something horrible had just happened ... 

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.520
 something indescribable, the market was gone. 

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.840
 I called my bargaining office and said: 

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.920
 "What is happening ?" They replied, "We don't know." 

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.080
 I said, "What are you doing? Are you expanding your markets?" 

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.800
 They said that is what they were doing. I thought there was only that to do. 

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.000
 Let's wait until it stops. 

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.680
 We were almost nauseated, we were worried ... 

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.840
 we didn't know if the world was going to stop. 

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.840
 Even the September 11 attacks did not have this impact. 

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:58.040
 Things returned to normal, the market started again ... 

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.760
 it went up suddenly, activities resumed. 

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.120
 Personally, I changed after that. 

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.600
 That day, I stopped believing in capitalism ... 

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.720
 finally, to the capitalism that we had built. 

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.440
 I had lost confidence in this system. 

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.800
 My friend has a doctorate in climate science, he worked at Harvard. 

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.480
 Next to me, there was a doctoral student in bioinformatics ... 

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.320
 on the other side, a semiconductor designer ... 

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.080
 behind me, someone who had a master's degree in math from MIT. 

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.200
 These people mobilize their impressive gray matter ... 

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.880
 and use it to make money in a THF system. 

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.040
 I couldn't justify it anymore. 

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.800
 They should have worked in research ... 

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.280
 against cancer or climate change. 

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.440
 And there they were, earning a fortune. 

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.640
 Were the markets, their efficiency, their stability improved? 

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.680
 That day, we knew we weren't. 

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.680
 It's bad. 

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.240
 There you know you have to stop. 

00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:03.640
 We spent the whole day doing this. This algorithm brought in 200 dollars. 

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.160
 It has gone back to 471 now. 

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.120
 It balances. 

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.240
 It’s going down. Are you busy with options? 

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.880
 Yes, but that option ... - You take care of it. 

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.080
 The market is closed. 

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.720
 I just bought this share from Facebook and the rate has changed, what an idiot! 

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.640
 What a moron ! 

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.200
 Now, I have 500 Facebook contracts in the day-to-day market. 

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.800
 I thought it was 3 a.m. 

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.880
 We manage hedge funds here. 

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.320
 We lead a community of traders. 

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.040
 We started from nothing. 

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:03.000
 I'm from Los Angeles, our main trader is from Boston. 

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.480
 We decided to come here and try to make a fortune. 

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.160
 This is Bryan Wiener. 

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.000
 He was head of traders at Trading Machines ... 

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.560
 which was led by this man, Haim Bodek ... 

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.320
 the "killer drug trafficker" is what it's called here. 

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.240
 He teaches us about microstructure ... 

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.360
 and we use it to try to become better traders. 

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.480
 I have fun watching these guys challenge the machines. 

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.640
 And they get there, it's fascinating, considering what's going on in this sector. 

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.720
 Peter Zhang and his friends rented an apartment in Manhattan ... 

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.600
 to launch hedge funds. 

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.520
 They just started working with Haim Bodek ... 

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:55.720
 to develop an algorithm that simulates the bold behavior of a trader. 

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.880
 Charlie lives here. It was supposed to be an office ... 

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.520
 it has become a tropical jungle. 

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.360
 He lives there pretty well, he has his own fan, his own bathroom. 

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.480
 Anand is our main trader, he has the largest room in the world. 

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.400
 This is the master bedroom. 

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.760
 Obviously, there is everything you need, it is a very large room ... 

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.000
 he pays a large part of the rent. 

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.560
 Most of the time, after working, when you're exhausted ... 

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.960
 we land on the sofas. 

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.800
 We're always together, that's where we hang out ... 

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.800
 this is also where I sleep. Here is my comforter. 

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.040
 I should tidy up a bit. - Where does Haim sleep when he stays? 

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.760
 When Haim stays, he sleeps there. 

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.880
 We contacted him via Twitter, we called him ... 

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.400
 he looked like a genius on the phone. 

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.760
 We told him he should come here ... 

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.440
 to see our work, which he would love, that we could associate. 

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.160
 He disembarks, he walks at full speed. 

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.360
 He's wearing a suit that is too big for him, and he says, "Hi, is this rolling?" 

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.320
 Anand has prepared a list of questions to ask Haim Bodek. 

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.480
 I said, "Okay, we'll do that." 

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.480
 And we see that Haim does something special, we call it "doing Haim". 

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.840
 He never stops, the genius is released. 

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.200
 He is highly respected, he has a lot of experience. 

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.400
 He has an impressive curriculum. 

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.320
 But no one forgets that he was a high frequency trader ... 

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.840
 and that his system failed. 

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.440
 This is why the industry has a certain image of him. 

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.280
 Some say it is not credible ... 

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.480
 let this or that no longer happen today. 

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.600
 But no fact proves it. 

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.960
 After talking to Scott Patterson, who published Bodek's revelations ... 

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.360
 in his book "Dark Pools" ... 

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:23.600
 Bodek decided to go to the American financial market authorities, the SEC. 

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.840
 On Wall Street, there is a culture of confidentiality. 

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.200
 It doesn't happen, going to the SEC ... 

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:38.160
 and tell them what's going on internally on Wall Street ... 

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:43.080
 how things work. You are an outcast if you do that. 

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.880
 And I say to myself: 

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.640
 Everything will disappear. Someone will speak, it will disappear overnight. 

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.000
 These are just a few lines of code, the basics. 

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.120
 Everything is artificial. 

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.080
 Bodek's complaint is registered with the SEC market authorities. 

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.760
 The investigation has been going on for 2 years now. 

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.800
 The SEC does not provide details on its progress. 

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.640
 The SEC has taken no action, and it's been two years already. 

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.760
 And we know that they tend to fine the stock markets ... 

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.040
 and to make sure that things work properly. 

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.760
 So either nothing happens, or it's so complicated that it takes years. 

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:35.240
 It is obvious that trading companies are much more sophisticated ... 

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.200
 than the SEC. 

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.480
 I think they are very intelligent. 

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.880
 They can go to the SEC and explain why they want a type of order ... 

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.400
 why it's useful for the rest of the market, and appear very credible ... 

00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.040
 without saying that it will allow them to earn millions every day ... 

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.400
 and that it will save them money. 

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.600
 I think that proprietary trading companies benefit from the rules. 

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.800
 We have created rules that should not have been created. 

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:18.440
 And we have created order types that are closely monitored by the SEC. 

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.240
 I don't think we can criticize THF companies ... 

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.080
 who followed the rules. 

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.920
 Can we really expect the financial authorities to adapt ... 

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.920
 state-of-the-art technology? 

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.560
 The lightning crash was followed ... 

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.880
 many computer problems. 

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.680
 Like those that took place during the Facebook public offering ... 

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.480
 the Twitter crash when the White House explosions were announced ... 

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:48.200
 or the time Goldman Sachs lost $ 100 million ... 

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.840
 in 17 minutes due to an incorrect algorithm. 

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.520
 In a universe surrounded by silence and confidentiality ... 

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.480
 no one seems to understand what's going on or to control the situation. 

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.520
 The market, the interactions in the industry between these companies ... 

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.680
 to extremely complex technological systems ... 

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.960
 their operation ... 

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.040
 make the whole stock market system, high frequency trading ... 

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.680
 and technologies, very complex. 

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.880
 The lightning crash is a perfect example. 

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.920
 There is no cause and effect to be determined. 

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.920
 There is no need to wonder what is the cause of the lightning crash. 

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.560
 It doesn't make sense in the context of a complex system. 

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.280
 If the same events happened again, in the same way ... 

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.520
 there is no guarantee that it would cause a lightning crash. 

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.360
 It is the nature of a complex system. 

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.680
 Is it true that many traders don't understand the market? 

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.280
 I don't think anyone understands. 

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:07.280
 This is another characteristic of complex systems: 

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.960
 they really go beyond human understanding. 

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.000
 Because we don't know ... 

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.680
 We understand very well what our algorithms, our technology do ... 

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.040
 but once there is interaction with all the other systems ... 

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.680
 it's very difficult to know what's going to happen. 

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:48.280
 What did your father say when he knew you were an informer? 

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.760
 What I have done is consistent with the values ​​that have been instilled in me. 

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.160
 Didn't he tell you, "I warned you"? 

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:03.600
 I really think it's consistent with his vision of finance. 

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.360
 When you make the front page of a newspaper, you are supposed to keep a copy. 

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.920
 The title : 

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.240
 "A way to outperform others for high frequency traders." 

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.680
 About Wall Street culture ... 

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.280
 I think people don't realize how much fear reigns. 

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:34.280
 There are a lot of people on Wall Street who think ... 

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.320
 that they are very determined and deserving. 

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:45.400
 But at the level of daily life ... 

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.480
 fear is constant. 

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:54.280
 If we don't listen to good music ... 

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.320
 when parking in the parking lot ... 

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.800
 Literally? - Yes, there is so much fear. 

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.840
 The hierarchy is very marked, especially in investment banks. 

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.560
 For them, I did the most frightening, unimaginable thing. 

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:16.280
 The idea of ​​being in financial distress ... 

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:21.680
 to have his reputation tainted, to be rejected ... 

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.880
 it's their worst nightmare. 

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.040
 It was on the rise yesterday, tomorrow, it will do. 

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:42.440
 There is not a rule saying: Do not sell short the first day? 

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.280
 The only rule is: Do not short sell on Tuesday. 

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.600
 It was a courier who was walking his dog who told me that. 

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:55.480
 What is difficult is not really to be exonerated ... 

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.760
 it's already done. 

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.760
 The problem is what happens next. Where am I going now?
