THOUGH -- AND I WANT TO PUT THIS
UP, NOT TO BRING UP ANY BAD

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:50.683
MEMORIES OR ANYTHING -- YOU WERE
HERE IN SEPTEMBER LAST TIME AND

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.419 align:start position:0%
JUST DAYS AFTER YOU WERE HERE,
YOU HAD A HEART ATTACK.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:57.223 align:start position:0%
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR HOW
TOUGH I WAS ON YOU.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.325 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start position:0%
GILLIBRAND WAS HER AND HER
KIDNEYS FAILED.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.329
&gt;&gt; I KNOCKED ON WOOD THAT NIGHT.

TURNS OUT, THIS IS PLASTIC.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:05.264 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT IS.

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.232 align:start position:0%
IT IS.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.867 size:78% position:39%
I APOLOGIZE TO YOU AGAIN.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.235 align:start position:0%
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.170 align:start position:0%
OKAY.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.506 align:start position:0%
THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT IN
THE WORLD AND THE CAMPAIGN.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:20.746
I'D LIKE TO START OFF WITH THE
RECENT POSSIBLY WAR WITH IRAN.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:24.150 align:start position:0%
THE UNITED STATES, JUST TO
RECAP, WE SENT A DRONE STRIKE AT

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:31.891
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMAND TO KILL
HEAD OF THE QUDS FORCE QASEM

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.860 align:start position:0%
SOLEIMANI.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:36.996
NIKKI HALEY HAS SAID THE ONLY
PEOPLE MOURNING SOLEIMANI ARE

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.130 align:start position:0%
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:40.600 size:88% position:44%
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY DEMOCRATIC

ARE YOU MOURNING SOLEIMANI?

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.705 align:start position:0%
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY BACK
WITH NIKKI HALEY RIGHT NOW,

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.940
PERHAPS WITH A FRAGRANT GESTURE?

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:51.744 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; NO, NOBODY I KNOW IS MOURNING

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:58.818
SOLEIMANI, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU KNOW, STEPHEN, I THINK ABOUT

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:02.355 align:start position:0%
THE MODERN HISTORY OF THIS
COUNTRY, AND I REMEMBER VIETNAM,

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:06.225 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS MY GENERATION, AND I
REMEMBER THE WAR IN IRAQ.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:10.196
THOSE ARE THE TWO WORST FOREIGN
POLICY BLUNDERS IN THE MODERN

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.301 align:start position:0%
HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, AND
BOTH OF THOSE WARS WERE BUILT ON

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:16.169 align:start position:0%
LIES.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:20.373 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I JUST WANT TO

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.776 align:start position:0%
POINT OUT THAT CANDIDATE TRUMP
AGREED WITH YOU.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: CANDIDATE TRUMP

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
AGREED THAT IRAQ WAS THE WORST
DECISION.

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:31.717
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT HERE'S THE POINT --
THE POINT IS THAT BOTH OF THOSE

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.756 align:start position:0%
WARS WHICH CAUSED SUCH
INCREDIBLE SUFFERING IN OUR

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.892 align:start position:0%
COUNTRY -- 59,000 AMERICAN
SOLDIERS DEAD AS A RESULT OF THE

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:43.129 align:start position:0%
VIETNAM WAR, PROBABLY MORE DIED
AFTER THEY CAME BACK, A

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.731 align:start position:0%
GENERATION REALLY ENORMOUSLY
IMPACTED.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:50.469 align:start position:0%
THE WAR IN IRAQ, 4500 OF OUR
PEOPLE, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.871 align:start position:0%
IRAQIS DEAD.

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:54.907
WE SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
THAT SHOULD BE INVESTED IN

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.045 align:start position:0%
HEALTHCARE, IN EDUCATION, IN
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:03.983 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT IN

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.086 align:start position:0%
THAT WAR BASED ON A LAW YOU
REMEMBER.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.522 size:81% position:41%
YOU REMEMBER IT VERY WELL.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.357 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SURE, YEAH.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
YEAH.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:18.431
WE WERE TOLD -- WE WERE TOLD
THAT SADDAM HAD MASS WEAPONS OF

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:23.436 align:start position:0%
MASS DESTRUCTION, CHEMICAL
WEAPONS TIED INTO AL QUAIDA, ALL

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.605 align:start position:0%
ALIKE, AND ALL OF THAT
SUFFERING.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.608 align:start position:0%
AT THE END OF ALL OF THAT, ALL
OF THE DEATH, ALL OF THE

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.577
SUFFERING, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OF EXPENDITURES, WE GET BOOTED

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.780 align:start position:0%
OUT OF IRAQ, THEY NO LONGER WANT
US THERE.

00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:38.851
SO I WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT I
CAN TO STOP A WAR WITH IRAN THAT

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:40.453 size:84% position:42%
I THINK WILL BE A DISASTER.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:49.829 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.632 size:88% position:44%
ADMINISTRATION, AS YOU WAS
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IN THE

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.867
SHOW, THE ADMINISTRATION SENT
REPRESENTATIVES BOTH IN THE

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.041 align:start position:0%
MILITARY AND FROM THE CABINET TO
HAVE A BRIEFING AT THE SENATE

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:02.675 align:start position:0%
YESTERDAY.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:04.443 size:88% position:44%
WERE YOU AT THESE BRIEFINGS?

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:05.377 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MIKE LEE CALLED
THESE INSULTING.

00:04:07.112 --> 00:04:10.349 size:88% position:44%
DID YOU FIND THEM INSULTING?

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:15.154 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I AM SO USED TO TRUMP
THAT I -- YOU KNOW, AND HIS

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.424 align:start position:0%
ADMINISTRATION THAT NOTHING
SURPRISES ME.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:19.458 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ISN'T THAT PART OF

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:24.096 align:start position:0%
THE DANGER OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION THAT WE'RE

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.165
BECOMING DEAFENED TO THE LIES.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:30.169
AND MIKE LEE IS A CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICAN WITH WHOM I DISAGREE

00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
WITH ON ALMOST EVERYTHING BUT HE
AND I HAD WORKED TOGETHER

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.176 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE MIKE IS MAYBE OLD
FASHIONED ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IN

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES.

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:45.584 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING -- AND

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:51.624 align:start position:0%
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT TRUMP I
THINK HAS NOT YET READ OR

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:52.458 align:start position:0%
UNDERSTANDS.

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:53.693 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT WHAT MIKE MADE PUBLIC

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:57.330
TODAY -- WHICH IS TRUE, I WAS
THERE, IN FACT, SIGNATURE RIGHT

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.166
BEHIND HIM -- WHEN ASKED BY THE
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MILITARY

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:09.742 align:start position:0%
AND THE C.I.A. IF, IN FACT,
TRUMP DECIDES TO ASSASSINATE THE

00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:14.747
LEADERSHIP -- THE LEADER -- OF
IRAN, WOULD HE HAVE TO COME TO

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.218 align:start position:0%
CONGRESS FOR AUTHORIZATION, AND
THEY COULD NOT GIVE A CLEAR

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.419 align:start position:0%
ANSWER ON THAT.

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:24.290
AND HERE IS THE POINT THAT I
KNOW THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS,

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:28.494
THE CONSTITUTION IS EXTREMELY
CLEAR, IT IS THE CONGRESS OF

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:34.433 align:start position:0%
UNITED STATES THAT HAS WARMAKING
POWERS, NOT THE PRESIDENT.

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:41.874 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:46.712 align:start position:0%
INTRODUCED LEGISLATION WHICH
WOULD PREVENT SPENDING -- GIVING

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:51.050 align:start position:0%
TRUMP ONE NICKEL OF MONEY TO GO
TO WAR IN IRAN, AND THERE'S

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.953 align:start position:0%
ANOTHER GOOD PIECE OF
LEGISLATION THAT, ONCE AGAIN,

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:57.323
WOULD BRING UP THE WAR POWERS
ACT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE COULD

00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:02.428
NOT GO TO WAR UNLESS HE HAD THE
AUTHORIZATION OF THE CONGRESS.

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:04.864 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT HAS BEEN A LONG

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:08.134
TIME, AND CORRECT ME IF I'M
WRONG HERE, BUT IT HAS BEEN A

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:11.003 align:start position:0%
LONG TIME SINCE CONGRESS HAS
EXERTED THAT POWER.

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:14.774
HOW DO YOU THINK WE GOT HERE
WHERE TRUMP THINKS HE CAN ACT

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.375 align:start position:0%
WITH SUCH IMPUNITY?

00:06:16.408 --> 00:06:20.379
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, AND
IT IS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION THAT

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:23.883
THAT HAS EXISTED, AND I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT I THINK THE ANSWER IS,

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, AND I'VE GOT TO SAY
THIS.

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:30.523 align:start position:0%
IT IS A POLITICIAN, THE
PRESIDENT GETS UP THERE, WE'RE

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:35.194
GOING TO BE TOUGH, THESE ARE
EVIL GUYS, WE'RE GOING TO WAR,

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:35.761 align:start position:0%
WOW!

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:37.396 size:75% position:38%
YOUR POLL RATINGS GO UP!

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:39.965 align:start position:0%
AND PEOPLE SAY, WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT ARE THE UNINTENDED

00:06:39.998 --> 00:06:40.565 align:start position:0%
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT?

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.168 size:78% position:39%
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL DIE?

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.703
HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST US?

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:49.608 align:start position:0%
OH, CANDIDATE X OR CONGRESSMAN X
IS SOFT ON TERROR.

00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:55.347 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN X, HE
DOESN'T WANT TO PROTECT AMERICA,

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.452
ALL RIGHT, AND I REALLY GET VERY
ANGRY AT THAT APPROACH, BECAUSE

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:02.388
WE SIT IN THE CONGRESS IN OUR
BEAUTIFUL ROOMS, BEAUTIFUL

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:06.125 align:start position:0%
STUDIO OVER HERE, AND WE DO NOT
KNOW WHAT WAR IS ABOUT.

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:11.530
WE DIVERT THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF
THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS

00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:12.731 align:start position:0%
AFFAIRS.

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:18.304
I MET WITH THE MOTHERS OF THE
YOUNG MEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:21.974
IN THE WAR, MET WITH THE WIVES,
MET WITH THE KIDS, I MET WITH

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:26.011 align:start position:0%
THE SOLDIERS WHO CAME BACK
WITHOUT ARMS AND LEGS, WHO ARE

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:27.546 size:75% position:38%
DEALING WITH PTSD TODAY.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:31.917 align:start position:0%
WAR IS A HORROR, AND IT'S TIME
POLITICIANS UNDERSTOOD THAT

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:38.524 align:start position:0%
WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING
HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO AVOID WAR.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:43.462 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, STEPHEN,

00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:48.133 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I
KNOW IT IS NOT SEXY TO TALK

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:52.004
ABILITY DIPLOMACY, IT IS NOT
SEXY TO TALK ABOUT MAKING SURE

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
THAT WE HAVE A GREAT STATE
DEPARTMENT WITH PEOPLE WHO KNOW

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:58.644
THE CULTURE AND THE LANGUAGE OF
COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:07:58.677 --> 00:08:02.014 align:start position:0%
I'VE MET SOME OF THE PEOPLE,
THEY DO A GREAT JOB.

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:03.182 align:start position:0%
IT AIN'T SEXY.

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.018 align:start position:0%
IT IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL, IT'S
BETTER TV TO TALK ABOUT HOW

00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:09.121 align:start position:0%
WE'RE GOING TO KILL THIS ONE AND
KILL THAT ONE.

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:12.191 align:start position:0%
BUT I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF END

00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:16.729
LESS WARS, THEY WANT TO IMPROVE
LIVES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:21.534 align:start position:0%
AND, YOU KNOW --
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:26.138 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SOME PEOPLE
JUSTIFYING THIS ARE POINTING AT

00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
THE AUMF OF 2002.

00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:29.141 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:30.543 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE AUTHORIZATION
OF USE OF MILITARY FORCE

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.478
FOLLOWING THE ATTACKS OF 9/11.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:36.515 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I READ THE TEXT
THE OTHER NIGHT, IT SPECIFICALLY

00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:40.653 align:start position:0%
SAYS YOU CAN ONLY GO AFTER
PEOPLE -- YOU'RE AUTHORIZED TO

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.656
GO AFTER PEOPLE, THE PRESIDENT,
IS AND THIS PRESIDENT AS WELL,

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.991 align:start position:0%
TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACKS OR

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:47.693 size:84% position:42%
WHO AIDED IN THOSE ATTACKS.

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:50.763 size:88% position:44%
AND THE 9/11 COMMISSION SAID
THERE WAS NO CONNECTION WITH

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:51.097 align:start position:0%
IRAN.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.198 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:57.670 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO HOW CAN THEY
STILL JUSTIFY USING THAT?

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:02.942 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE -- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RAISING THE RIGHT

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:03.476 align:start position:0%
QUESTION.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.377 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.746 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:16.221 align:start position:0%
WHICH IS LED BY A PRESIDENT WHO
IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:20.225 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
HONESTLY, STEPHEN, I DISAGREE

00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:23.562
WITH MANY MEMBERS IN CONGRESS,
THEY'RE NOT PATHOLOGICAL LIARS,

00:09:23.595 --> 00:09:28.000
BUT THIS PRESIDENT, HONESTLY, IN
MY VIEW, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:30.936 align:start position:0%
CONSTITUTION, DOES NOT RESPECT
THE RULE OF LAW, IS NOT

00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:33.906 align:start position:0%
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN
DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES, AND THAT

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:39.144
IS WHY I CONSIDER HIM TO BE THE
MOST DANGEROUS PRESIDENT IN THE

00:09:39.177 --> 00:09:45.684 align:start position:0%
MODERN HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY,
AND I INTEND TO DEFEAT THIS

00:09:45.717 --> 00:09:46.785 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT.

00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:48.053 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF YOU DO -- LET'S

00:09:48.086 --> 00:09:55.461
SAY YOU DO, SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS
PRESENT EXCHANGE IS OVER, OTHERS

00:09:55.494 --> 00:10:00.566 align:start position:0%
SAY IRAN IS GOING TO TAKE THEIR
TIME AND COULD BE MONTHS OR

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:01.634 align:start position:0%
YEARS DOWN THE LINE.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:08.007 align:start position:0%
IF YOU DO WIN, HOW DOES
PRESIDENT SANDERS RESPOND TO

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.511
IRANIAN AGGRESSION, THE BOMBING
OF OIL FIELDS IN SAUDI ARABIA,

00:10:12.544 --> 00:10:16.749 align:start position:0%
SPONSORING OF TERROR, HEZBOLLAH,
WHAT DO YOU DO IN RESPONSE TO

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:17.950 align:start position:0%
THAT?

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.552
&gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT WE DO, WHAT
WE DO IS UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A

00:10:20.585 --> 00:10:23.789
VERY VOLATILE REGION, THAT, FOR
MANY, MANY YEARS, THE UNITED

00:10:23.822 --> 00:10:28.594 align:start position:0%
STATES HAS SIDED WITH
SAUDI ARABIA, LED BY MOHAMMED

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:32.531 align:start position:0%
BIN SALMAN WHO IS A MURDERER AND
A DEMAGOGUE.

00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:33.632 align:start position:0%
HE IS OUR ALLY.

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:37.336 align:start position:0%
I THINK WHAT WE DO IS USE OUR
DIPLOMATIC POWER AND OUR

00:10:37.369 --> 00:10:39.538 align:start position:0%
RESOURCES TO DEMAND THESE
PEOPLE, WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR

00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.241 align:start position:0%
NOT, ARE GOING TO SIT IN A ROOM
AND THEY'RE GOING TO START

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:45.411 align:start position:0%
WORKING OUT THE DIFFERENCES THEY
HAVE BECAUSE I THINK THE

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:49.815
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF
GETTING SUCKED INTO WARS THAT

00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:52.584 align:start position:0%
ARE A RESULT OF THEIR
DIFFERENCES.

00:10:52.617 --> 00:10:54.820 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BUT THE
DIFFERENCES ARE JUST NOT

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:57.289 align:start position:0%
POLITICAL DIFFERENCES, THEY'RE
ALSO RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES

00:10:57.322 --> 00:11:00.959
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES IS
TAKE SIDES NOW IN A SUNNI-SHIA

00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:04.129 align:start position:0%
DIVIDE THAT HAS GONE ON FOR
YEARS.

00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:07.032 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE BEEN THE ALLIES OF
SAUDI ARABIA SINCE WAY BACK WHEN

00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:10.235 align:start position:0%
AND I THINK THE PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND THE LEADERSHIP OF

00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:16.375 align:start position:0%
SAUDI ARABIA MURDERED JOURNALIST
JAMAL KHASHOGGI, CUT HIM UP.

00:11:16.408 --> 00:11:20.913 align:start position:0%
THEY WILL CRUSH ANYBODY WHO
FIGHTS DEMOCRACY FOR

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:22.114 align:start position:0%
SAUDI ARABIA, INCLUDES WOMEN WHO
ARE THIRD-CLASS CITIZENS.

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:25.784 align:start position:0%
I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANY OF THIS
STUFF IS EASY, IT IS NOT.

00:11:25.817 --> 00:11:29.955 align:start position:0%
BUT WE'VE GOT TO USE OUR
DIPLOMATIC POWER, OUR FINANCIAL

00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:35.327 align:start position:0%
CARROTS AND STICKS TO GET PEOPLE
TOGETHER, NOT ONLY BETWEEN

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.098
SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN, BUT THE
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS, GET

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:43.602
PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND THE WORLD
WHO ARE IN CONFLICT AND SEE WHAT

00:11:43.635 --> 00:11:45.804 align:start position:0%
ROLE WE CAN PLAY IN TRYING TO
AVOID WAR.

00:11:45.837 --> 00:11:48.907 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR BAR
FOR MILITARY ACTION?

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; LOOK, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE
MAY WELL USE.

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:57.549
WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY IN
THE WORLD, AND THERE ARE TIMES

00:11:57.582 --> 00:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
WHEN WE MAY WELL HAVE TO USE
THAT MILITARY.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:04.289 size:84% position:42%
BUT I BELIEVE THAT MILITARY
ACTION SHOULD BE THE LAST

00:12:04.322 --> 00:12:06.892 align:start position:0%
RESPONSE, NOT THE FIRST
RESPONSE.

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:09.394 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SENATOR, WE HAVE

00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:10.562 align:start position:0%
TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:12.798
IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND, YOU
STICK AROUND BECAUSE WE'LL BE

00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:14.900 align:start position:0%
RIGHT BACK WITH MORE SENATOR
BENDERS, EVERYBODY.
