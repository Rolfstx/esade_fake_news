00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.890
 one million 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.979
 darker 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.979
 is like a lot 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.599
 Talking about your financial future from those figures has become the applet to all of you 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.489
 not sleeping 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.539
 caught at 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.239
 uh ... I'd like to start 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.150
 uh ... identify by a problem for you 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.329
 and so I'm just going to talk for a few minutes to two and a Q because right 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.800
 what we want to talk about is losing your wife, but I want to think about 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.330
 this for just a second 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.740
 As if we walked out of here today 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.850
 I said I'd buy 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.060
 ten percent of your financial future 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.390
 I'm going to write you a check today 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.430
 of the state forest 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 you are going to give me ten percent of everything you give her 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.320
 uh ... how much will you charge for that 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.990
 change one-tenth of you 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.840
 and uh ... I can take it a bit by the way 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 be careful what you are 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.000
 everything right now 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.580
 Well, I think it has a lot about that logic 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.310
 COP like that for a few let's see how you're going to go for me today 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.660
 in a lot to do with the money, but 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.050
 of the state for if you give me 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.410
 ten percent of what you were 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.509
 I think it would be very stupid 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.460
 of you 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.290
 any of you 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.820
 if you ask for less than say fifty thousand dollars out of the few years 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.070
 before going out 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.000
 make money in so I have a few years of money there, but then I would 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.530
 begins his royal yacht 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.850
 visual alongside so 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.290
 I really think that 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.770
 If you thought about it 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.090
 most of you will 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.760
 for a lot more I think you want to be right 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.799
 uh ... Fortunately I didn't make the deal with anyone When I started, so 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.650
 I'm no one a ten percent is generous but can 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.690
 uh ... I think that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.200
 fifty thousand what kind of the absolute minimum 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.370
 and if you think about that 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.220
 it means the law today 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.430
 you are worth five hundred thousand 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.810
 because of ten percent is worth fifty thousand in cash today 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.730
 your potential 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.729
 is worth a minimum of one hundred percent faces 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.999
 a five hundred thousand dollars which is the great financial asset you have it 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.329
 way more important 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:22.949
 what you do with that five hundred thousand dollar asset that you already have today 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:27.039
 whether you decide to buy shares or bonds or whether you put your money in a 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.309
 mutual fund or choose your own shares or anything of the kind 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.759
 the largest financial asset 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.959
 what you go for you through the miles 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.149
 is the value of your own income power over the years 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.919
 so that's really what you need to focus on what you focus on your financials 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.019
 full future 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.169
 This means that you need to focus on you 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.980
 for whether your ten percent is worth fifty thousand or a hundred 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.359
 thousand three hundred thousand 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.569
 that would be a five hundred thousand millionaire three million for all of you 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.959
 or it turns out that one of the others is really dependent 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.939
 I have a very big part of what you do in the next few years 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.159
 all of you in this room 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.439
 has the brain doing extremely well in life 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.939
 You already have the energy to do very well in life 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.199
 and the question is how do you do it 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.559
 If you have a two hundred horsepower car 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.649
 you two hundred or spa Robert 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.099
 you your full 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.619
 potential or you get a hundred or spa our fifty horsepower 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.839
 now there are two things that happen 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.789
 hold you back 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.760
 and about 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.399
 forcing power out of here 

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.819
 your engine whatever it may be all of you have the disputes 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.289
 at one of those the lack of education, but that probably isn't going to happen 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.059
 trump many people 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.809
 If you do not have a lack of education it does not if you do not have a chance to 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.599
 get a decent education life 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.469
 would make a difference that it was potential because 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.109
 you ever block 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.569
 but the second most important thing 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.639
 and just as important 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.539
 is in terms of the habits you develop in terms of what you do with 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.139
 yourself 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.379
 a week 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.719
 hire people 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.889
 we look for three qualities 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.459
 we look for integrity 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.029
 we look for intelligence 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.919
 and we look for energy 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.759
 But they do not have the first one that has integrity will kill the other two 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.189
 because if you hire someone without integrity he really wants to be 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.980
 done and lazy Gotcha great 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.979
 blasting the world you will not want to show your energetic self 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.129
 smart energetic net goals 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.569
 with integrity 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.020
 But I say well 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.149
 you make your own decision on what you can change 

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:33.939
 your i_q_ or how far you control the soccer player how high you can jump 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.919
 of the color of your hair very easily 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.539
 but you can 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.080
 choose 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.830
 integrity that matches someone else's to have and if you fit that 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.499
 with intelligence you have 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.440
 and energy you have 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.330
 uh ... you get an extraordinary lead you too many fools 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.749
 someone ten percent of yourself for fifty thousand on the other 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:55.129
 If you don't fit it without your potential 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.599
 in an important part 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.139
 and I'll give you a little 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.949
 apply simple test in terms of thinking about the kinda habit she wanted over 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.380
 If you don't have what you want to get you can be 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.780
 it can be lazy which can be fast you can be it 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.569
 lets be honest you can cut corners of the uh ... cops 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.039
 and make the resources for you 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.229
 no one else is going to make room for you 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.490
 and I suggest you play this little game with me too 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.860
 Think about the person you want to be in life 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.050
 serve is one of your contemporaries Maybe someone will orbit the 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.779
 person you admire most person you change places with if you could 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.409
 and then write down what you Martin 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.289
 just put it on a piece of paper 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.119
 Find out the person you want 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:44.849
 least like change places with what really turns you off 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.909
 when you find repulsive 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.159
 and give the reasons why 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.800
 that person you turn off so much 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.280
 to put those on the other side of the paper 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.249
 and then look at the list 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.099
 and you will find all that on the left that is in me and 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.590
 other people 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.249
 the qualities that bring them to life 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:04.729
 truth 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.979
 generosity of all kinds of things 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.039
 the finals of the things you can do to do it yourself is very simple 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.069
 did not fit yourself, but formed the custom shoe and do early on a military 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:15.659
 through life 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.550
 and on the other hand you will find that 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.699
 the things that repel people 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.379
 selfishness OB harmful use all these things selfishness 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.820
 things 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.120
 But nobody has to have it if you do it yourself you can get rid of them as well 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.330
 good to get rid of them early so that 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.030
 All I'm suggesting is that you're right 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.419
 the right to list what 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.860
 which admires 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.240
 what you find uh ... 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.830
 despicable 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.189
 and decide that in other people on the left 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.279
 I mean 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.809
 Add and admire everyone's saying you're going to buy for yourself as you do 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.949
 that when you're young and unlike the rest of your life it doesn't work 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.129
 If you do when you are fifty or sixty 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.999
 By then they will have a journey to well-formed 

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.080
 uh ... But if you do it early 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.090
 behavior becomes a habit so that 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.089
 If you do 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.249
 two or three years to go after the same exercise 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.179
 You will find out the person you admire most like yourself 

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:10.159
 I may have a little pockets under certain circumstances, but this 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.490
 uh ... but that's not it is a bad thing and what you want someone to be like 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.789
 and you don't want to be someone that you dislike and and uh ... 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.979
 Formal habits early 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.030
 uh ... he basically can't mess up I will give you another little piece of advice 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.169
 just a result of this 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.299
 and then we will get your questions in 

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:31.270
 and it is 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.310
 as a general business is a piece of specific finance 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.669
 uh ... financial advice 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:37.860
 I would say 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.840
 on board credit cards just forget about me 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.199
 uh ... where in several businesses issue credit card the American public loves 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:47.240
 credit cards, but if you start turning debt on credit card you are going to be 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.499
 pay 

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:51.259
 uh ... eighteen or twenty percent and 

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:53.180
 you can't make it 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.330
 progress and your financial life 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.449
 who lend on money eighteen or twenty percent 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:01.159
 You can make a lot of money by borrowing earlier eighteen or twenty percent 

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:03.009
 over time 

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:06.229
 You can find a way that is good that uh ... will borrow from you, however 

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:08.949
 you do not want on the side of the equation 

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.219
 it is always behind in life 

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:12.269
 uh ... 

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.249
 You know I was lucky I would be saved about ten thousand dollars by the time I got out 

00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:18.349
 school that was ten thousand dollars 

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:21.759
 Really worth millions I might later run on because after you get a family 

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.099
 member vaguely expenses roll in, however 

00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:27.349
 but these are my tools to work with, but that was just because I was in front of the 

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:28.210
 games 

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.620
 If you are behind a game by ten thousand dollars at some point in the payment of eighteen 

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.510
 or twenty percent interest on it 

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.710
 you will never economically you will never get out of that cell 

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.410
 their partner who says 

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.500
 I want to know is where I'm going to die so I'll never go there 

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.290
 events where international affairs as well as you want to find out where you are 

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.020
 do not want to be 

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.140
 uh ... at a time in a void I get about a dozen letters a day 

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.800
 of people with terrible problems 

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.620
 And there are two reasons why they have terrible problems 

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.060
 is one 

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.980
 A number of them have health problems of some sort and they really have 

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.770
 hit by someone or someone in their family was hit by some sort of 

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.220
 catastrophic 

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.860
 uh ... sickness and that's it 

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.470
 you know it's a terrible thing to happen to a family 

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.020
 and they get in 

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.900
 there are bills that they cannot pay and in fact only consult the community that one 

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.680
 in terms of protecting people against it, but it's just plain bad luck 

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.200
 the other one is from people running credit card debt and uh ... 

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.520
 they face bankruptcy as evidenced by bankruptcy once again 

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.480
 and they will of what your money and they can pay them the interest on the loan 

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.520
 pani principled 

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.449
 and half of my letters come from people like that and that 

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:39.940
 that problem is preventable 

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.880
 catastrophic diseases, however 

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.700
 credit card debt has something to bring on yourself and 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.510
 this is a better way 

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.610
 this is easier way 

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.070
 to stay out of trouble 

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.970
 than getting out of trouble financially and and uh ... 

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.470
 I will ensure that if you put in a great record you will be in trouble 

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.950
 probably the rest of your life in terms of 

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.860
 uh ... your financial situation on the other hand, if you're ahead of the game 

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.980
 uh ... 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.200
 even if on a very modest scale 

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.160
 money comes in to invest 

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.600
 mandira that you a 

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.419
 you b 

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:15.420
 people owe you money or shares Oyu ownership 

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.970
 and you will be way ahead of the game compared to paying it uh ... 

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.529
 It has always been their pay 

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:22.830
 your creditors every month 

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.940
 my advice to you this sir 

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.670
 if you can't pay for it don't buy 

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.730
 put it yourself in a position where you can pay for everything and uh ... 

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.520
 then we will be glad to see abortion in the rest of the furniture market 

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.070
 Now let's uh ... 

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.790
 let's ask some questions 

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.000
 We have a mic out there that 

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.400
 people can either go in the direction of the journey around her 

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.630
 And I can't necessarily situate well fed 

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.590
 I think one can touch any size in just raising your hand waitress to come 

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.670
 to you 

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:58.030
 We have some electronics like mine 

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.440
 ask anything about your mind about them 

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.250
 Gottlieb real 

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.320
 how can you people who are innocent 

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.980
 and make curriculum and a pen 

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.370
 me keeping families in my non-standard 

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.350
 Furman it that uh ... performing arts center 

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.290
 Music 

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.350
 What advice would you give to 

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.060
 please 

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.610
 out of financial weakness in the world 

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.350
 but Syrup 

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.710
 that our market system 

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.330
 uh ... 

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.030
 It doesn't pay as well in some and spend some activities as 

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.910
 seems appropriate 

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.900
 for the importance of the activities of society 

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.070
 just a tuition for example on the tuition does not pay well 

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.250
 What could be more important I mean you know you have to be 

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.160
 if interested in what you too 

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.490
 Your children's teachers are scheduling your account desert and up 

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.680
 uh ... everything 

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.380
 Firms win the heavyweight title of the world of that sort of thing, though 

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.710
 it it does not work well paid and and 

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.050
 it is a fundamental choice 

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.450
 uh ... what you are about to go into something that it can be for many people 

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.470
 the definable choice of where to go in something you love, or 

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.550
 something then 

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.770
 to try to make a lot of money I think 

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.940
 generally it is worth going with what you love 

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.180
 uh ... I think that 

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.390
 it is very difficult to find people 

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.240
 when they are my age 

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.269
 say they are up 

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:29.950
 that they love what they have done their whole life and feel worth it 

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.590
 uh ... but they are terribly sad they made that choice because they didn't have a 

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.260
 a lot of money i idon't think anyone ever 

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.630
 ever said that to me that they wish they wanted away in something else for this 

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.900
 or do uncomfortable under did not enjoy it does not feel very productive, however 

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.170
 make a lot of money 

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.310
 so I don't think you will find 

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.050
 that's why i would never go to work 

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.610
 I would go to work 

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.270
 and any terms your honor 

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.560
 it can turn out to be more profitable than and you can but thank you 

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.390
 almost everyone here will make 

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.480
 enough money 

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.150
 unless they get some terrible habits along the way 

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.350
 to do reasonably well and to do reasonably well in this country 

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.840
 really 

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.560
 is uh ... is pretty darn good I mean activities 

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.750
 it is not necessary 

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.320
 uh ... big sums of money are in order and your ears I enjoy myself when I do 

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:16.859
 was not 

00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:18.520
 and my ten thousand dollars 

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.740
 I live in the same house I lived in when I was busy when I was over 

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.720
 that I bought forty-one years ago 

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.350
 I would love the house and I love the house now 

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.120
 If you think about it 

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.410
 If you do a reasonable job 

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.159
 you will eat at McDonalds, and I will be there top so our word approach 

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:37.070
 uh ... on on food I mean 

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.910
 help in the fact that I was very clear actually in Baghdad 

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.710
 uh ... I think on the Dairy Queen you will see me and you can order read on the 

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.340
 menu I can order we will both be able to afford it 

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.590
 you know you old he wears the same clothes I wear I will pay more for me 

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.750
 fit, but is not good for the money looks cheap on me so will talk about the good 

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.200
 the same event 

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.280
 will both live in the same houses I live in the house of forty-one years ago 

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.500
 that's it it's hot in the winter and a school in the summer and it's comfortable 

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.730
 and you live in a house that was somewhere in that 

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.450
 only the is a negative you fifty more rooms orbital guesthouses let down 

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.620
 encourage Brenda problems I mean you have to worry about that 

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.630
 about the uh ... greens keeper something when you get through his 

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.550
 uh ... I was in the house the people 

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.530
 uh ... where the house is a job uh ... 

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.930
 probably two hundred times 

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.740
 uh ... what is my home is worth and i would not submit any heparin dose homes at all 

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.710
 I could I do not want to be so happy I only have one thing not to worry about and 

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.980
 you know there 

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.220
 dozens of people all over the place and 

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.000
 people stop into people stealing from him kinds of these 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.980
 helicopter 

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.460
 Our drive will be the same kind of car thanks probably a better car I would drive 

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.300
 record about eight years old I don't know what it's worth right now 

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.060
 It took me about five and that I'm very happy to watch 

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.150
 whats the same television you know 

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.870
 will work pretty well on the same computer 

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.770
 The only difference will be 

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.720
 how we long distances 

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.270
 fly a plane that 

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.760
 more comfortable in 

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.320
 when does South West Airlines fly or something against etc. 

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.770
 I have nothing against Babbitt that's the one really big difference and 

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.780
 other than doing what i love every day i hope you know what you want 

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.359
 every day and uh ... 

00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:20.860
 I work with nice people I hope you work with nice people 

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.220
 and that's the twenty-four hours of the day and that's where the hours ago or 

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.120
 so 

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.260
 great wealth 

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.800
 uh ... 

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.230
 just slightly different 

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.530
 uh ... in a real stp sense than just a decent one 

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.550
 a decent income and uh ... 

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.960
 a trade 

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.060
 a decent income 

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.410
 and something you love in something you feel worthwhile 

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.960
 to do it 

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.590
 great stuff for you to trade off a lot of your principles 

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:58.460
 I would be a terrible mistake 

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:04.210
 Reviewing that acknowledged success is more about helping yourself learn from others 

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.070
 Well, I did 

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.259
 I got the pipe 

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:08.360
 which was very happy in life 

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.270
 uh ... If you tell me what your heroes are uh ... I will 

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.530
 make a good prediction on how 

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.080
 what you are going to do and IIII have the right heroes I was very happy in 

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.330
 life and uh ... 

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.440
 my heroes never let me down and started with my dad 

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.980
 and then I have others in business and 

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.750
 so i have 

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.050
 great teachers 

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.570
 a formal teachers some that just 

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.600
 informal teachers teachers by instinct for example 

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.030
 and uh ... 

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.140
 If I didn't have those 

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.030
 uh ... 

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.970
 you know mike my life insurer would have been very different if i was born any 

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.670
 place else when i was born in 1930 

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.670
 uh ... and 

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.920
 in time 

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.260
 one out of fifty bars in the world a united states so i came up against 

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.430
 50-1 chance of birth denied state 

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.880
 I probably would have been a disaster you know if I was born in Afghanistan 

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.010
 or Peru or a place and that i 

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.140
 Four-to-one-i won the lottery Today I was born you know by born in this 

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.850
 land so you all 

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.830
 uh ... I mean you have you 

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.360
 the odds were probably 14-1 against you being born in this country 

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.150
 and uh ... the roots 

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.280
 five times probably born in 

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.690
 the insurance of their six times as 

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.180
 four five times more likely to be born in 

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.180
 and in India or some other place where would not have been easy 

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.459
 to exploit them 

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:31.870
 for potential account, so we won the lottery in that respect 

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.420
 and it's just plain luck 

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.770
 I mean uh ... 

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.310
 and I was lucky to be born at this time and the capital budget 

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.550
 is something 

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.710
 it pays off very well in society now 

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.820
 But that doesn't mean paying off in other societies in that 

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.200
 did not pay off you know many years ago my friend, but Bill Gates says that if I do 

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.230
 would have been born a few thousand years ago i was a few animals 

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.470
 pilot 

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.390
 I can't run very fast I can't climb trees and you know I just happened 

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.650
 it's talented no one asked me to climb trees now but uh ... 

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.900
 There was a time when I could get out of an important can 

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.850
 By the way bill would have been some animal breakfast and he may not be so fast 

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.010
 leader, though 

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.210
 India uh ... 

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.480
 that we are happy 

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.779
 we think only part of a hundred years ago exactly the same talents and 

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:18.510
 how far they think of that 

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.750
 of the average person the sheriff so much better than that 

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.380
 the richest person would 

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.130
 uh ... a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago cell 

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.340
 uh ... 

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.780
 Morgan at respective happy 

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.860
 one of the great parents 

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.660
 I was lucky to make them back online I think in a big public school 

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.640
 system I need to start here 

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.630
 in the first eight degrees 

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.269
 they have a foundation for me 

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:43.800
 which later, when I got off the track a few times 

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.010
 uh ... He got me through because I have a tremendous high school education 

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.660
 in to author analogous Roselle and one of the reasons 

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.780
 I havent been kind of sorry by the way, but I have a great education 

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.410
 uh ... in part 

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.380
 because 

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.140
 women were around 

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.000
 strongly discriminated against and sold by that time 

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.460
 could be a teacher she could be a secretary she could be a nurse 

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.670
 you know and i was about a reality and i have to tell what draws in united 

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.010
 state 

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.530
 limited to just a few posts so you had plenty of talent 

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.860
 uh ... in that 

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.770
 activities such as nursing her after her teaching because 

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.090
 uh ... a talent 

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.299
 with men are scattered about 

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:27.309
 every act every formal work activity there was none with women it was 

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:29.570
 concentrated in a few areas and that 

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.860
 uh ... for the benefit of it it's kind of sad because they have the benefit 

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.950
 teachers, however 

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.440
 But I was very happy 

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.230
 really got that way 

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.870
 uh ... my whole life and 

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.410
 what I do 

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.210
 what I do is important is that what it would be pure governors do or 

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.320
 something of the species 

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.419
 and ii think it is very questionable 

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:51.919
 it pays off extremely well in a market economy like the United States and uh ... 

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.400
 but it is an accident 

00:19:53.400 --> 00:20:00.400
 demand an innate ability of mine 

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.970
 underscores its marine this is an anti ten omaha central high school a place for 

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.320
 you 

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.130
 one institution chemistry buffet technology is agreed land and 

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.750
 stimulation of the world economy which are your predictions for the future of out 

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:20.960
 of the IT industry and white was a teacher role in the world economy 

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.500
 the United States on the download said there is no doubt in the world 

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.370
 upside down that's it it's done it a ton 

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.820
 already, but 

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.980
 it will be as I was just beginning 

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.080
 but is moving very fast 

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.490
 I met gates on July fifteenth 1991 there for a fourth of it 

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.670
 Julie 

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.970
 uh ... 

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.470
 celebration with a friend 

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.040
 and uh ... 

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.179
 who subsequently died Meg GREENFIELD of the Washington Post and she left us in the lurch 

00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:49.270
 to those of the gates family 

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.210
 he tried to feed me 

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.160
 and he also has a better chance with chimpanzees I mean II was there so there 

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.650
 really a disaster, though 

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.130
 but it is a good teacher 

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.690
 but one thing he did tell me was that 

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.100
 at the time, he said 

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.470
 you know you have this model in your head of the world 

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.549
 and your model 

00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:10.440
 time and distance 

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.650
 if many factors are limiting and he said they are limiting factors more 

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.950
 admissibility 

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.640
 food 

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.990
 Talk to someone all over the world or put your message in front of 

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.490
 someone or publication 

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.810
 is that it is going to be zero and parcel post a zero does not make a difference 

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.520
 in 

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.150
 you know what revolutionary 

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.909
 it has already happened in a in a very very big way and 

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:34.170
 it's just uh ... what eight years later 

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.760
 and and that's it that's how it exploded 

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.140
 high technology 

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.730
 information technology where we want to call it 

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.790
 is busy around the world 

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.400
 and that's going to change that and ah ... 

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.600
 very, very big way that I would change and that's one of the things I think about a 

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.130
 businesses we buy 

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.260
 uh ... We announce yesterday's purchase 

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.480
 uh ... door uh ... furniture dealer and and and and Boston in the Boston area 

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.720
 you know I think to myself what the effect of this new world is in terms of the 

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.240
 internet on furniture repairer we have to think about questions like that 

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.410
 that the changes will be huge i will be played bridge yesterday 

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.350
 uh ... with people 

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.500
 uh ... across the country, but I have it with people of the world logistics 

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.960
 on my computer and I have some popcorn ironman khaki and a sweater and 

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.580
 i 

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.220
 I can have a bridge game in thirty seconds with people all over the world 

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:22.970
 in 

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.540
 uh ... no charge for basically adding 

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.280
 Now that's a lot different than trying to arrange a game before people become a mum 

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.180
 Anton peddles embracing a man wants to play golf mom wants to watch baseball 

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.410
 and his 

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.710
 it's just that it changes things in a big way 

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.570
 we are very happy i mean it is 

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.160
 indeed agreed what the United States leads to the world in this area means we 

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.659
 has an edge 

00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:49.070
 it's hard to think of what's in the second place 

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.250
 and fifteen years or so ago 

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.050
 this country has an inferiority complex would be difficult for you to remember to 

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.690
 shoot you were not yet old enough to be around them, but in the early 

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.970
 eighties 

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.320
 We wondered if the Germans and Japanese were going for everything 

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.800
 and if they were going to make all the steel when they were going to make them all 

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.950
 the cars 

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.420
 and everything else and the TV sets 

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.480
 and we're flip burgers now that was the standard line 

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.320
 and 

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.250
 just think for a short period of like fifteen years I was changed around 

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.010
 in an important way that Shane because 

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.040
 information 

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.720
 a revolution uh ... where we had to 

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.970
 like i said i don't know who 

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.690
 I don't know what you would call is second in the world, but here's 

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.830
 the most important industry in the world 

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.580
 and the United States has this incredible position 

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.510
 and removing all the time from the position so 

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.100
 I think that 

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.540
 argue for a lot 

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.930
 I think it argues for trivia future for the world over time and I think so 

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:49.360
 argue even more for a wonderful future with this company our country 

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.880
 one of the best place for you to start now in securing their financials 

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.090
 future 

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.220
 uh ... for forgetting to secure their financial future 

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.880
 freely youthful 

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.890
 well it is not 

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.809
 it's a very complicated uh ... 

00:24:02.809 --> 00:24:05.270
 it goes back to 

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.430
 To make full use of your own talents first 

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.690
 I mean, there are twins or you are going to earn extra two extracts 

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.350
 respond here to see 

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.779
 uh ... twenty years from now 

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.500
 goes a function 

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.720
 some time good how much talent you have, but I will how good you the talent you have 

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.180
 already 

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.200
 and uh ... 

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.360
 approximately 

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.860
 your best financial future 

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.320
 is your own ability 

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.780
 and one 

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.090
 and here 

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.860
 uh ... capacity too 

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.860
 to use those abilities to their potential 

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.870
 and 

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.539
 They can take what can be taken away from the Kerry Kerrigan tax 

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:45.539
 I mean that 

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:46.740
 you know most things 

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.470
 if you don't as a hobby Serena said they double the tax as double 

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.210
 the tax that changes 

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.260
 your ownership of the property, because now 

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.710
 In effect, the tax authorities are becoming more and more over, because they have 

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.010
 gotta greater command on the revenue stream 

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.640
 uh ... send about 

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.260
 uh ... almost any assets you have uh ... 

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.130
 Big ones and they don't tax what's in your head 

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.580
 and they do not act 

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.029
 here, but what we did 

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:13.310
 start performing when you get to work in the morning and 

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.580
 ending in the evening uh ... your potential to be one of the things that astounds me 

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:22.600
 is how people who really well just kind of jump out at your feed want a 

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.429
 running a business when I left school 

00:25:25.429 --> 00:25:26.290
 you all know 

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.240
 want that way of acting, but they don't do most people 

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.680
 going to sleep through life and 

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.050
 added if you don't 

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.010
 you will stand out like that 

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.610
 the big the biggest thing for your financial futures yourself now 

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.080
 further that it is always before the game rather than behind the 

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.520
 game it saves a little no matter how you do it i mean i papers i 

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.820
 worked at pennies and sold well pulling from a pinball machine i got a lot 

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.930
 things 

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.360
 which enabled me to gmail in about ten thousand dollars by the time I got out 

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.490
 school 

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.960
 uh ... 

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.710
 ten thousand are just going to die for now 

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.090
 for something 

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.390
 so that your head of the game and not get behind the game 

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.600
 very important is I just mean 

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.470
 you know when you go to a hundred 

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.680
 and bond against a lot of people in life 

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.660
 uh ... if you can't work it out so that when the gun goes off your ten or 

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.340
 fifteen meters ahead 

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.000
 instead of ten or fifteen yards behind is going to make a big difference 

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.559
 in how the breed comes out like this 

00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:25.880
 after having some net 

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.340
 resources 

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.770
 leave the member service or in stocks or bonds in my eye ... 

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.820
 uh ... and not with guilt 

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.610
 when i did it goes down when you get out of school 

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:41.390
 uh ... is a big crossover to get behind the game and uh ... 

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.460
 it can come from DOLORES paper in the morning from can come from part time 

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.570
 works somewhere, though 

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.380
 set aside a few dollars for yourself that uh ... 

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.120
 uh ... so 

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.070
 when the time comes in the other 

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.970
 more of the workforce uh ... 

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.900
 your head of the game and not behind and then when you get there behind 

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.980
 by buying a lot of things that 

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.960
 If you go to pay for Sunday you pay twenty percent interest in 

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.410
 in between 

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.740
 since BT please stay in Maine and school let me ask your questions 

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:15.740
 that they miss him on the market, but I think 

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.030
 my name is Patrick Burland 

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.470
 Plymouth right 

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.250
 I wondered with the increasing 

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.340
 hahahha 

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.659
 education today 

00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:29.330
 welcome to thank students for dealing with this is one surviving college 

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.910
 Well, I think it's a hard line and and and I decide that office is going I could 

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.480
 and I will encourage you, and others if possible and 

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.940
 and uh ... 

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.540
 uh ... before that time came out I would say this 

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.980
 uh ... 

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.160
 in my experience 

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.240
 in business 

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.030
 there is very little difference 

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.150
 if any 

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.160
 between a very high priced business training 

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.390
 and what is available in a lot for a lot less money so ii means iam 

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.410
 I went to college to stay up to date with the Lincoln 

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.170
 Last year in college I had to work for a few years before that ... 

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.110
 uh ... 

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.790
 I learned as much as college breast as I did at the Wharton at uh ... 

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.299
 uh ... and 

00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:17.160
 It is nothing against Warner measures that we have a very good school he writes 

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.150
 and great professors living at the Lincoln 

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.630
 so II will not accept 

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.830
 that if I pay a few thousand dollars for an education system 

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.200
 uh ... here in the state for example 

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.520
 purses pain 

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.270
 large amounts of the swear 

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.110
 that it's going to make a big difference uh ... 

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.410
 uh ... most of the a lot of education 

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.030
 uh ... unity you need to be pushed in the right direction an awful lot of it 

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.300
 self 

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.440
 the self-taught 

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.830
 my Andrew Carnegie a wonderful thing in this country in terms of libraries and 

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.630
 you spend a lot of time 

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.360
 lovers and have frozen in at the university will not want the then 

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.320
 the University of mother on the head 

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.690
 I couldn't get out for hours and uh ... midnight I get so in tune with what I am 

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.720
 was to read, though 

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.629
 there are all kinds of information available now the internet is so much 

00:29:04.629 --> 00:29:07.490
 you know question what was then 

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.470
 it must be taken out there 

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.570
 there is no need to pay 

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.730
 thirty or thirty-five O three dollars a year ago to a 

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.730
 uh ... big names school 

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.100
 education at all 

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.150
 If you are not alone, then account for it most importantly 

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.760
 of course you are in business 

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.929
 going to tell not responsible absolutely as well 

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:30.000
 and my eye you will I go 

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.540
 Garber I mean ii see uh ... 

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:37.710
 I would I would Abed on that and uh ... 

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.120
 I wouldn't grow up 

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.050
 large accounts 

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.540
 Interviews with a business training from you know if you want to get a medical 

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.990
 education 

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.460
 I mean, there are certain professions 

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.190
 not a way to 

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.980
 Spend a fair amount of money and get into debt to some extent 

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.010
 is going to make that decision yourself, but definitely try to reduce it 

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.350
 and uh ... 

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.160
 uh ... and i was kind of i would have thought out 

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.080
 how i would 

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.490
 Campbell that debt 

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.270
 and say a period of five years after I left school where I would think twice 

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.970
 Going on 

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.789
 there is a question here if we can bring a microphone 

00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:17.649
 uh ... managed Hong Kong here every few minutes advisory council 

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:22.000
 uh ... what advice would you have for forming a non-profit organization 

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.470
 executing a non-profit organization 

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:30.370
 always try to avoid forming a non-profit organization 

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.620
 well II want to bet will depend entirely on what a lot wanted to accomplish I mean 

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.230
 uh ... you know it could be one there was a hospital and another thing 

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.830
 uh ... that over 

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.750
 visitors and are so many kinds of it so i 

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.789
 you know you have people to get 

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:46.400
 better experienced in involved 

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.670
 uh ... 

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.110
 internet idea like that and uh ... 

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.460
 uh ... but uh ... the defense so much on that 

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.280
 on the objectivity 

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:59.330
 you work up 

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.870
 off promises shown here 

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.620
 microphone for a long time 

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.950
 I mean carhartt right Nine West high school 

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.410
 and engineer very soon involved a plane hindered he thought 

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.230
 it's very individual and my head 

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.000
 you know I wouldn't say I don't and II do certain topic and I guess 

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.389
 think 

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:24.330
 Europe your model as a citizen for example and all the walrus god and he 

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.070
 is 

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.790
 much more so that was involved 

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.559
 but I am and uh ... 

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:31.779
 incident its predecessor Peter had it too but heaters brought it to new 

00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:33.130
 heights so i 

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.810
 uh ... I don't want to 

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.510
 uh ... on any mammal for that myself I do some things uh ... 

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.860
 uh ... 

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.419
 One of the problems I love that I don't do so much is that uh ... 

00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:46.710
 who wants to kind of take the reins over and I'm like a 

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.550
 uh ... man who likes to play a lot offers some things that i like 

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.190
 the business I'm in 

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.169
 uh ... I have a family 

00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:56.280
 district very active uh ... 

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.220
 uh ... some of my kids were 

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.210
 worked 

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.390
 almost anything that comes together in the civic area and 

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.590
 you know it is 

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.140
 you do 

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.920
 and and people do what they want to meet the criteria big and and uh ... 

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.400
 uh ... 

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.490
 I've never spoken to anyone who 

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:17.920
 who enjoys being in the civil activities that India is very worthwhile 

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.230
 after doing something to build and 

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.770
 participate in building something always 

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:27.120
 on the right track and acting head of time we have a golf tournament for example 

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.290
 September and 

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:32.340
 We raise money for seventy drinks a good time to no one pay any price 

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.650
 by doing this I have a good time coming and people are having a good time 

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.500
 And then we have almost two people to show 

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.929
 You have to be enjoying things that you go on and you will want to work in the civilian 

00:32:42.929 --> 00:32:45.290
 activities that 

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.670
 but interesting that you do the same in politics 

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.380
 you know or if you 

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.810
 If you 

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.980
 If you find 

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.460
 political ideas drupal apart 

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.770
 or politicians in particular 

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:03.670
 you wonder if I really wouldn't take a lot of self satisfaction out 

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.750
 I work continue to do something worthwhile so i 

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:13.750
 just just follow your instinct on that uh ... their my recommendation 

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.790
 okay 

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:25.279
 Prime Minister regrets leaving the Ritz through school 

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:29.810
 I think the old beat youth of today and I wonder 

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.010
 what do you see is the problem facing the biggest economic problem 

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.750
 uh ... visa today goes into the future 

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.160
 now on 

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.610
 I don't think that uh ... 

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:44.650
 you are going to have enormous economic problems I think you will live in a 

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.510
 society 

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.650
 where the average person 

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.630
 uh ... live better 

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.530
 by a considerable margin 

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.309
 if the average one of the generation earlier is two generations earlier 

00:33:56.309 --> 00:34:00.200
 is the history of this country it is a wonderful country that way 

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.710
 if you really have a four and a half percent of the world's population 

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.070
 you know and and 

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.749
 what has been accomplished is an incredible 53 percent of them 

00:34:08.749 --> 00:34:13.529
 of the value of publicly traded companies in the world exists in 

00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:16.189
 the United States with four and a half percent of the population 

00:34:16.189 --> 00:34:18.039
 this country always 

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:20.069
 did well not uh ... 

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:21.869
 and they say in stocks 

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:25.089
 What you have to buy stock in the business is so good that even an idiot 

00:34:25.089 --> 00:34:25.989
 can run it 

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.799
 for sooner or later one good and and 

00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:32.039
 Those terrible board lessons have not been kind of used in this country 

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:34.149
 from time to time what I mean we have 

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:37.389
 We want all the problems that come along when you look back on the ice 

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.399
 hundred years and are all the problems this country is going to do 

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:43.729
 integrate a very long list into a lot of people who focus on the problems of 

00:34:43.729 --> 00:34:44.739
 the time 

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.240
 missed the bigger picture 

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.649
 and the bigger picture 

00:34:47.649 --> 00:34:50.639
 is that each generation was better than the one before 

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.649
 and it's because of uh ... 

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:54.019
 ice because of 

00:34:54.019 --> 00:34:56.859
 saving because they do not allow people to 

00:34:56.859 --> 00:35:00.709
 new tools create better things to do as they go as well 

00:35:00.709 --> 00:35:02.539
 because of an environment 

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:07.089
 with which people realize their potential to a greater extent than most others 

00:35:07.089 --> 00:35:10.920
 environments in the world it is far from perfect I mean it is it it is mature 

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.469
 partisan perfect 

00:35:12.469 --> 00:35:14.689
 but it's better than anything else 

00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:17.209
 around I mean in this country 

00:35:17.209 --> 00:35:18.529
 uh ... you have ' 

00:35:18.529 --> 00:35:21.969
 you do not have a commissioner run anything Haiti 

00:35:21.969 --> 00:35:25.170
 you know about a big business in this country you have a guy like Jack Welch " 

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.669
 and and a fellow like Jack Welch makes 

00:35:27.669 --> 00:35:30.149
 can be a difference of 

00:35:30.149 --> 00:35:33.869
 in terms of productivity of the enterprise over a period of decades and 

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:35.679
 productivity is everything 

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:38.799
 This is what causes the standard of living to rise to something like that 

00:35:38.799 --> 00:35:42.699
 A system that throws the Jack Welch is operating from world businesses 

00:35:42.699 --> 00:35:47.249
 is going to have an enormous advantage over society that does not have by inheritance 

00:35:47.249 --> 00:35:49.569
 or the do it by the government edict 

00:35:49.569 --> 00:35:50.899
 and we have ' 

00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:53.009
 we are closer to that society 

00:35:53.009 --> 00:35:57.399
 which I described in as if anything than any other country and it is 

00:35:57.399 --> 00:36:00.789
 his lead does great things and I will continue to redirect the big thing so that I 

00:36:00.789 --> 00:36:01.500
 think 

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.879
 I think you have the best future 

00:36:03.879 --> 00:36:06.889
 uh ... you know you're not facing a war 

00:36:06.889 --> 00:36:08.910
 and you have a view that you have a 

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.319
 a breather 

00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:12.129
 uh ... you got better 

00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:13.309
 uh ... 

00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:15.389
 future in terms of 

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:16.649
 uh ... 

00:36:16.649 --> 00:36:18.740
 achieving neutral rewards 

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.669
 if any 

00:36:19.669 --> 00:36:21.749
 generation in history so 

00:36:21.749 --> 00:36:24.569
 which encourages places 

00:36:24.569 --> 00:36:31.569
 When I dared to make it through the field no 

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:40.659
 do not 

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:44.119
 behind Wilkins for Millard West High School 

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:47.919
 I wondered if you or if you can't speak for Mister gates was scared 

00:36:47.919 --> 00:36:49.099
 van 

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:53.149
 The impact of white u_k_ on the economy was specifically the stock market bill 

00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:56.700
 and i'm glad you bring indigestion another day because i 

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.869
 I was last night in the world understanding that white too chaotic 

00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:01.979
 you know I don't know why these microphones don't work you know 

00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:03.869
 know why lights go on a 

00:37:03.869 --> 00:37:07.679
 I turn on the switch on my television and pray I mean I say it already is 

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:09.569
 it I though all is a bit 

00:37:09.569 --> 00:37:13.249
 I would say these are the smartest people I know in that area 

00:37:13.249 --> 00:37:15.029
 uh ... a great deal 

00:37:15.029 --> 00:37:18.469
 think it's a non-event now 

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:21.380
 in this country that I don't think speaks for the rest of the world, but 

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.209
 uh ... 

00:37:22.209 --> 00:37:24.639
 uh ... So I think uh ... 

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:26.759
 I think you will wake up 

00:37:26.759 --> 00:37:28.059
 January 

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:31.739
 first in fine the world does not change from December thirtieth 

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:34.449
 Now I want to say that maybe you can give a lot of friends a right to 

00:37:34.449 --> 00:37:37.969
 go for a billion dollars on December thirtieth and deposit them 

00:37:37.969 --> 00:37:41.520
 you know who knows what will happen can't lose something i mean like the reaction and 

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.710
 It is a system that fails up you know you can find a lot of money 

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.469
 your account, but I wouldn't count on it there 

00:37:47.469 --> 00:37:50.769
 where we had what we had without a college activity etc. 

00:37:50.769 --> 00:37:53.339
 we have about fourteen or five hundred 

00:37:53.339 --> 00:37:57.779
 uh ... customers on the pieces of planes with us and us, so we have a hundred 

00:37:57.779 --> 00:38:00.980
 we have a hundred and sixty their aircraft of some of our own flying around and 

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.119
 very interesting for me to see 

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:04.349
 what p 

00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:05.399
 promoted 

00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:08.059
 People on the cell at a time when they were using money it would be very serious 

00:38:08.059 --> 00:38:09.159
 a lot 

00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:10.359
 sign for 

00:38:10.359 --> 00:38:11.929
 January first st

 twelve oh a boat trader 

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:16.549
 it wouldn't bother me to fly Middle East 

00:38:16.549 --> 00:38:21.599
 on January first or anything else on January first 

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:25.439
 ideally i hope you get to aviator posters plane 

00:38:25.439 --> 00:38:30.139
 GameStop 

00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:32.079
 and Jeannie comfort from Clint bolick 

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:36.549
 went home and had a decidedly invested time and money and 

00:38:36.549 --> 00:38:40.929
 yellow wine 

00:38:40.929 --> 00:38:44.109
 Businesses that have good economics who now what a good economy will be good 

00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:46.259
 economy or business that 

00:38:46.259 --> 00:38:49.539
 kind of a shape around it 

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:53.509
 make his product or service look for a place or something 

00:38:53.509 --> 00:38:54.859
 a little more time 

00:38:54.859 --> 00:38:59.009
 unwanted in the customer than any other kind of comparable product 

00:38:59.009 --> 00:39:00.379
 uh ... 

00:39:00.379 --> 00:39:03.429
 you know what the number one candy bar has been in the last thirty or forty years 

00:39:03.429 --> 00:39:04.609
 Snickers 

00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:07.399
 People don't fool around with different candy bars 

00:39:07.399 --> 00:39:09.239
 they fool around with different ones 

00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:12.430
 length dresses so on the yellow all kinds of things, but they do not fool 

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.879
 around with candy bars 

00:39:13.879 --> 00:39:16.909
 because they thought we were going to lay down fifty cents or whatever his input 

00:39:16.909 --> 00:39:18.379
 their mouths and 

00:39:18.379 --> 00:39:21.019
 they are not going to run for fifty cents a farm in your mouth looking for 

00:39:21.019 --> 00:39:24.799
 herself of power of 1245 cents and put something else me 

00:39:24.799 --> 00:39:25.979
 I'm also a 

00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:28.019
 you find that very stable 

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:29.559
 and we want businesses 

00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:30.460
 what we think 

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.439
 we can figure out where they are going to be in ten or fifteen years 

00:39:33.439 --> 00:39:36.029
 I don't know where the information technology companies are going to be in 

00:39:36.029 --> 00:39:39.149
 ten or fifteen years idler Snickers bars are going to be in ten or fifteen years 

00:39:39.149 --> 00:39:41.550
 are just going to be sold over the spin in the way they do now 

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.849
 Don't worry, please glue in ten or fifteen years is not to be 

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:46.469
 a lot of innovation 

00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:48.389
 in in insurance of 

00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:51.819
 uh ... the ending internet football cause people to put them in a dominant position 

00:39:51.819 --> 00:39:52.959
 least 

00:39:52.959 --> 00:39:55.869
 makes me think so but i don't accept but uh ... 

00:39:55.869 --> 00:39:58.729
 OB 

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:01.269
 this is predictable 

00:40:01.269 --> 00:40:04.769
 regarding the sustainability of a competitive advantage some something 

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.169
 special proc 

00:40:06.169 --> 00:40:07.900
 so we look for these kinds of products 

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.549
 and then we have to look for the people 

00:40:09.549 --> 00:40:13.029
 but running the business which is honest 

00:40:13.029 --> 00:40:15.479
 on 

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.499
 clubs 

00:40:16.499 --> 00:40:19.530
 It is easier to find people hospitable because of the fine 

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.099
 businesses that 

00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:24.179
 just goes great for a long period of time 

00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:27.019
 there's a business and looks like a rock star doing amazing work 

00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:28.629
 really about Breyer over time 

00:40:28.629 --> 00:40:30.390
 but this is what we are looking for m 

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.510
 nice thing about it or not to find very many 

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.289
 we find one a year 

00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:36.739
 that's great 

00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:41.269
 You don't have to do a hundred thousand great investment ideas well 

00:40:41.269 --> 00:40:42.669
 you some 

00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:45.309
 and uh ... 

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:46.669
 the discipline 

00:40:46.669 --> 00:40:49.679
 is the most important thing Sharp brain power 

00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:51.639
 with Winnie discipline 

00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:55.049
 you don't need a hundred and fifty i_q_ to do what i do 

00:40:55.049 --> 00:40:57.819
 You know where you are not a hundred and forty you know they are needed in thirty 

00:40:57.819 --> 00:41:01.109
 five you may need a hundred and fifteen or something like that and 

00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:03.249
 and yet he disciplined him 

00:41:03.249 --> 00:41:04.649
 you have to wait 

00:41:04.649 --> 00:41:07.469
 until you see the fat field swinging up 

00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:11.069
 because investing is a noble called strike game you know up If I 

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:12.419
 baseball player 

00:41:12.419 --> 00:41:14.309
 and I just love places 

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:16.199
 two inches above my navel 

00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:19.249
 and though some guy could walk out and he could hit, you know three or four 

00:41:19.249 --> 00:41:21.920
 thumbs down what I call for strikes, because I never find 

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.049
 officially 

00:41:23.049 --> 00:41:25.479
 you can get Colorado strikes in baseball 

00:41:25.479 --> 00:41:26.589
 you have to 

00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:30.319
 You have to swing it places that you don't even necessarily want 

00:41:30.319 --> 00:41:33.279
 degree, to the land of the San two strikes 

00:41:33.279 --> 00:41:34.539
 in business 

00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:37.129
 units that have something you can sit there and 

00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:40.459
 says the paper General Motors of sixty years as John electric hundred and 

00:41:40.459 --> 00:41:44.039
 fifty years as general dynamics of sixty 

00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:46.530
 And if you want these prices you have to swing you can wait there 

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:50.839
 day after day after day after day, and there are no named strikes 

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:54.089
 now when you swing when you decide to buy something 

00:41:54.089 --> 00:41:56.589
 if enough you swing in it is just right but he 

00:41:56.589 --> 00:42:00.239
 it's a wonderful come to the end because there are no so-called strikes and you can 

00:42:00.239 --> 00:42:01.399
 simply wait 

00:42:01.399 --> 00:42:04.159
 for that one behind 

00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:05.829
 for six months for a year 

00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:07.129
 two or three years 

00:42:07.129 --> 00:42:09.420
 when you really know what you are doing where you like the price 

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.439
 We would like people to run the business 

00:42:11.439 --> 00:42:14.809
 and then you need to swing in the net a few swings in your life 

00:42:14.809 --> 00:42:17.869
 uh ... So what is the way we have a photo businesses that we try to keep up with 

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:19.529
 things we understand 

00:42:19.529 --> 00:42:23.009
 and that there can be all kinds of wonderful investment opportunities out there 

00:42:23.009 --> 00:42:23.759
 there 

00:42:23.759 --> 00:42:26.709
 But I don't understand I don't know what cocoa beach will do next year 

00:42:26.709 --> 00:42:28.849
 you know you might know, but I don't know if 

00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:33.319
 I don't know what I don't know what uh ... crude oil supplies sell for 

00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:34.889
 I don't need to know 

00:42:34.889 --> 00:42:36.510
 it's just knowing all the things 

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.170
 on knowing what I know 

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:42.199
 Pastor Noel where the boundaries of the Mayan concept are harsh 

00:42:42.199 --> 00:42:43.079
 what I call 

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:45.439
 what my circle conferences 

00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:49.719
 and finally able to evaluate five percent of the businesses in the world 

00:42:49.719 --> 00:42:53.779
 no problem I just put in a five percent and try something 

00:42:53.779 --> 00:42:56.629
 and that most people are in trouble because 

00:42:56.629 --> 00:42:59.209
 in investments because they 

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.770
 which we did a cheap and I look at the support of salsa 

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.670
 they hear about other people making money nothing upsets people so much 

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.399
 they about their friends making money cabinet 

00:43:07.399 --> 00:43:10.669
 it is very destructive to discipline because i think i have smart man next door 

00:43:10.669 --> 00:43:13.939
 neighbor's just bought that new car with the money made trading stock on it 

00:43:13.939 --> 00:43:15.879
 the internet, so I can die 

00:43:15.879 --> 00:43:18.989
 Well the answers that you can't dot work will lose you money for trading stocks 

00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:20.130
 active 

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.469
 and uh ... 

00:43:21.469 --> 00:43:24.959
 uh ... it's hard to practice at this point 

00:43:24.959 --> 00:43:26.949
 but every time you buy something 

00:43:26.949 --> 00:43:28.779
 you must be able to take out a 

00:43:28.779 --> 00:43:31.079
 one patient a paper 

00:43:31.079 --> 00:43:35.549
 I say I travel more help is the purchase of sixty-five I buy Gallagher hundred 

00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:36.120
 fifty 

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.549
 because 

00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:39.949
 and you must write down the reasons 

00:43:39.949 --> 00:43:41.589
 to cancel the tab 

00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:44.369
 it's because someone told me about a cocktail last night it is not 

00:43:44.369 --> 00:43:45.399
 good enough 

00:43:45.399 --> 00:43:48.959
 because because my broker told me it is not good enough 

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:52.019
 it is a you have a reason to have 

00:43:52.019 --> 00:43:54.390
 To think that it is an intelligent investor that you do the same 

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:58.249
 thing if you are buying a farm apartment house for sale apartments are by this 

00:43:58.249 --> 00:43:59.309
 parma 

00:43:59.309 --> 00:44:02.889
 a thousand dollars an acre because I think sixty dollars an acre can earn on it 

00:44:02.889 --> 00:44:06.399
 If quan sell so-and-so destroy himself so-and-so must be able to 

00:44:06.399 --> 00:44:07.659
 so-and-so 

00:44:07.659 --> 00:44:09.199
 and you have a solution 

00:44:09.199 --> 00:44:10.979
 This is the same reason you buy 

00:44:10.979 --> 00:44:13.789
 businesses and when you buy shares you buy a piece of the 

00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:14.919
 business 

00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:18.639
 and as part of the most important thing to remember and interesting is that 

00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:21.789
 When you have a stock the purchase of your important piece of votes was sent 

00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:24.879
 When you buy it has an attractive price for the business for the whole 

00:44:24.879 --> 00:44:25.709
 business 

00:44:25.709 --> 00:44:26.979
 you donate money 

00:44:26.979 --> 00:44:28.739
 and if you don't 

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:35.739
 The time you spend money 

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:38.039
 promotes Michael 

00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:40.889
 Home Reverend Jackson Jesse Jackson charges were there 

00:44:40.889 --> 00:44:44.369
 you seem to believe that the moral standards are smart in today's society 

00:44:44.369 --> 00:44:46.279
 eventually this business becomes 

00:44:46.279 --> 00:44:50.039
 how you feel it will affect us as youth grow up in nine countries, he said 

00:44:50.039 --> 00:44:52.470
 Most important to stop 

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.679
 Poetry Institute 

00:44:54.679 --> 00:44:55.610
 OPEC disagrees 

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.319
 this is BYO 

00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.979
 you reunite 

00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:00.789
 Well, I guess 

00:45:00.789 --> 00:45:02.709
 very difficult 

00:45:02.709 --> 00:45:04.569
 quantify 

00:45:04.569 --> 00:45:07.379
 moral standards overtime I mean, at that 

00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:11.329
 you know you can give choose from major weaknesses at any given time 

00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:12.819
 terms of how 

00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:17.389
 before the country's behavior and and and and and you want to hit so I think it is 

00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:19.699
 usually difficult to quantify 

00:45:19.699 --> 00:45:21.190
 uh ... I think 

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.599
 by and great we made 

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:27.669
 progress in what I would call institutionalized moral standards 

00:45:27.669 --> 00:45:29.039
 in this country 

00:45:29.039 --> 00:45:31.089
 I mean the the uh ... 

00:45:31.089 --> 00:45:35.369
 uh ... clock in terms of slavery in terms of uh ... in terms of them in the 

00:45:35.369 --> 00:45:38.359
 women women couldn't vote you know from a century ago at uh ... 

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:40.769
 uh ... 

00:45:40.769 --> 00:45:44.200
 half of the country were second-class citizens in that respect in a lot and 

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:44.630
 They have 

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:48.039
 far less rights in terms of inheritance and all kinds of things 

00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:49.579
 uh ... 

00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:51.549
 the income tax 

00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:53.409
 uh ... 

00:45:53.409 --> 00:45:54.869
 did not exist 

00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:58.599
 a hundred years ago so the idea of ​​taxing people who according to 

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:00.189
 how much the 

00:46:00.189 --> 00:46:03.159
 they have benefited from the community in their income 

00:46:03.159 --> 00:46:04.820
 uh ... didn't exist that way 

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.729
 I think in terms of institutionalized moral standards 

00:46:08.729 --> 00:46:10.509
 made the land 

00:46:10.509 --> 00:46:13.199
 really very significant progress uh ... 

00:46:13.199 --> 00:46:15.819
 and uh ... in the last hundred years I think you know 

00:46:15.819 --> 00:46:18.819
 there is another must distance to go I think we are going in the right direction 

00:46:18.819 --> 00:46:21.129
 Maybe through jerks and punches 

00:46:21.129 --> 00:46:24.729
 but I think we're going to write correction and I think 

00:46:24.729 --> 00:46:25.879
 uh ... 

00:46:25.879 --> 00:46:28.649
 you know that there is a 

00:46:28.649 --> 00:46:31.969
 it will be a considerable cost to everyone in this role as they live in a lake 

00:46:31.969 --> 00:46:35.439
 moral society forty years from now as callosum Although I think the odds are 

00:46:35.439 --> 00:46:36.679
 that they will 

00:46:36.679 --> 00:46:39.839
 I think the country is moving in the direction of very difficult to do so 

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.559
 all types of stakeholders 

00:46:41.559 --> 00:46:43.369
 doesn't work against it, though 

00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:44.079
 uh ... 

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:46.789
 Anne and I think the American people will 

00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:49.720
 and then civil rights are sought Manitoba 

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.869
 television to dramatize what's going on 

00:46:52.869 --> 00:46:56.659
 people do not want Europe to not think about it 

00:46:56.659 --> 00:47:00.170
 it has penetrated the conscience of uh ... the American people 

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:01.469
 and uh ... 

00:47:01.469 --> 00:47:04.519
 uh ... grant of progress made there and there is a lot to be left 

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:06.929
 but they are better that I 

00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:09.919
 and the pace may seem very slow to the people involved and I can understand 

00:47:09.919 --> 00:47:11.059
 that 

00:47:11.059 --> 00:47:12.239
 uh ... 

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:13.029
 the pace 

00:47:13.029 --> 00:47:15.769
 you know for a woman's right to vote 

00:47:15.769 --> 00:47:17.919
 for decades and decades and decades 

00:47:17.919 --> 00:47:19.719
 woman can be on a jury 

00:47:19.719 --> 00:47:22.649
 that I was doing the hearing part sterile 

00:47:22.649 --> 00:47:26.509
 which occurred in California of nineteen O. ten or eleven 

00:47:26.509 --> 00:47:30.949
 Uh ... There are no women on the jury that have a man in a great deal of behavior 

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:32.739
 our citizens in the sense that 

00:47:32.739 --> 00:47:33.839
 so it is 

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:35.359
 the moral 

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:38.549
 behavior of the country has my eye 

00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:40.859
 improve, but it uh ... 

00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:41.970
 uh ... to them 

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.760
 and it will continue to improve and I hope you all in this room do your part to 

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:51.760
 help approach 

00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:55.769
 decay of the central high 

00:47:55.769 --> 00:47:57.789
 and uh ... 

00:47:57.789 --> 00:48:01.699
 wonder how we are in the stock market so high right now 

00:48:01.699 --> 00:48:03.479
 would be smart for us to give 

00:48:03.479 --> 00:48:05.759
 to get involved now is to wait until 

00:48:05.759 --> 00:48:08.979
 trickles down a bit 

00:48:08.979 --> 00:48:12.309
 Yes, I can tell you whether shares for sale are common 

00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:14.200
 I think it's important that you save money 

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.719
 on what they want the stock market to put out there 

00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:20.329
 I don't think so 

00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:23.869
 terribly important I think if you are interested in stocks 

00:48:23.869 --> 00:48:27.129
 issued by a and you have some you have to buy if you mean I get II 

00:48:27.129 --> 00:48:28.839
 any way of running over them 

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:32.309
 better than x print when im papers with same 

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:35.999
 I can guarantee you if you lose money on paper lose real money this is another 

00:48:35.999 --> 00:48:38.999
 experience and uh ... 

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:43.969
 I'm so iii think they think you'll learn more about yourself 

00:48:43.969 --> 00:48:44.889
 uh ... 

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:47.379
 if you do it so i got my first bow 

00:48:47.379 --> 00:48:50.419
 When I was eleven I was actually a liberal some of the time and with about 

00:48:50.419 --> 00:48:54.149
 three shares of city service preferred 

00:48:54.149 --> 00:48:55.559
 thirty-eight panna 

00:48:55.559 --> 00:48:58.649
 went down to twenty-seven, which is something I still remember even a 

00:48:58.649 --> 00:48:59.939
 lots of time 

00:48:59.939 --> 00:49:03.449
 uh ... and then a bunch of four and I'm selling on I'm a five dollar 

00:49:03.449 --> 00:49:06.609
 on my free shares to commissions and then I have up to two hundred and something 

00:49:06.609 --> 00:49:08.069
 so 

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:11.049
 You know iii probably remember that a little better than I want to do it on 

00:49:11.049 --> 00:49:13.659
 paper it 

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:16.939
 I thought we were doing a lot of things between about eleven years old and 

00:49:16.939 --> 00:49:20.369
 nineteen in the stock market I have short-sighted all kinds of 

00:49:20.369 --> 00:49:25.109
 technical analysis I read every book I could find on the subject 

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:30.299
 I didn't do it so well I could do terribly, but I just beat it while Rob 

00:49:30.299 --> 00:49:31.499
 but bite 

00:49:31.499 --> 00:49:34.930
 What is meant by the age of nineteen when I read Ben Graham spoke of the universe 

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.399
 depressed him like that 

00:49:36.399 --> 00:49:39.709
 I went and found this book called Intelligent Buster just coming out 

00:49:39.709 --> 00:49:42.069
 And I have a big impact on me 

00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:43.929
 But if I did, 

00:49:43.929 --> 00:49:46.789
 In the previous eight years I have been over fate 

00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:50.129
 I'm not so sure that the book where the sender was background and I was by that time 

00:49:50.129 --> 00:49:52.139
 I was prepared to 

00:49:52.139 --> 00:49:55.390
 to read and was to read book that changed my life and actually 

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.679
 the incredible life 

00:49:57.679 --> 00:49:58.799
 uh ... 

00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:03.249
 uh ... I wouldn't be a part of it if I wrote a book 

00:50:03.249 --> 00:50:06.949
 part of life is to 

00:50:06.949 --> 00:50:09.599
 when something significant happens 

00:50:09.599 --> 00:50:10.969
 please call us 

00:50:10.969 --> 00:50:14.179
 the meaning of it and know what to do with it 

00:50:14.179 --> 00:50:16.959
 I would say that the first eight years ahead of her 

00:50:16.959 --> 00:50:19.589
 it did not yield anything financially to speak of 

00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:20.500
 uh ... 

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.519
 have a lot in terms of getting my mind up 

00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:26.599
 But I didn't really read anything that made sense, so I was ready to 

00:50:26.599 --> 00:50:27.719
 assume that 

00:50:27.719 --> 00:50:29.799
 and I actually went back in 

00:50:29.799 --> 00:50:34.599
 when to call me the study under the under Graham 

00:50:34.599 --> 00:50:35.869
 as a result of 

00:50:35.869 --> 00:50:38.939
 from reading the book of all kinds of things that flowed out of itself 

00:50:38.939 --> 00:50:42.289
 I would like to encourage you if you are interested in the field 

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:46.019
 uh ... 

00:50:46.019 --> 00:50:49.260
 a few things to do, but so far, but intelligence was possible 

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.720
 I want to try to keep up with things 

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.390
 businesses I thought I understood 

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.389
 but still get that paper 

00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:56.819
 and I want to read I don't, because 

00:50:56.819 --> 00:51:00.519
 and just trust my reasoning that I will go back and revisit the year later 

00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:03.889
 and see if what you thought would prove to be true 

00:51:03.889 --> 00:51:05.919
 So I would always checked myself 

00:51:05.919 --> 00:51:09.649
 I believe in the format of myself on everything from the doctors have autopsies 

00:51:09.649 --> 00:51:12.919
 and they do them because they are out of autopsies 

00:51:12.919 --> 00:51:16.149
 uh ... and business people don't like to not be tagged when im all i can be 

00:51:16.149 --> 00:51:20.089
 on the board of directors of the company 

00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:22.129
 building plants for sale companies 

00:51:22.129 --> 00:51:23.909
 and all two years later 

00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:26.609
 tour I see how the decision seems to do it 

00:51:26.609 --> 00:51:28.680
 they can be unpleasant 

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.089
 but you learn from autopsy 

00:51:31.089 --> 00:51:32.169
 and uh ... 

00:51:32.169 --> 00:51:35.099
 you don't want to learn to burn us out of other people's mistakes in your own this 

00:51:35.099 --> 00:51:37.639
 pattern of some of your own and uh ... 

00:51:37.639 --> 00:51:41.729
 The time to do this is when you are young 

00:51:41.729 --> 00:51:43.759
 what you can do maybe one more 

00:51:43.759 --> 00:51:45.780
 direct attack Wonder 

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.739
 Maybe maybe two more p 

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:52.009
 well my name is Piet Wilson from Craig improv 

00:51:52.009 --> 00:51:53.389
 my question is 

00:51:53.389 --> 00:51:56.410
 to some extent you feel that the government 

00:51:56.410 --> 00:52:00.440
 with uh ... the current policy of welfare and social security is it 

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.619
 financially competent and physically prepared 

00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:06.809
 for the future 

00:52:06.809 --> 00:52:09.809
 I think I think that 

00:52:09.809 --> 00:52:12.029
 the country as a whole is many 

00:52:12.029 --> 00:52:15.229
 very well prepared for the future of it does not mean that 

00:52:15.229 --> 00:52:18.389
 with just about every policy they have, though 

00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:19.769
 uh ... 

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:20.650
 I think 

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.859
 eight we have a very rich society 

00:52:22.859 --> 00:52:26.139
 and want to return a home and they will be richer 

00:52:26.139 --> 00:52:29.169
 uh ... everyone is not going to participate in anything that will 

00:52:29.169 --> 00:52:30.789
 participate because of 

00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:33.949
 physical disabilities or because of a mental disability due to others 

00:52:33.949 --> 00:52:38.259
 shortcomings in the education they receive winner all kinds of reasons 

00:52:38.259 --> 00:52:41.369
 We have a prosperous life in our society 

00:52:41.369 --> 00:52:42.899
 be able to take care of 

00:52:42.899 --> 00:52:44.379
 of the people 

00:52:44.379 --> 00:52:45.630
 and we have to take care of them 

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:49.490
 and how we do that so that they feel most useful in life and how we do it so 

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:53.090
 that we continue to encourage people to be more productive themselves all that I do 

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:54.219
 means it is 

00:52:54.219 --> 00:52:56.049
 which easy questions though 

00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:59.399
 But it must take us to feel off the wall that we need to do something 

00:52:59.399 --> 00:53:01.099
 about that uh ... 

00:53:01.099 --> 00:53:04.819
 uh ... opt-in I've been keeping this issue down sometimes to the people I say 

00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:08.660
 Assume that it was twenty-four hours before you were born 

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:12.019
 all you can take is the steps twenty-four hours before it went 

00:53:12.019 --> 00:53:14.649
 and then they come to you 

00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:17.149
 and the spirit says 

00:53:17.149 --> 00:53:20.699
 overdrew their weather out there 

00:53:20.699 --> 00:53:22.809
 you call go 

00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:24.769
 and the Jenny says work 

00:53:24.769 --> 00:53:26.889
 if you look pretty promising 

00:53:26.889 --> 00:53:30.049
 I think you kind of have a sense of fair play in it 

00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:31.359
 on a good thought 

00:53:31.359 --> 00:53:35.659
 and I'm going to let you have an extraordinary opportunity 

00:53:35.659 --> 00:53:39.419
 I'm going to let you design the world in which you're going to be born into 

00:53:39.419 --> 00:53:41.189
 twenty-four hours 

00:53:41.189 --> 00:53:42.549
 this is yours 

00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:44.539
 you choose from the political rules 

00:53:44.539 --> 00:53:46.679
 you make the economic rules 

00:53:46.679 --> 00:53:50.449
 you adhere to the social rules you design around the world 

00:53:50.449 --> 00:53:55.069
 and we are over twenty four hours you are going to be one that I the world 

00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:58.089
 and this is the world just stands for your life 

00:53:58.089 --> 00:54:01.899
 for your children's lifetime fairground shorts lifetime 

00:54:01.899 --> 00:54:05.439
 and you have if some of the Genie jokes would say in the past 

00:54:05.439 --> 00:54:07.199
 What is the catch 

00:54:07.199 --> 00:54:10.789
 and Jenny has a good catch 

00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:14.140
 soon when you are born in twenty-four hours you will emerge 

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.019
 this world you design 

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:18.089
 But what you do not know 

00:54:18.089 --> 00:54:20.349
 is whether you are going to be born 

00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:22.119
 black or white 

00:54:22.119 --> 00:54:23.949
 male or female 

00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:25.569
 rich or poor 

00:54:25.569 --> 00:54:27.619
 brighter delay 

00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:29.609
 resilient or ill 

00:54:29.609 --> 00:54:32.439
 in the United States or Afghanistan 

00:54:32.439 --> 00:54:34.349
 all you know 

00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:36.380
 is that you are going to achieve in this 

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.649
 taking what is now six billion Bowles withheld is that one person 

00:54:40.649 --> 00:54:42.010
 every person in the world 

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:45.579
 and you're going to take part in what I call the ovarian lottery 

00:54:45.579 --> 00:54:49.889
 you can take one bought a rubber never another book you 

00:54:49.889 --> 00:54:52.169
 area one ball not even a dealer 

00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:54.149
 now what kind of rules 

00:54:54.149 --> 00:54:56.489
 do what you want to society 

00:54:56.489 --> 00:54:59.499
 not knowing which ball you are going to get 

00:54:59.499 --> 00:55:00.520
 now that night 

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.119
 but has to do with the way 

00:55:02.119 --> 00:55:03.859
 I think people should think about 

00:55:03.859 --> 00:55:06.839
 social policy and if you are born if you are lucky enough to be born around this 

00:55:06.839 --> 00:55:09.900
 land you already won the lottery 

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.559
 We must have a system in my mind 

00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:16.429
 what encourages the Jack Welch in the Bill Gates is to work it all out 

00:55:16.429 --> 00:55:20.369
 far out of time when it wants any economic interest for us 

00:55:20.369 --> 00:55:23.089
 people command the resources that 

00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:26.529
 many able to commander of the mets home pets have a high standard of 

00:55:26.529 --> 00:55:27.959
 moving forward 

00:55:27.959 --> 00:55:29.279
 so we must 

00:55:29.279 --> 00:55:31.269
 you know we need one Tom Osborne 

00:55:31.269 --> 00:55:35.339
 going to new york we want us to have Bill Gates design software and 

00:55:35.339 --> 00:55:39.150
 We don't want a mix up to those two hundred Well, I don't want coaching to go in 

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.329
 the purple kit uh ... sell 

00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:43.719
 you what you want people to fill a system that 

00:55:43.719 --> 00:55:44.800
 welded 

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.619
 do people get other potential m 

00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:47.959
 and put them 

00:55:47.959 --> 00:55:51.099
 in the position where they can do the most good for society 

00:55:51.099 --> 00:55:53.530
 who also wants system for people get the wrong lol 

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:55.889
 timing someone is going to get the ball 

00:55:55.889 --> 00:55:59.039
 you know what say eighty I want to make a couple is going to get the ball 

00:55:59.039 --> 00:56:03.119
 That says it is easier to cripple the disease early in life zone 

00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:05.719
 and we have an empire in our society 

00:56:05.719 --> 00:56:10.189
 that we can help us take care of the people and I think that 

00:56:10.189 --> 00:56:13.599
 As your question I think this association will move more and more into that 

00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:16.489
 direction it has the ability to move more and more towards it 

00:56:16.489 --> 00:56:18.309
 as our resources 

00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:21.849
 uh ... and our production is increasing and I think the 

00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:24.989
 It has the will to do it in a general way but I can't say they always have 

00:56:24.989 --> 00:56:28.959
 be taught to fit and start so they are not in short supply 

00:56:28.959 --> 00:56:31.609
 in the United States of Resources 

00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:34.329
 there is no shortage of output 

00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:35.969
 you have to have a system 

00:56:35.969 --> 00:56:37.969
 which encourages people to 

00:56:37.969 --> 00:56:40.060
 to limit their limitations 

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.489
 abilities and put them in the right place 

00:56:42.489 --> 00:56:46.089
 but then you have to make sure everyone gets taken care of two 

00:56:46.089 --> 00:56:50.509
 now we can have one more and then we will break 

00:56:50.509 --> 00:56:52.759
 put it over the microphone woman here 

00:56:52.759 --> 00:56:57.150
 make the decision 

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:59.959
 Hyman's Bengal is going on a solid 

00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:04.319
 And I want to know how you can make the media extra-large in other places 

00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:05.249
 months 

00:57:05.249 --> 00:57:08.769
 small question uh ... 

00:57:08.769 --> 00:57:10.779
 good, but of course not 

00:57:10.779 --> 00:57:12.119
 simply because it 

00:57:12.119 --> 00:57:14.569
 has moved so far technologically 

00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:18.379
 is it got it together yahoo and i was all over china two years ago, when i 

00:57:18.379 --> 00:57:21.049
 right after the time of the women's conference 

00:57:21.049 --> 00:57:23.099
 and uh ... in Beijing 

00:57:23.099 --> 00:57:25.209
 and I read 

00:57:25.209 --> 00:57:26.379
 the Chinese 

00:57:26.379 --> 00:57:28.729
 coverage 

00:57:28.729 --> 00:57:31.039
 of the conference a and of course it is 

00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:34.129
 it has nothing to do and what was going on, but the internet is coming and going 

00:57:34.129 --> 00:57:35.599
 and one 

00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:37.149
 you know you can't 

00:57:37.149 --> 00:57:38.619
 you can access 

00:57:38.619 --> 00:57:41.979
 the Washington Post in the New York Times and II the Washington Post 

00:57:41.979 --> 00:57:43.679
 thirty-nine years night 

00:57:43.679 --> 00:57:44.719
 in effect 

00:57:44.719 --> 00:57:45.730
 I never could get that 

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:50.299
 next day due to physical delivery, but I want to buy electronic delivery 

00:57:50.299 --> 00:57:51.579
 I can read it 

00:57:51.579 --> 00:57:56.959
 uh ... Denver Bali used to be the most people in Washington to repeat itself 

00:57:56.959 --> 00:57:59.189
 ability to communicate 

00:57:59.189 --> 00:58:02.309
 and the degree to which the world has an awareness of what's going on each 

00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:04.449
 place in the world is just 

00:58:04.449 --> 00:58:08.149
 You know it is only applied 

00:58:08.149 --> 00:58:13.619
 And that will help them have written them a lot of things out of that 

00:58:13.619 --> 00:58:16.919
 there plus overtime, but that they were AB 

00:58:16.919 --> 00:58:20.699
 the ability to make information available to everyone 

00:58:20.699 --> 00:58:24.009
 worldwide almost immediately his 

00:58:24.009 --> 00:58:29.049
 that is it is it is too great to be progress and things like medicine for example justice 

00:58:29.049 --> 00:58:31.419
 uh ... 

00:58:31.419 --> 00:58:34.189
 that is it is this is a net plus it has a 

00:58:34.189 --> 00:58:37.049
 it has a big affected 

00:58:37.049 --> 00:58:40.329
 the definition of the media has now expanded 

00:58:40.329 --> 00:58:43.639
 anonymous I mean, there were three television networks and 

00:58:43.639 --> 00:58:46.989
 in the nineteen and you know in the early sixties and that was it 

00:58:46.989 --> 00:58:51.469
 there were three highways information traveled electronically 

00:58:51.469 --> 00:58:54.900
 As the three piece of information I loved Lucy and I want something different and 

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.969
 something else that goes along with the three choices of information or entertainment 

00:58:57.969 --> 00:58:59.439
 what you had 

00:58:59.439 --> 00:59:03.219
 first ten and ten of millions of people sell their search for it 

00:59:03.219 --> 00:59:06.519
 now it is unlimited and it has only been so for three or so decades 

00:59:06.519 --> 00:59:09.539
 it just exploded and it will continue to explore it 

00:59:09.539 --> 00:59:11.499
 net I think that's a plus 

00:59:11.499 --> 00:59:14.739
 And I think it's 1am I want to thank you all 

00:59:14.739 --> 00:59:16.670
 I wish you well you're going to do a tremendous job now
