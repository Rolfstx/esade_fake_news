00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.290
At the height of the 2016 election researchers
released a report warning about a strange

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.390
propaganda technique.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.070
Another day, another lie, another conspiracy
theory, another falsehood.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.259
They called it the "firehose of falsehood."

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.920
When a propagandist bombards people with more
lies than they can possibly keep up.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.340
Why all these lies?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.449
Why is it lie after lie after lie?

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.500
According to the report, these lies don't
have to be believable.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.500
It wasn't just a lie.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.999
It was such a bad obvious lie.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.760
Researchers found that even obvious lies had
the potential to be highly effective at shaping

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.760
public opinion.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.790
I mean he just says things and then they are
the truth in the world of the Donald.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.950
The thing is, that report wasn't about Trump.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.100
It didn't even mention him.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.590
It was about Russian propaganda.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.000
And it raised an interesting question: How
could a powerful leader benefit from telling

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
obvious lies?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.300
We've signed more bills than any president
ever.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.040
The president just simply lies for no reason.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.030
I was against the war in Iraq.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.860
Why lie about something that you don't have
to lie about?

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.910
You have people registered in two states.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.910
They vote twice.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.010
Why does he keep repeating it if it's obviously
not true?

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.820
We're going to get to Trump in a minute.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.820
Hell yeah!

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.610
But before that, we have to talk to Christopher
Paul.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.640
I'm a senior social scientist at the RAND
Corporation.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.060
He co-wrote the report on Russian firehosing
and he described it as having four key characteristics.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.620
Russian propaganda is high volume and multichannel.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.890
It's rapid, continuous, and repetitive.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.580
It makes no commitment to objective reality.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.280
And it makes no commitment to consistency.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.530
Oooh, sounds like Trump.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.670
Can you give me a second?

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm building a narrative here.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.060
The first two characteristics are pretty standard
for propaganda.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.510
Research shows that if we hear a lie from
multiple sources, we think of it as more credible.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.550
The same is true for lies we hear repeatedly.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.090
The more familiar we are with a lie, the more
likely we are to think of it as true.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.380
But the last two characteristics — no commitment
to objective reality or consistency — that's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.380
surprising.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.200
They don't care that much about the truth.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.920
Much of their propaganda is either completely
false or has a kernel of truth.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.340
Maybe the most jarring example this was in
2014, when the world watched as Russian troops

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.340
entered Ukraine.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.609
There were a bunch of Russian soldiers wearing
uniforms without insignia and those were dubbed

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:13.609
“little green men.”

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:14.760
This was a huge deal.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.540
Russia was essentially invading a country
they had said they were not going to invade.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.389
But when Putin was asked about it:

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.319
Were these Russian soldiers?

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.319
No.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.049
These were local self-defense forces.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.590
Putin vehemently denied.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.329
“No no, the little green men are not Russian
soldiers.”

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.200
It wasn't just that Putin was lying.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.709
He was lying about something so obvious.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.830
There was footage of the soldiers airing on
TV.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.200
Russian troops spreading out throughout the
strategic Crimean Peninsula.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.489
And then, a few weeks later, he just said
the opposite.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.969
Of course, we had our servicemen.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.340
They were acting very correctly.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.470
No “I'm sorry.”

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.680
No “I misspoke.”

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.409
Just, “Of course we have troops there.”

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.709
This is counterintuitive.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.219
This is not what I expected.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.720
I come from an influence background that says
credibility is king and the truth will always

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.720
win.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.909
Part of being a good liar is not getting caught.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.709
Making sure your lies are at least somewhat
believable.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.719
When Dick Cheney said, "There is no doubt
Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,"

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.599
he was lying, but to most people who aren't
intelligence experts, it sounded credible.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.510
If someone asks, "Hey did you eat my sandwich?"

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.510
You'd say, "Nope.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.430
I brought my lunch from home."

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.069
You wouldn't say, "You never had a sandwich."

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.499
But when it comes the firehosing, believability
doesn't really matter.

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:38.590
I think being willing to not be seen as credible
is okay with the Russians.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.590
We'll come back to this.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.680
But right now it's

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
TRUMP TIME!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.680
Trump time.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.370
Since the election, people have pointed out
that Trump uses firehosing too.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.859
I really had no view that this would be anything
that anyone would think about applying to

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.420
American politics.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.480
That's not what I'm about.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.969
I am concerned with foreign intervention in
our political processes.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:59.969
Okay, fine.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.879
Donovan, bring in the second interview please.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.599
Thank you.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.769
I think it can be deceptive just how different
they look.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.719
But despite the different styles, I think
they do the exact same thing.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.909
This is Masha Gessen.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.540
She's a Russian-American journalist, activist,
and all around badass.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.069
And she's been warning about the similarities
between Trump and Putin for years.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:27.170
They just create sort of this unmanageable
volume of falsehood.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.990
Gessen argues that firehosing — telling
and retelling obvious lies — isn't about

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.500
persuasion.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.530
It's about power.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.350
When Putin says there are no troops in Crimea
or when Trump says he never mocked a disabled

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.550
reporter, they're not just lying.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.780
They're asserting that they are not constrained
by reality.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.830
That everything, even things that are totally
obvious to us, can be challenged.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.680
That's a very clear demonstration of power.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.789
You have to engage with what he said even
though it's false.

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.491
Those last two features a firehosing — the
shamelessness, the inconsistency — they're

00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.680
kind of the point.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.509
The way that they lie that makes the obviousness
of the lie part of the powerplay.

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:12.490
Yes, I know that you know what I'm saying
is absurd, and I assert my right to say whatever

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.900
I want whenever I want to.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.870
He keeps urinating on the sidewalk and we
have to keep wiping it up.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.370
Not the sidewalk, the living room rug.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.370
Yeah.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.370
On the rug!

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.370
What are you cheering for right now?

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.699
Our knee-jerk reaction to lies like this is
to fact-check them.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.560
Fact checkers are having a field day with
this one.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.599
President Obama did not found ISIS.

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.050
He was not wiretapped, there was no warrant
out.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.039
It is not the biggest tax cut in US history
as the fact-checkers have noted.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.669
But if the goal of firehosing is to assert
power, fact-checking misses the point.

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.599
There is nothing quite so humiliating and
disempowering as trying to prove the truth.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.610
Think of a schoolyard bully who says, "Why
are you hitting yourself?

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.910
Why are you hitting yourself?"

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.659
Degrading you by forcing you to argue with
the obvious.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.330
"Why are you hitting yourself?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.330
Why are you hitting yourself?"

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.330
Yeah, you'd know about being bullied.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.330
I sure would.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.330
Thank you.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.120
And I think that's kind of what it feels like
when we fact-check Trump.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.169
It's sullying.

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.550
You feel like you've engaged with something
that actually shouldn't be a part of the public

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.550
sphere.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.360
Firehosing turns even the most obvious of
facts into a messy, mind-numbing political

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360
fight.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.159
Every time he gets fact-checked Trump lashes
out.

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.520
They just don't want to report the truth.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.909
Sarah Sanders blames the media.

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.330
If anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty
that often takes place by the news media.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.949
And something that should not have even been
up for debate starts to look like just another

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.580
screaming match where no one really seems
credible.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.590
Donald Trump lies and he lies compulsively.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:49.370
So this very simple human assumption that
you can know what's true, that assumption

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.560
is taken away from you.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.710
You have to work for the truth and the hope
is that, yeah, you'll get exhausted and you'll

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.810
eventually give up.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.810
I'm getting depressed.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.810
I know, buddy.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.080
I'm almost done.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.330
We're all almost done.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.539
The ultimate goal of firehosing isn't to pass
lies off as truth.

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.969
It's to rob concepts like facts and reality
of their power.

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:10.439
You stand by that claim about him?

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.439
I don't stand by anything.

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:13.780
I have my own opinions, you can have your
own opinions.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.510
To reduce truth to just a position.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.389
Isn't it important just to, like, have factual
debates when discussing these things?

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:23.490
Well, as you just commented, there's lots
of different ways of looking at it.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.699
You're saying it's a falsehood and they're
giving alternative facts.

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:28.391
It's somebody's version of the truth, not
the truth.

00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:29.740
Truth is truth.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.389
I don't mean to go like...

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.530
No it isn't truth.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.530
Truth isn't truth.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.610
And if that sounds a little abstract, just
listen to what Putin said during his press

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.669
conference with Trump in July.

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.789
As to who is to be believed, you can trust
no one.

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:46.050
He defends the interests of the United States
of America.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.919
And I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation.

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.879
So Putin just basically wanted to establish
as a baseline that no one can be trusted.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:56.729
Everybody's pursuing their own strategic interests
and there's no such thing as the truth.

00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:59.599
And a few days later Trump took that argument
a step further.

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:05.990
And just remember, what you're seeing and
what you're reading is not what's happening.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.120
Just stick with us.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.039
Don't believe the crap you see from these
people, the fake news.

00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:13.569
Just stick with us.

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:16.189
Essentially, reality is about picking sides.

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:20.499
They're basically saying there's no war between
people who know the truth and people who are

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:21.499
lying.

00:08:21.499 --> 00:08:22.650
There's only positional warfare.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.310
Whoever has a better position.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.940
Whoever has objectively more power owns reality.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.669
And it's remarkable how effective that is.

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:36.970
Maybe you can just start acting like you have
total power and it will not exactly give you

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.290
total power but it will give you a hell of
a lot more power than an American president

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:45.580
should have.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.060
You never had a sandwich.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.100
You never had a...
