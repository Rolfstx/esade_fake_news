00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.200
 Your real wealth is your time and your freedom. Money is only a tool corresponding to your time 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.800
 It is a container to store your economic energy until you are ready to spend it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.600
 But the whole world abandoned the use of real money and was deceived into converting it to currency 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.300
 A prankster quack quietly steals your most valuable assets 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.900
 Your time and freedom. Welcome to the rabbit cage. 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.300
 We are heading towards a financial crisis that is one of the greatest in the world. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 The transfer of wealth that will take place during this decade is the greatest in history. 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 Wealth is not destroyed. It was moved. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.000
 This means that on the other side of each crisis there is an opportunity. 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 The good news is that all you have to do to turn this crisis into a great opportunity for you is to educate yourself. 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.000
 I think the best deal you can make in your life is educating yourself 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.400
 Learn about the history of money. 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 Learn about financing. Learn about the way the global economy works 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.100
 Learning about the way all these men, central bankers, and the stock market, can how they cheat you, and scam on you. 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.500
 If you know what is going on and how the financial world works, you can put yourself on the right side of this wealth transfer. 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 Winston Churchill once said: The farther you looked in the past, the farther you looked in the future 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 This program is to help you create your crystal ball (juggler). 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.600
 To be able to see the future. 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.900
 To be able to turn this crisis, the biggest crisis in human history, into your great opportunity. 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.200
 The hidden secrets of money. Some of them are hidden but in front of everyone. 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
 It is just in front of you. 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.600
 The way the monetary system works is not completely hidden from all of us. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.900
 It's open, but it's complicated and people just can't understand how it works. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.900
 It is hard for them to imagine that we are living in such a hoax. 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.600
 Others strive to be a secret, but the truth slowly emerges. 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.600
 Such as the Federal Reserve being a private company and not really part of the United States government. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:49.400
 But when I started studying this, what I found was that there is no place where I can guide people where they can get the whole truth in one place. 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:59.100
 Essentially because of this, I decided to write my book on this topic to establish the history of monetary system, the economy, the markets, and the foundations of gold and silver. 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.000
 There is a lot of smoke and mirrors (blurring) in the economy, and my job is kind of raising fog in front of people. 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.240
 Welcome to Egypt. This is where it all began. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 About 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians began using gold and silver as the primary form of their currency, - 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.500
 But it was not money yet. 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.700
 Gold and silver coins were used in different sizes and weights. And with different purity degrees. 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.100
 So it was still not negotiable so that each unit was the same unit as its corresponding. This means that there was nothing of real price yet. 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.800
 You can't put a price consisting of a number of coins for something because they haven't had money yet. Trade was still difficult. 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.500
 It was still a guess game when the values ​​were exchanged. 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:06.700
 One of the reasons for the financial chaos that we are in today globally is that people do not understand the difference between currency and money. 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:16.200
 Currency is an exchange, unit of account, portable, durable, divisible, and so-called interchangeable. 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.000
 Replaceable means that each unit is the same as its next unit. 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.500
 The dollar in my pocket buys the same dollar in your pocket. 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.300
 Money is all of these things in addition to maintaining its value over a long period of time. 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.400
 Even your financial planners, bankers, and accountants don't understand the difference between currency and money. 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.600
 The currency in your pocket is a method of exchange. It is a unit of account because it holds numbers. 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.600
 It's somewhat durable, it's portable, it's divisible means you can split it into loose, and replaceable ones. 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.660
 The dollar in my pocket buys the same dollar in your pocket. 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.500
 But because governments can print more and more and more of them, and weaken currency stocks, - 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.300
 It constantly transfers wealth from your own pocket, from your bank account. To the government and the banking system. 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.800
 The reason why gold and silver are the ideal form of money lies in its properties. 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.900
 It is an easy way to exchange because gold and silver store a large amount of value in a very small space. 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.600
 It's an account unit. Pure gold has the same value throughout the planet. 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.900
 As the gold coin buys the same amount here in Egypt, in China or in the United States. 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.200
 It is durable. The same gold that Egyptians used to trade 5,000 years ago is still here with us today. 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.000
 It does not rust. It is divisible. 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.100
 You can turn it into a change. It is very portable. 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.700
 You can use something like oil as money. But you can not hold it on your back and wander around 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.100
 It is replaceable. Pure gold is the same wherever it is on earth. 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.500
 Pure silver is the same wherever it is on earth. But its quantity is limited 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.800
 This is why it maintains its purchasing power. Governments cannot print them. 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.000
 Over the past 5,000 years, only gold and silver have maintained their purchasing power. 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.600
 There were thousands and thousands of banknotes. 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.600
 Coins not supported by gold or silver, and all ended in zero !. He failed 100 percent. 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:41.800
 Well, the paper currency, of course, is the currency that is found by order of the government. 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.600
 They have their own presses, and paper money rolls are issued by those presses. 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.600
 Then the order is issued to make it the official currency. 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.100
 It is just a paper that has no value, but when Ben Bernanke (the governor of the central bank) signs it, and they make their sacred meeting. 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.300
 In FOMC meetings, it suddenly becomes a coin. 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.700
 If you look at what's really going on, it's a fool game. Therefore, you should trust them. 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.700
 Well ...., the Fed is very candid about what it does. 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.600
 If you read their website they will tell you it is a trust game. 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.200
 They tell you that there is no intrinsic value in their money. 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.280
 They will tell you that they have printed it not supported at all. 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.300
 In fact, they offer all these facts. 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.400
 But if I told someone on the way that this coin was created from scratch, there is nothing to support it 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.800
 And it has no value at all, and its value is like the value of the Monopoly money (the famous game), they will look at you as crazy. 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.700
 Is there an example in the history of banknotes, for a piece of paper that is not supported by something, survived (from collapse)? 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.200
 The short answer, no. 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.400
 The long answer is, no. And the reason is, 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.300
 When Addison Yagin (economist) _Daily Rukonink_ (financial consulting firm), 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.200
 Bill Bonner (American writer on economic affairs) asked him to index all banknotes throughout history and what happened to each of them. 

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:11.200
 Addison faithfully went to work. Within a short period of time, in alphabetical order. All banknotes beginning with the letter A have been indexed. 

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.800
 All of them ended in zero. He had counted half of the banknotes that started with the letter B, - 

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.900
 And counted 600 of them in the first letter and half of the second letter of the alphabet only. 

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:30.100
 And every one of them ended in zero ..... every one?!. 

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:38.800
 600 of the banknotes that start with the letter A, and the other half of those that start with the letter B, there are 600 of these things !!. 

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.500
 Not one of them is still present. 

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.600
 And you think this coin, the US dollar, will be the first to survive after all? I do not think so. 

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.700
 No, no paper currency has survived. 

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.100
 not a single one. 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 When we talk about money there is a widely accepted definition of money. 

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.800
 The question is, if you apply this definition to certain things that people confirm is money, do they match this definition? 

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.500
 Well we'll take a paper dollar for example. How will he do those jobs? 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:18.100
 Does it store value? The dollar has lost 95% of its purchasing power, since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913. 

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.500
 So it is not good enough to store the value. 

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.500
 If I wanted to do something to get the audience's attention I would put a slide and there are three pictures on the slide. 

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.690
 One is a pile of monopoly money. The second is a pile of the Federal Reserve currency. 

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.100
 Which Americans call money. 

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.200
 And the last for a piece of American gold coin. 

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.700
 The title of this slide is: Which of these is different? 

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.200
 And if you know Sesame Street (open Sesame Street) or if you have kids watching it, it's one of the short paragraphs on Sesame Street. 

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.200
 It is really a type of IQ test for five-year-olds. 

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.500
 They are supposed to look at three things, compare their properties, and try to find the different piece. 

00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:01.800
 Well ...., I showed this slide to a group of professors of Effie Universities (Association for the Biggest Eight Universities in America), and I also showed it to a group of five-year-olds. 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.400
 Like my nephews and my nephews and so on ... 

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:11.300
 And when the professors looked at the slide, they said well, it is clear that the history of the rest of the world - 

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.800
 Because gold is not used as money, and monopoly money is fake, while the US dollar has value. 

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.400
 So it is not like the rest. But the kids looked at the slide and they said, the gold coin is not like the rest 

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.600
 Because the rest are just piles of paper, and the gold coin is clearly a different thing. 

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.900
 So my question to the audience is who is the most intelligent? A five-year-old child or a university professor at the Evie League? 

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:39.700
 Before World War I, every coin issued by the Treasury was saying that 20 gold dollars were deposited - 

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.400
 In the United States Treasury payable to the bearer upon request. 

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:49.000
 The money was in the basement (treasury). And the coin was a receipt they gave you as a check. 

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:57.000
 Just a check for money (you can exchange it for money). As if you went to the clothes ironer, and gave him your shirt and he gives you a receipt for your shirt. 

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:03.900
 The value is, your shirt is cleaned. Not the piece of paper that says you own that shirt. 

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:11.100
 So our currency was traded .... the piece of US dollar, was just a check (receipt) for money. 

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.900
 The next hidden secret is the difference between currency and money. 

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:22.800
 Money must hold its value and maintain its purchasing power over long periods of time. 

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:29.300
 As we go through this chain, you'll know that national currencies are actually a tool used by the government - 

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:35.800
 And the financial sector, to absorb your time and freedom by stealing your purchasing power. 

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.300
 Instead of saving your economic energy, currencies waste it. 

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.770
 Now compare that to the gold and silver that the Egyptians were using. 

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.700
 As I said at the beginning of the episode, it has not become money yet because it is still not negotiable. 

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 But they were on the right track, as gold and silver had proven over thousands of years that it was a storehouse of value. 

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.600
 Gold only forms when a supernova explodes (the supernova), and remains forever. 

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.700
 This is one of the characteristics that make him ultimate money in the end. 

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:21.600
 You know, people are surprised that after 5,000 years, the pyramids are still there. 

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.200
 But what surprises me most is the coin that the people who built these pyramids used, 

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.900
 That coin, gold and silver that they used to trade on a daily basis, is still here today. 

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.000
 It may be melted and remake in the form of cash or a ribbon in a jewelry set. 

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.400
 But she is still with us today and is still buying something. 

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.800
 Yes, it is the money in the end because there is nothing else with the same rank. It is divisible. 

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.400
 It is permanent. It's a value keeper. 

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:08.200
 It's, uh, a unit of account. She has everything she wants from money, but she is weary and cannot be increased. 

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.600
 This is what makes gold the most beautiful money. What do you want more than money? 

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.300
 It keeps governments under control. You can maintain a liquidity system. 

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:29.600
 Governments do not like gold at the present time because they are going into paper currencies, and they will do everything in their power to discredit him as an asset (of value). 

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.100
 I mean, my God ... Gold has outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the past seven years. 

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.600
 But it is not considered a class of legitimate assets. Why? 

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.000
 Once again, it is the fear that gold will be imposed on the system. 

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.020
 In a way that restricts the government's ability to spend beyond its means. 

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.100
 They can not print it. 

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.700
 They cannot print it, no. . . Inflation 

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:01.800
 The correct definition of inflation, I use the definition of Milton Friedman (American economist, Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 1976). Inflation is the increase in currency stocks. 

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:10.000
 Deflation is the shrinking of currency stocks. If you increase the currency supply, eventually prices will rise. 

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.600
 And if you reduce the stock of the currency, the prices will decrease. 

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.200
 This is a basin. But not an aquarium. 

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.100
 This is the currency basin .... and these prices. 

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.900
 And if you increase the stock of the currency, then prices such as the sponge in the water must rise to absorb the excess currency. 

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.700
 Governments never stop printing more currency and adding it to the currency in circulation. 

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:45.800
 Therefore, prices continue to rise. Not because the things you are trying to buy change. 

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:52.200
 In fact, it does not change. What is changing is the purchasing power of the currency that has less and less. 

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.300
 The currency is falling. And it is not the prices that go up. 

00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:01.400
 The truth is, what we have now makes our world a big fake story. None of that is real. 

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:07.000
 It's all just promises. And if you think about that, about the way the currency started to spread. 

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.100
 You know, before we had a coin we had to barter. 

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.100
 I'll give you three pieces of coconut and you give me four fish ... this is a fair exchange ... coconut vs fish. 

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.500
 But that became complicated, so we had to invent this thing called money, so that it was divisible, a medium of exchange. 

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:27.300
 The challenge is that we lost it a long time ago. We lost things of value to be our currency. 

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.800
 Now we have these things named numbers and accounts. But trust me. 

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.850
 It is not real. It's a great made-up story. 

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.900
 One of the biggest fairy tales of all time, called Quantum Easing, which seems complicated, - 

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.600
 But it is really just a camouflage term for coin printing. 

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.600
 QE started with bank bailouts in 2009. 

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:55.600
 A coin was created out of nowhere, and then it was given to banks that paid themselves standard rewards for destroying the global economy. 

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.200
 This is a global phenomenon, but all you need to remember now is any of these processes: quantitative easing, rescue operations, or stimulus programs, - 

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:08.100
 These are all just sorcery, cheats, fraudulent operations, to increase currency printing. 

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:16.900
 I think gold and silver will impose themselves again as money and when this is done, there will not be enough of them. 

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:23.200
 And therefore their purchasing power will rise many, many, many, many times (i.e. 1 g of gold will buy you a house .... approx. P:). 

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:32.600
 Egypt is a wonderful place. There is something pleasant here, chaos is overwhelming. Especially traffic. 

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.560
 When it comes to merchants, they try to get every dime in your pocket, - 

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:46.700
 You are robbed until you return to your home with an empty wallet. 

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.400
 But do you know anything? They are amateurs compared to Wall Street. 

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.600
 In the past few years, I have spoken in many countries about the coming crisis, - 

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.300
 A lot of people think they will be fine in their country. 

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.900
 This will happen only in the United States or perhaps in the United States and Europe. 

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.550
 But what they do not realize is that this is a global phenomenon. 

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:20.600
 I'll show you something here. This ..... is the US currency reserve. 

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.700
 This is basically the number of paper dollars that exist. 

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:29.900
 It took 200 years to go from 0 dollars to 825 billion dollars. 

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:36.400
 And then we had the bank rescue, and then we had QE1, the first QE. 

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:46.500
 Then QE2. And then we had QE3 then QE4 and soon we would have QE57 and maybe QE382. 

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:53.600
 And, uh, that just doesn't happen here (United States). This is what the Canadian currency inventory looks like, for example. 

00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:00.500
 This is Australia. South Africa. Russia. 

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:10.000
 Now, this started in 2001, which is 18 times more currency, in just over a decade. 

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:17.100
 Here is Singapore. The same story. See that. Since the outbreak of the crisis, in days ... 

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.500
 India. China. Every government on earth - 

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:30.000
 You do the same thing, this crazy spending deficit (spending more than revenue) and inflating their currency, and then carrying out rescue operations. 

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.300
 And history shows that there is no example of this transformation. 

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:42.400
 It's surprising sometimes that we haven't seen more inflation than we currently have. 

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:49.300
 Since they are constantly increasing and constantly increasing the money supply (currency), why do our prices not rise faster than they actually do? 

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:55.200
 The answer is that a large portion of the money created by the Federal Reserve is exported abroad. 

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.500
 I remember at the beginning of my research that I heard this expression, "The Americans released their inflation !! -." 

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.100
 I thought ... what is this ?! How can you export your inflation? Put it in a box and send it? What do you do? 

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:13.400
 But now I understand. You export inflation simply by sending all these dollars that you have created to other countries - 

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.600
 Then they send you their refrigerators, cars, anything, and their TVs. 

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:26.200
 You get the devices and they get small pieces of paper. It is a great deal for the American people ... for a while. Briefly. 

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.000
 Sooner or later each of these baths :) will return home to perch. 

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:37.300
 When the time comes, and as it seems it is now, when the rest of the world says: Well .... We do not want to play this game anymore. 

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.500
 Uncle Sam's dollars are worthless. There are too many of them. 

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:48.000
 We found something other than US dollars. Then all those dollars begin to return to America. 

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.500
 People: We don't want it anymore. What will we do with it? 

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.740
 When those (dollars) begin to come back quickly, and a little bit of money has started coming back that we had previously issued, 

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:07.300
 When it becomes a flood and begins to rush back, then we restore our previous inflation that we exported. 

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.700
 Then we will see the amount of money inside the United States increasing more quickly even - 

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.000
 Of the Fed’s ability to print it, because we are getting our former money back. 

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.200
 And then we'll really see what a US dollar tank can buy. 

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.300
 During the second quantitative easing process, global food prices increased by 60%, - 

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:36.500
 This has led to a humanitarian catastrophe for the two billion people on Earth who live on less than two dollars a day. 

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:45.900
 Those people who were already hungry. They became more hungry, and some of them began to topple their governments in North Africa and the Middle East. 

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.100
 Therefore quantitative easing was the spark that ignited the Arab Spring. 

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.200
 That's it. When you create money, you have some kind of inflation. 

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.550
 It just depends on where the inflation goes. 

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:15.000
 Looking at the hypothesis that you have a permanent underclass or poor class and how inflation disproportionately affects them, 

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:22.900
 It mainly affects them in the proportion of their income that goes to food. 

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.800
 We look at that as a ratio, and we know there are risk points (critical threshold). 

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:33.800
 For example in Egypt recently, when that percentage reaches 40% of income, it goes for food - 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.800
 And the price of food goes up because of inflation, when it reaches 40%, this (is considered) historically a point where people will revolution. 

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:53.800
 This is exactly what we saw. The French Revolution was similarly because the prices of foodstuffs reached a certain critical point, where people simply found that profit and loss accounts were in favor of the revolution. 

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.450
 Well, it's true because when you have runaway inflation, it's a penalty for the most productive people in society. 

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.800
 In other words, people who produce more than consume and save the difference. 

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.890
 The problem is that these productive people, and savers, save money in the national currency - 

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.900
 Unfortunately the national currency is just a piece of official paper at this point. 

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:32.300
 So when the currency collapses during runaway inflation, the $ 100,000 that you were hoping to rely on after retirement no longer exists. 

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.100
 And the things that you would buy with those dollars and save them for others would not exist either, what would you do now? 

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:49.200
 So ... everything looks very scary. However, as you know, this is what will happen, and you must act rationally. 

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.500
 But the great news is that gold and silver are always accountable (trial) for currency inflation. 

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.600
 It is basically the will of the people and free markets. 

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.700
 When governments do this kind of thing to stockpile their currency, they devalue it, and ultimately it turns into inflation. 

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:11.800
 People feel losing their purchasing power. Because they rush back to gold and silver, and the value increases - 

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.900
 Gold and silver in the country until it reaches or exceeds the value of all the currency in circulation. 

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:24.500
 This process has occurred time and time again throughout history, but this time it happens on a global scale. 

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.100
 Never before in all countries. 

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.400
 This means that this is the greatest transfer of wealth in history. 

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:40.200
 So it is the greatest opportunity in history and it will never happen again in your life. 

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.100
 We have learned that your true wealth is your time and freedom. 

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:55.800
 Money is the trading tool that stores economic energy, which is your time and freedom while currencies leak. 

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.600
 Gold and silver are simply absolute money because of their properties. 

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:05.600
 And paper currencies depend on trust only and always return to their true value .... zero. 

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:13.200
 Governments do not like gold because it imposes restrictions on it. High prices are a symptom of currency inflation - 

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.500
 Gold and silver will always eliminate the inflation. 

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:25.200
 So that's it for this episode. Join me in the next episode. We'll see how the history of the financial system is only repeated. 

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.200
 And how gold and silver always win the battle between currency and money. 

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.700
 Until then, my challenge for you is to stop calling the coin money. 

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.300
 It is the decisive first step to freeing your mind from all this hypocrisy and economic sorcery and changing your life. 

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.100
 You can learn more by watching the additional paragraphs on our site and if you have any questions you can ask there - 

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.100
 We will answer some of your questions in additional paragraphs in the future. 

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.700
 So ..... Good luck. thanks for watching. And we'll see you next time. 

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.300
 good morning. 

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.900
 Fabulous. 

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.100
 What does "paper currency" mean? 

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.800
 It's the Latin word for "very bad car." 

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.800
 I am in the desert and wearing a suit. 

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:28.700
 My camel died. 

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.520
 Not sure about this? Huh? 

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.800
 I'm ready for ...., a long nap. 

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.800
 Hello, welcome to this additional paragraph for the first episode of Hidden Secrets of Money, and- 

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.500
 And its title is Currency for Money. So this is the main theme.
