00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.950
MICHAEL KIRK - Let’s start in Dresden.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.210
Who is that man in Dresden?

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.849
MASHA GESSEN - Well, he’s an unhappy man.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.900
He has wanted to be a secret agent all of
his life, as long as he can remember, and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.650
he was—waited patiently for his foreign
posting.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.160
Then he gets posted to East Germany, and not
even to Berlin, to Dresden, which is just

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.890
such a backwater, and his job in Dresden isn't
even to spy on the East Germans.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.550
His job in Dresden is actually to try to work
remotely to get intelligence from the West.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.480
So he’s working with students in Dresden
who might have friends who are students in

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.760
Berlin, and his big “get” during his entire
time in Dresden is buying a 700-page unclassified

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.640
U.S. Army manual.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.080
That’s all he’s managed to do.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.820
Another thing that’s happened to him is
that he’s experienced envy like I think

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.220
he didn’t expect.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.750
The fact that he recounted it nearly 20 years
later, when he was already a wealthy man,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:25.130
but you know, they got to Dresden, and East
Germany was not terribly exciting or glamorous

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.580
or wealthy place by any means, especially
Dresden, which had been, you know, virtually

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.410
destroyed in the bombings in 1945.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:40.610
So here is this bland city, and still he sees
that East Germans, ordinary East Germans live

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.620
better than a KGB officer in the Soviet Union.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.409
They all have their own separate apartments.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.549
They have washing machines in their apartments.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.880
They have color televisions.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.910
All these things are luxury in the Soviet
Union.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.700
He grew up in a communal apartment.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.659
His parents still live in a communal apartment.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.130
He’s never had a washing machine in the
house, an automatic washing machine, that

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.130
sort of thing.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.970
So he’s a very unhappy man.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.459
He’s drinking a lot of beer, getting fat
and wiling away his time uselessly.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.439
Meanwhile, back home, things start happening
as soon as he left the country.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.779
The country started to transform, which is
something that no one could have predicted,

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:32.779
because it felt, you know, that era in Soviet
history is known as the era of stagnation.

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.189
It just felt like time had stopped.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.590
People were living in sort of horizontal time.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.180
There was no future; there was no past.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.779
Things were always going to be the same.

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:53.939
And suddenly Mikhail Gorbachev, who’s the
new head of the Central Committee, the first

00:02:53.939 --> 00:03:00.220
sort of young person—he’s in his 50s—to
have that post in generations, he comes out

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.280
and says: “We need change.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.670
We need transformation.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.670
We need perestroika.”

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.709
He says that word, and “glasnost.”

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.930
“Perestroika” is restructuring, and “glasnost”
is transparency.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.549
And it actually begins.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.150
At first, for people in the West, it seemed
like so much hot air, and the system really

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.279
couldn’t be transformed.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:31.370
And Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote this scathing
book about how the Soviet Union could never

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.749
be transformed; it could only bring its own
collapse on, which turned out to be a prescient

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:37.749
book.

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:43.829
But people in the Soviet Union are completely
caught up in the excitement of change, because

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.239
suddenly things can be said, things can be
done.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.389
Things that were unthinkable yesterday are
entirely normal today, like having a demonstration

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.370
in the street, which first people sort of
tried gingerly, and then they see that people

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.359
aren't getting arrested, and then all of a
sudden, there are thousands and hundreds of

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.569
thousands of people in the streets.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.139
All of that excitement and all of that discussion
that’s starting to happen out in public,

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.989
like “What should the state be like?

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:19.520
Should there be one party, or maybe more than
one party?,” That’s a radical idea; all

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.920
of that is happening back in the Soviet Union,
and Putin has no way of knowing about it.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.520
MICHAEL KIRK - We’re going to get back there,
but let’s go just quickly back into a little

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520
back story.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.050
When I read the books about him, they always
say at 16 he wanted to join the KGB.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.790
It isn't until he’s 23 that he does, but
he walked by the building every day and saw

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.790
it or something.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.790
How much of any of that is true?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.290
And I think you say that his dad was actually
a KGB agent.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.000
MASHA GESSEN - His dad was actually in the
NKVD [People’s Commissariat for Internal

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Affairs].

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.240
NKVD was the precursor to the KGB, at the
start of the war, the start of World War II.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.500
This is something that’s very much a part
of Putin’s personal mythology, and he’s

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.740
pedaled the story more and more as time has
gone on.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.479
We have no way of knowing if it’s true.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.830
I would assume that it’s true.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.490
I would assume that he was indeed in NKVD
at the start of the war.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.310
The thing about the Russian secret police
and the Soviet secret police is that one never

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.000
leaves the secret police.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.520
Once a KGB man, always a KGB man.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.190
It seems that probably Putin’s father maintained
some connection to the secret police throughout

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.780
his life.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.410
One sign of that is that they had a telephone,
and people didn’t have telephones in the

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.080
Soviet Union in the 1950s.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.129
Very rarely would a communal apartment have
a telephone, and never would somebody have

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:58.699
a personal phone inside a communal apartment,
which is what Putin’s dad had.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.009
So he was possibly on active duty.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.410
He was possibly on what's called active reserve,
which is what Putin himself was for a little

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.240
bit after he returned from Dresden.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.900
But it’s basically when somebody doesn’t
have—when the KGB doesn’t have a job to

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.610
give you, but they keep you on the payroll,
and you keep coming back and sort of snitching

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.710
on whatever workplace you were actually in.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.960
MICHAEL KIRK - When you talk about a communal
apartment, maybe you could describe it.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.800
I know that, as a boy, he liked to play in
the courtyard.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.330
This is the version of it that some people
tell us.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.440
He liked to play in the courtyard and define
himself—he was a slight boy—by judo and

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440
other things.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.110
But it was a kind of rough-and-tumble world,
I gather.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.150
Could you help us understand that?

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.600
MASHA GESSEN - Communal apartments, especially
in St. Petersburg, or Leningrad at the time,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.969
were this very weird thing.

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:58.940
St. Petersburg, under the czars, had been
a grand city.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.340
It was a planned city, and it had—there
were all these Parisian architects who had

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.590
been brought in to build the apartment buildings
in the center of town.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:19.249
So they had these vast lavish apartments that
were broken up after the revolution, in the

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:28.139
first few years after the 1917 revolution,
so that the rich were either exiled or killed

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:33.439
or imprisoned, or in some cases, just forced
to occupy one room out of what had been seven

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:35.830
or 15 rooms in this communal apartment.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:41.780
Putin grew up in one of those apartments that
had been, two generations before he was born,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:49.220
had been opulent but now was dilapidated.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.639
Putin was born seven years after World War
II ended.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:58.629
During World War II, Leningrad was under siege
for 900 days.

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:04.729
A million people died of starvation; at least
a million people died of starvation.

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:11.220
And the city itself was constantly shelled.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.449
One wonderful Russian writer who did an oral
history of the siege had this phrase that

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:19.050
“It’s like living in St. Petersburg after
the war.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:25.240
Living in Leningrad after the war is like,
if soldiers had never left the trenches after

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.169
the war ended, and just continued to live
there.”

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:33.700
I mean, they lived where it had all happened,
where people had died, where they had struggled

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.320
to survive.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.640
Most people had lost family members, often
the entire families.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.220
They had seen their neighbors die.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.740
They may have eaten their neighbors after
they died.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.980
MICHAEL KIRK - Eaten?

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.620
MASHA GESSEN - Yes, eaten.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.500
There's a lot of cannibalism.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.780
And they also, you know, burned their books,
their furniture, their window frames, to keep

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.130
warm.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:07.740
These were these buildings that had been shelled,
that had been disassembled by their residents

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:15.831
for firewood, that were being heated with
these tiny little wood-burning stoves, one

00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:17.490
per room sort of thing.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:24.630
That’s where Putin was born, and in a town—in
a city that was still scarred in all these

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.270
different ways.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.560
It was also a period of extreme poverty throughout
the Soviet Union.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.910
Basically, people were always on the edge
of subsistence.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.300
Food was scarce.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.300
All goods were scarce.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.690
There was also no child care.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.850
People worked six days a week.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.880
There was no state-subsidized child care.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.010
There was no retirement.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:59.600
The retirement benefits were introduced for
the secret police in the 1950s and for everybody

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.280
else much later.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.060
Children were basically left to their own
devices.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.190
Putin’s parents worked pretty much around
the clock, his mother various unskilled jobs,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.460
his father at a factory.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.230
And he was left to his own devices.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.640
He hung out in the courtyard with other boys,
like all children did.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.560
And he was often picked upon and bullied until
he started studying Sambo, which was a Soviet

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.640
version of martial arts, and then later switched
to judo so he could compete.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.040
MICHAEL KIRK - What is the composite of that
character who comes up out of there and finds

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.770
himself in Dresden?

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:46.010
MASHA GESSEN - He’s scrappy, very ambitious,
very, very greedy.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.540
This is actually an extraordinary trait of
his, something that he has talked about.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:57.320
He doesn’t call it greed, but the behavior
he describes is so atypical for a Soviet boy

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.480
or a young man that it really stands out.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:06.750
There aren't a lot of things that are extraordinary
about Putin, but his greed is truly extraordinary.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.940
He describes a couple incidents.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.940
...

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.860
One is, is he had a wristwatch as a kid.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:19.561
Now, even when I was growing up, and I'm 15
years younger, a wrist—and I come from a

00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:25.420
much more privileged background—a wristwatch
for a kid was something that just you didn’t

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.080
see, and certainly not a little kid.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.870
A wristwatch was a luxury.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.260
It was a luxury object, and he had one.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:41.080
We don’t know the provenance of the wristwatch,
but the fact that he got it, which probably

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:47.170
means that his father gave it to him and didn’t
have a wristwatch himself, shows a very skewed

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:53.130
and unusual relationship, both for material
things and between sort of child and his parent.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:58.260
The second story is, when he was in college,
he got a very well-paying summer job building

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:04.220
up in the far north, which was not unusual
for Soviet college students, boys.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.060
So he made a lot of money.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.690
The first summer he did it, he went to Crimea
afterward and spent all that money.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:21.880
Normally a young man from a not well-off family
would give most of that money, and often all

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.200
of that money, to his parents.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.350
It would be their—the money that they would
eat on for the rest of the year, and he went

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.290
and blew it all on vodka and entertainment
in Crimea.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.230
The second year, he says that he learned his
lesson.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.770
He didn’t blow the money.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:45.430
He returned to St. Petersburg with the money
and bought himself a beautiful overcoat and

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.540
a cake for his mother.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:57.040
And again, that incredible disbalance between
the luxurious object that he got for himself

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:03.190
and a cake for his mother shows a very strange
relationship with his parents.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:09.180
The third story is that his parents won a
car in a lottery.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:16.830
There was a single Soviet lottery that a lot
of people, most people played; sometimes some

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.630
people would get lucky.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.320
You could take the car, or you could take
cash.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.610
If his parents had taken cash, it would have
been enough to get them out of the communal

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.510
apartment and into a place of their own, which
was every Soviet citizen’s dream.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.820
But they took the car, and they gave it to
their son, a college student.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:40.130
I'm quite certain that he was the only college
student in Leningrad in the 1970s who had

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.190
his own car.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.490
MICHAEL KIRK - What's up with the relationship?

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:48.700
You must have asked lots of people and thought
about it long and hard yourself.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.170
What is up with that?

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:55.440
MASHA GESSEN - Well, that’s all conjecture.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.810
But he was born to his parents very late.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.490
He was a miracle baby.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.440
His parents were in their early 40s.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.580
They had lived through the siege of Leningrad.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:11.620
His father had been disabled in the war, and
his mother had nearly died of starvation.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:18.320
They had lost a son during the war to starvation,
and they had lost another son before the war

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.160
to a childhood illness.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:29.360
So for them to be an intact couple in which
both parents, both people survived the siege,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.810
that was already a miracle.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:37.840
It was something you almost didn’t see in
Leningrad after the war.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:45.360
Then for them to be able to have a child in
their early 40s would have been nothing short

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.770
of a miracle.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:55.260
He may well have been the only child born
to a couple of survivors in their 40s in 1950s

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.020
Leningrad.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:02.510
So we can only imagine that it affected their
relationship in some unusual way.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.390
MICHAEL KIRK - Well, it makes him feel, in
some way, magical and entitled.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.410
MASHA GESSEN - Right, chosen.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.680
MICHAEL KIRK - Chosen.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.680
Chosen.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.780
Any proof of that, that he feels that he’s
chosen?

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:21.340
MASHA GESSEN - Yes, there's a lot of proof
that he feels that he is chosen now, now that

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.840
he is president.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:32.600
I think that his unusual path to the presidency,
the fact that he was an accidental president,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.920
actually makes him feel more like he was chosen—because
we don’t actually believe in accidents as

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.920
humans.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.670
We always think there's a reason for something
happening.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:47.190
MICHAEL KIRK - I make lots of films about
famous presidents and leaders of agencies,

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:56.180
and the idea that there's somebody who has
“chosen” as a character trait is astonishing

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.070
and wonderful.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:05.300
So let’s deal with KGB volunteer at 16 years
of age.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.300
True story?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.840
MASHA GESSEN - I mean, there's no way to corroborate
this.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.390
The way that I've always treated it is that
Putin is highly unusual in that before he

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:23.160
became the prime minister of Russia, he had
no public life, so he had a chance to create

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.920
his own image.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.280
I think it’s actually very important to
know what he wants to communicate, what kind

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.450
of image he wants to project.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.850
In a sense, it’s more important than what
actually happened.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.130
This is what he wants us to know about himself.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.950
He wants us to know that at 16, he went to
volunteer for the KGB.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.370
Whether it actually happened is immaterial.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:51.900
He is the kind of guy who, at 50, wanted people
to think that at 16 he volunteered to be in

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.900
the KGB.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.300
MICHAEL KIRK - Great.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.300
OK.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:01.520
So now we’re back at Dresden, and he’s
missed glasnost and perestroika.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:10.970
Let’s dispel or deal with another rumor,
“Moscow is silent” and the shoveling of

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.510
documents into a stove so much that the stove
cracks and breaks.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.240
Again, more of the myth-making?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.280
MASHA GESSEN - Again, we don’t know, right?

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.370
This is a story that he tells.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.140
It’s a story that’s clearly very important
to him.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.050
It’s his memory that he owns.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.740
Whether it’s based on real events, we have
no idea.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.860
I mean, it’s definitely true that there
were a lot of demonstrations in East Germany

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.360
at the time, and especially in Dresden.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:44.480
Dresden was a city that the railway went through,
so a lot of Hungarian refugees were going

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:53.160
through on the trains through Dresden to West
Germany after West Germany started taking

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.350
refugees and Hungary opened the border.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.950
Dresden was sort of a key place in that sense.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.420
And it’s definitely true that there were
huge demonstrations.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:09.110
Now, what Putin tells us is that during one
of those demonstrations, people were outside

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.940
the KGB building where he worked, and he was
afraid they were going to storm the building,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.560
and then he went out on the porch and addressed
them and said that he had every right to be

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.710
there, although he said he was an interpreter.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.260
He didn’t say he was an officer.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:32.860
Then he called the local Red Army outpost
and asked them to send security, and they

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:38.730
said, “We can't do that without orders from
Moscow, and Moscow is silent.”

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:45.120
He then went and started burning documents
that they had in this KGB building, and he

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.770
burnt them in the furnace until the furnace
cracked from the heat.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.730
That’s the story as he tells it.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.990
I think the important elements for him in
this story are sort of three.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:04.350
One is that he’s afraid of public protest,
and that’s demonstrably true.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.060
He is terrified of people in the streets.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:18.760
The other is that he felt betrayed by the
Soviet Union as a KGB agent in Germany.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:24.950
I think that that’s the reason that he keeps
returning to this sort of origin story, is

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:31.390
that it partly explains his understanding
of the collapse of the Soviet Union as the

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:36.020
greatest geopolitical catastrophe of our time,
as he’d have said.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.340
And number three is that he is loyal.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:46.890
Moscow had betrayed him, the Red Army had
betrayed him, but there he was, burning documents

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:53.190
to the last for some reason that only he could
actually deduce.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.760
But it’s very clearly a story about how
he continued to do his duty, even though he

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.760
could have walked away.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.150
I mean, clearly understand that he could have
just shut the door or padlocked the door and

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:11.320
joined the protesters, right, but he continued
doing his job even after the Kremlin had abdicated.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:16.690
MICHAEL KIRK - There's this film that he apparently
watched all the time, again, another part

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:22.530
of the story, The Shield and the Sword or
whatever it is.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.940
And by the time—it doesn’t matter.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:34.300
But I think it’s remarkable the way he has
invented a sort of him that explains the him

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.200
that will live in the world in his 50s and
early 60s.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.030
MASHA GESSEN - Well, we all do it.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.280
MICHAEL KIRK - Well, not me.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.280
(Laughs.)

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.980
No, I'm sure that’s true.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:55.110
But it, in this case, manifests itself in
some amazing ways, which we’ll get to.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:21:01.810
One of the things we seem to be sort of discovering
is, he and all the KGB people that supposedly

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:08.970
leave in the collapse of the Soviet Union,
800,000 men and women who disappear or who

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:14.260
fall out of their jobs, are kind of—the
word we keep coming up with is “shipwrecked.”

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.920
They're just out there somewhere, right?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920
MASHA GESSEN - Right.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.220
MICHAEL KIRK - He lands in Leningrad and then
St. Petersburg.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.270
I don’t know how much time we need to spend
in this territory as we get him up to the

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.920
FSB [Federal Security Service] in Moscow.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:34.930
But is there something about the era, the
place, the time, other than the documentary

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:40.809
he has made about himself at that time, that
is relevant and important for us to know about?

00:21:40.809 --> 00:21:47.130
MASHA GESSEN - Well, the important thing is
that he stayed in the KGB.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.440
He returned to Leningrad.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.870
He got a job.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.610
And this was a classic KGB posting.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:57.740
He got a job as the man in charge of foreign
relations for the university at the time.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:03.200
Very sensitive posting at the time, because
universities were just starting to open up

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.390
to foreign students, foreign teachers, foreign
exchange programs, so of course you needed

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.490
a KGB man to oversee all of that.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:17.160
He was in that position not for very long,
and then he takes another classic KGB posting,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:23.740
which is being an assistant to an official,
who was one of the first elected officials

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.180
in the country.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.640
Leningrad was the first city in the country
to hold elections to its city council.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.600
It’s a very large legislature.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.760
It’s a huge city.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.070
It’s 5 million people and a very exciting
election.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.700
They were really trying sort of radical democracy
at the time.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:46.730
They wanted a leaderless city council, some
of them, and direct democracy of all kinds.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.450
It was really beautiful.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:57.060
[Anatoly] Sobchak, the mayor, emerged as a
kind of centrist.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.490
He had been a member of the Communist Party,
unlike some of the new democrats.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:08.490
He had very much been a member of the establishment,
a professor at the university.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:14.809
It means that his ideological credentials
had passed muster with the Communist Party.

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:21.690
Now he’s a democrat, but not as radical
as some of these Leningrad direct-democracy

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.559
advocates and that sort of thing.

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:32.710
He is able to get sort of the more conventional
communist constituency and the new democratic

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.720
constituency, so he gets elected by the city
council to be mayor, and Putin becomes his

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.490
assistant.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.550
He served as his deputy up until 1996.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.860
Now he was in charge of the city’s foreign
business.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.960
Again, that would be something that would
be a logical sort of place to plug a KGB man

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.940
into, but also, in all fairness, probably
a job that he could navigate better than many

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.940
other people.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.700
He had been abroad; he had been trained in
talking to foreigners.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:11.910
So it makes sense that his skills would appeal
to someone like Sobchak.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:21.080
Sobchak wrote in his memoirs that he was fully
aware that Putin was with the KGB, and he

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.790
implied that he preferred to pick his own
KGB agent rather than have one sent to him.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.880
MICHAEL KIRK - But wait a minute.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.040
I thought the KGB was disbanded.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.060
MASHA GESSEN - … Right, right.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.710
The KGB was not disbanded.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:41.230
After the failed August 1991 coup, Yeltsin
gave orders, or actually forced Gorbachev

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:47.020
to give an order to the new director of the
KGB, who replaced the one who had organized

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.870
the coup, to disband the KGB.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.330
This new man had four months to work on it,
four months that the Soviet Union remained

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:01.850
legally an entity, and all he succeeded in
doing was breaking it up into 15 different

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.830
KGBs, for each of the constituent republics
of the Soviet Union.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.110
MICHAEL KIRK - … So here he is, he’s made
the—

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.860
MASHA GESSEN - Maybe we should then mention
the embezzlement in St. Petersburg.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.100
MICHAEL KIRK - In the food?

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.100
MASHA GESSEN - Yes.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.290
MICHAEL KIRK - Yes, OK, let’s go do that.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.650
We’re back in Leningrad.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:28.130
MASHA GESSEN - So as the deputy to the new
elected mayor in 1991, Putin has to administer

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.360
this weird program.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.190
The new Russian government, the new government
of the independent Russia, was terrified that

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:42.059
people were going to starve, because food
shortages had become so profound that they

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:49.080
had no way of basically ensuring that the
population would have enough food to not start

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.790
starving.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:26:02.450
And they decided to issue different regions
of Russia permissions to use strategic reserves

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.450
to exchange for food imports.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:10.790
At the time, the ruble was not convertible,
so they couldn’t give them money to buy

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.790
food.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:17.100
But they could tell them, “You have timber
or precious metals,” or whatever else they

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:25.130
had in that particular city, “that you can
use to procure food for your city’s population

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.679
to prevent starvation.”

00:26:26.679 --> 00:26:34.660
Putin had $100,000 worth of those credits
that he could use, and he had to create a

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:42.540
system for exchanging timber, in that case,
timber and metals for food.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:48.490
He created a system that never delivered any
food.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:56.230
But the city council, when it began investigating
what had happened, concluded that he had purposely

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:07.450
created companies with faulty contracts that
could not be enforced so that the company

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:17.059
could basically write off a loss, and the
city could never demand reparations because

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:29.080
the contracts were purposely 
constructed in such a way as to prevent enforcement.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:37.090
The city council investigation concluded that
Putin needed to be prosecuted, but that required

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:46.550
an order from the mayor to allow the prosecution
of his deputy.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:51.420
Instead of allowing that, the mayor actually
disbanded the city council and proceeded to

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.580
govern by decree for about a year and a half.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.280
MICHAEL KIRK - So much for democracy, yes?

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.480
MASHA GESSEN - Right.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.750
MICHAEL KIRK - Fledgling democracy, strangled,
drowned, whatever you do with it.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:12.730
So how do his characteristics manifest themselves
as he’s made the head of the FSB in Moscow?

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:20.091
MASHA GESSEN - Unsurprisingly, we know the
least about his time as head of the FSB, except

00:28:20.091 --> 00:28:28.429
that he was a bit of an outsider there, even
though he was a career KGB man.

00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:32.720
He was a colonel, or actually a lieutenant
colonel, when he was promoted to head of the

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.130
FSB.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:39.070
He felt that he wasn’t trusted and that
he didn’t trust the men there.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:45.740
He held his meetings in a disused elevator
shaft in the FSB building because he was afraid

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.250
of being wiretapped.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:50.490
That's about all we know.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.130
So not—he wasn’t a reformer.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:29:00.040
He didn’t leave a trace on the FSB except
for that, that funny story about taking his

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.730
meetings in the elevator shaft.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.830
MICHAEL KIRK - And that was with [Boris] Berezovsky,
right—

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.850
MASHA GESSEN - That was with Berezovsky.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:13.340
MICHAEL KIRK - —who plays a central role
in the ascension of Vladimir Putin.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.530
MASHA GESSEN - Right.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:21.400
Berezovsky was an oligarch who fancied himself
a kingmaker.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:27.400
There was this sort of phenomenon of men who
had become very, very wealthy, very, very

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.690
quickly, in the 1990s, because they were smart
and well-placed.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:35.820
Berezovsky was one of them, and that really
went to his head.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.220
He was a masterful sort of bluffer.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:44.250
He would buy a minority stake in a company
and then pretend that he owned the whole company

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.430
and proceed to give orders, and people would
believe him.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:54.310
I think he felt a little bit like that with
the whole country, and Yeltsin seemed to like

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.890
him and trust him.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.670
He made him the head of his Security Council
at one point.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:05.170
He was very much part of Yeltsin’s inner
circle, what was called “The Family,”

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:15.360
even as Yeltsin alienated everybody else,
and Berezovsky lobbied for Putin as a successor

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.570
to Yeltsin.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.840
Yeltsin needed a handpicked successor because
he was afraid of being prosecuted in case

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.470
the opposition took power after his second
term was over.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:29.020
He was a very different kind of man [as compared]
to Putin.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.420
I don’t think he considered the possibility
of, say, canceling elections and going for

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.010
a third term, something that Putin has done.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:43.630
He is now in his third term—although he
hasn’t canceled elections, but he’s fiddled

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.110
with the constitution in all sorts of creative
ways.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.380
But Yeltsin wasn’t like that, but he certainly
didn’t want to go to prison.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:59.790
The idea was that they would put somebody
they could play in the president’s chair,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:06.059
someone loyal, who would prevent Yeltsin’s
prosecution.

00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:11.961
Because I think Berezovsky fancied himself
so much a kingmaker, he didn’t consider

00:31:11.961 --> 00:31:18.990
the fact that picking a KGB man for this job
might be dangerous, or anybody else.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.340
I think he just thought it was such a brilliant
scheme.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.290
Here he was; he pulled this guy out of obscurity
and made him president.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:32.669
MICHAEL KIRK - And the man he pulls out of
obscurity, a lot of people I've talked to,

00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:36.419
and a lot of things I've read, this man is—everyone
says: “I met him.

00:31:36.419 --> 00:31:37.720
He was sort of gray.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.970
He was sort of boring.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:45.010
He was completely unobtrusive,” or “He
was a kind of BSer who would bring flowers

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:52.250
to people and just self-aggrandizing in lots
of ways.”

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.320
Is that the man that Berezovsky moves up?

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:01.940
MASHA GESSEN - Berezovsky perceived him as
a decent man, for some reason.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.700
When I asked Berezovsky about it, he said,
“Well, there was one time that I needed

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.230
to open an office in St. Petersburg, and Putin
didn’t take a bribe.”

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:16.040
I mean, that is a pretty low benchmark, especially
because we have plenty of information about

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.799
Putin taking bribes under other circumstances.

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:26.130
And then, at another time, when Berezovsky
was sort of on the outs with the power elites,

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:31.990
Putin brought flowers to his wife’s birthday
party.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:38.070
Loyalty is very much sort of something that
he cultivates as a part of his image, and

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:42.150
that’s something that Berezovsky also valued.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:50.030
It’s a very Soviet trait, especially Soviet
male trait, to value loyalty in a country

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.660
that had sort of given up all principles as
such.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:59.330
Personal loyalty was very much the currency
of public men.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:07.559
Other than that, there was nothing to say
about this man, not that he was smart, not

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:12.679
that he was skilled, not that he had any kind
of relevant experience, not that he was liked

00:33:12.679 --> 00:33:13.679
or likable.

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:19.660
I mean, he spoke a foreign language, which
made him sort of European.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.530
He wasn’t a drunk, unlike Yeltsin, which
was a relief.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.750
But that’s about it.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:30.919
Then everybody projected onto him whatever
they wanted to.

00:33:30.919 --> 00:33:34.419
People projected onto him this idea that he
was going to be a democrat and an economic

00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:39.640
reformer, and the American press ran with
those projections.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.910
MICHAEL KIRK - Why?

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.220
Because we were hungry for that?

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:49.660
We wanted to believe that having the Soviet
Union having collapsed, it was now—and we

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.320
had spent so much money and time and energy
in the Yeltsin years, that we had really started

00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:00.000
something, and the green shoots of democracy
were finally yielding a new, young Russia?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.130
MASHA GESSEN - I think so.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:09.460
I think that American correspondents and foreign
correspondents tend to sort of perpetuate

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460
narratives.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:19.739
And the Russia narrative was the victory of
democracy, the end of history, the triumph

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.079
of popular will, that sort of thing.

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:30.849
So a young guy who speaks a foreign language
fits into that narrative, as long as you ignore

00:34:30.849 --> 00:34:31.849
everything else about him.

00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:36.179
MICHAEL KIRK - Well, you wrote this amazing,
this wonderful little sentence about him being

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:43.790
sleek and trim and in European-cut suits,
and it made him look like, you know, the way

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.720
Pierre Trudeau used to look in Canada.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:53.979
MASHA GESSEN - I wouldn’t go quite as far
as Pierre Trudeau, but yes, he had a way about

00:34:53.979 --> 00:34:58.680
him that seemed different from those Central
Committee men.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.920
Yeltsin was also not quite a Central Committee
man, but he did wear these gray suits, baggy

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.920
gray suits.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:14.200
They were like the Politburo-cut suit, and
Putin had a different cut of suit.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.289
What's interesting is that now he wears those
baggy suits with pants that are like eight

00:35:19.289 --> 00:35:22.559
inches too long, but he didn’t used to.

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:25.230
He actually, he wore these expensive, well-cut
suits.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.109
MICHAEL KIRK - He is an information warrior
in that sense.

00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:31.079
He’s making an image, as you already articulated.

00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:36.470
He’s making an image of himself that’s
almost like—you're right; he creates a numina-like

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.960
effect about himself, and then we can all
project onto him whatever we want.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:46.990
MASHA GESSEN - I don’t know how willful
it is, because actually, the interviews that

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:54.890
he gave when he was acting president—so
Yeltsin resigned on Dec. 31, 1999, making

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.270
Putin the fairly new prime minister.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:03.759
He’d only been in office for four months,
making him the acting president, and a shoo-in

00:36:03.759 --> 00:36:06.170
in an early presidential election.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:11.359
That was very much part of the idea of resigning
on Dec. 31.

00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:19.609
But Putin still has no public persona, so
a media team was assembled very quickly, and

00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:23.130
he sat down for interviews with them six times,
with three journalists, [Nataliya Gevorkyan,

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.130
Natalya Timakova and Andrei Kolesnikov].

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:28.359
They wrote a book that’s still available
called First Person.

00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:32.809
And if you read that book closely, there's
nothing in there about his being a European.

00:36:32.809 --> 00:36:36.940
There's nothing in there about his appreciation
for democracy.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:45.479
Basically, he’s projecting one main myth
about himself, which is that he’s a thug.

00:36:45.479 --> 00:36:49.200
The story that he keeps telling over and over
again, and that his friends tell, the sort

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:57.839
of the vetted stories by friends in the book,
are all stories about Putin getting into fights,

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:00.619
and they all unfold according to the same
scenario.

00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:08.400
He lashes out when he feels wronged, and then
he quiets down, and everybody thinks it’s

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.400
over.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.279
And then, when they least expect it, he lunges
again.

00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:15.479
MICHAEL KIRK - And Masha, what did that tell
you about him?

00:37:15.479 --> 00:37:22.229
MASHA GESSEN - Well, this is a story about
a man who is vengeful, and he wants us to

00:37:22.229 --> 00:37:25.249
know that he is vengeful.

00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:31.450
And he’s aggressive, and he’s reckless,
because he talks about how he got into a fight

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.849
like that as a young officer.

00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:39.880
He got into a street fight over—I don’t
remember—the tram ticket or something like

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.900
that, a bus ticket.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.480
And he points out that he was risking his
career.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:53.560
If as a KGB officer it had been discovered
that he got into a street brawl, that would

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.880
have probably killed his chances for a foreign
posting.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:05.369
He has so much trouble controlling his temper,
that he will risk everything that he’s worked

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:11.269
for in life for an opportunity to vengefully
lash out.

00:38:11.269 --> 00:38:14.239
MICHAEL KIRK - That’s at least the story
he wants to tell.

00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:17.910
MASHA GESSEN - That’s the story he wants
to tell, and he’s certainly acted in accordance

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:18.910
with that.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:19.980
MICHAEL KIRK - Exactly right.…

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:26.190
I mean, he’s basically creating an image
all the way along about himself, which is

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.510
very interesting.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.589
We passed by when he’s at the FSB [Federal
Security Service] a story that I don’t want

00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:36.220
to spend very much time on, because we just
can't, and it’s unknown, which is the apartment

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.220
bombings.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.690
Unknown whether he had a hand in it.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:45.539
… regardless of whether he did it or not,
he certainly took advantage of this sad occasion

00:38:45.539 --> 00:38:48.880
of the bombing of those apartments.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.089
Tell me how he took advantage of it.

00:38:51.089 --> 00:38:58.440
MASHA GESSEN - Within three weeks of his appointment
as prime minister, a series of terrorist attacks

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.910
starts happening in Russia.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:09.789
First there are small sort of incidents, and
then there are several large apartment bombings

00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:12.720
in the south of Russia and then in Moscow.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:18.979
Especially the ones in Moscow are just shocking
to the country.

00:39:18.979 --> 00:39:23.130
The country at the time I think felt very
much—it so happens that I was there during

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:30.599
those bombings, and then I was here in New
York on 9/11, and I think the mood was largely

00:39:30.599 --> 00:39:39.779
similar—because the spectacle of all of
it, right, the fact that these bombs went

00:39:39.779 --> 00:39:47.849
off in the wee hours of the morning, so everybody’s
home asleep in their beds.

00:39:47.849 --> 00:39:55.789
And these large apartment blocks just folded
in on themselves, burying these people alive

00:39:55.789 --> 00:39:59.859
or dead, but burying everybody in the building.

00:39:59.859 --> 00:40:06.859
The fact that these were just standard apartment
blocks, so so many people in Russia, watching

00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:12.690
that on television, could imagine themselves
so easily in their beds, because those beds

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:15.369
were just like their beds, and those buildings
were just like their buildings, and those

00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:20.289
families were just like their families, right?

00:40:20.289 --> 00:40:25.640
These were clearly explosions designed for
the maximum number of casualties.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:31.099
That’s why you would have a bomb go off
at like 5:00 in the morning, right, when no

00:40:31.099 --> 00:40:36.880
one has gotten up yet, but everyone has already
come home who’s going to come home, and

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.430
everyone has gone to bed.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:43.999
All of Russia, I think, identified with the
people who died.

00:40:43.999 --> 00:40:45.790
Everybody was afraid.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.079
Everybody was in shock.

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:55.869
People started watching out for strangers,
anybody who might be planting explosives in

00:40:55.869 --> 00:40:58.329
their buildings.

00:40:58.329 --> 00:41:03.279
And then suddenly Putin emerges, this prime
minister that most people don’t even remember

00:41:03.279 --> 00:41:08.430
his name because there have been so many prime
ministers in the last couple years, and this

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:11.970
one is the least charismatic of all the ones
that have come along.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.670
Suddenly he comes on television.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:19.079
He says: “We’re going to hunt down the
terrorists, and we’re going to wipe them

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:20.180
out in the outhouse.

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:26.239
If we find them in the outhouse, we’re going
to wipe them out in the outhouse.”

00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:29.279
It’s an amazing moment in all sorts of ways.

00:41:29.279 --> 00:41:36.430
One is that he claims this power that legally
he doesn’t actually have.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:41.049
The military didn’t report to the prime
minister, and the military still reports—all

00:41:41.049 --> 00:41:47.160
the uniform services report to the president
in Russia, not to the prime minister.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.969
It would have been Yeltsin’s job to sort
of say: “I'm going to save you.

00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:53.059
I'm going to have my Army or my police.”

00:41:53.059 --> 00:41:55.359
And Yeltsin is nowhere to be seen.

00:41:55.359 --> 00:42:00.710
Putin is given the front spot.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:04.029
And he’s also doing something that Yeltsin
wouldn’t have done.

00:42:04.029 --> 00:42:10.069
He’s not saying, “We’re going to find
those responsible and bring them to justice.”

00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:16.349
He has already called them terrorists, and
he is going to say: “We’re basically going

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:19.240
to extrajudicially execute them.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.799
We’re going to wipe them out in the outhouse.

00:42:22.799 --> 00:42:23.999
Forget the process.

00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:26.789
Forget this idea of bringing them to justice.

00:42:26.789 --> 00:42:28.739
It’s war.”

00:42:28.739 --> 00:42:37.819
It’s hugely resonant with this really scared
and battered population, so Putin’s popularity

00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:43.430
skyrockets at the same time that he gets name
recognitions, like it’s the same curve.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:48.469
And all of a sudden, he’s the most popular
politician in Russia because he is seen as

00:42:48.469 --> 00:42:51.289
spearheading the war on terrorism.

00:42:51.289 --> 00:42:52.940
MICHAEL KIRK - Fabulous.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:43:03.740
So on that midnight or that night to Christmas/New
Year’s Eve, when Yeltsin appoints him, Yeltsin

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:04.740
apologizes.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.009
And Putin comes on at midnight.

00:43:08.009 --> 00:43:12.969
Ordinarily, the prime minister or the president
speaks at midnight, but he comes on at midnight

00:43:12.969 --> 00:43:14.380
as the new president.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.819
What does he promise?

00:43:15.819 --> 00:43:17.900
What does he say?

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:18.900
…

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:25.089
MASHA GESSEN - Well, he very much saw himself,
I think at that point, as still a bureaucrat,

00:43:25.089 --> 00:43:30.529
and that became evident later in the year
2000.

00:43:30.529 --> 00:43:36.859
But there was Yeltsin, who I think had fully
accepted responsibility for the country, and

00:43:36.859 --> 00:43:40.700
fully felt like he had failed.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:49.260
So he gave this absolutely heartbreaking speech
in the middle of the afternoon that was just—he

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.079
apologized.

00:43:51.079 --> 00:44:01.980
He said that he wished that he had done a
better job by the Russian people, and he said,

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.109
“I'm tired, and I'm leaving.”

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:07.299
It was impossible not to cry watching.

00:44:07.299 --> 00:44:13.430
It was impossible not to cry watching it years
later when I was watching it again for research.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.079
Then at midnight, when normally the president
would speak, the new president, the acting

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:25.369
president came and said that he was going
to do his job.

00:44:25.369 --> 00:44:31.270
You would think that that might be disappointing
to a lot of people, that after that sort of—I

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:41.650
mean, with Yeltsin, even when he was ill and
despondent, it’s impossible to overstate

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:49.309
how charismatic he was, and how, as we would
say in Russian, the scale of his personality

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:50.599
was just outsize.

00:44:50.599 --> 00:44:58.170
So after he exits the stage, and this little
thing comes along and says nothing, but that

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.579
wasn’t disappointing for people.

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:07.799
It was actually an invitation, as it turned
out, to project their expectations, so there

00:45:07.799 --> 00:45:13.160
was a sort of surge of optimism that now things
were going to get fixed by this nobody.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:21.710
MICHAEL KIRK - As you watched him in that
first year or two, did you see manifestations

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.059
of what was to come?

00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:30.460
Was it obvious fairly early, the authoritarian
the Russian people have loved from Peter the

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:36.200
Great to Catherine the Great to Josef Stalin,
a certain kind of person, and I'm going to

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.349
be that person?

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:43.619
MASHA GESSEN - It was—I think partly because
I had reported from St. Petersburg for a couple

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:49.109
of years just before he became prime minister,
and I knew what a different place it was politically

00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:55.200
than the rest of Russia, I think I recognized
things in him that took other people a long

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.249
time to recognize.

00:45:56.249 --> 00:46:02.320
Another thing was that I came from a dissident
family, and I had been an émigré, and I

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.320
had come back.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.789
So I had this sort of, I don’t know, somewhat
different optics, especially because I had

00:46:08.789 --> 00:46:16.049
been brought up to be suspicious and afraid
of anybody who had any connection to the KGB.

00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:25.440
One of the things that struck me as very important
was what he did the day he became acting president.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.489
He signed a bunch of decrees.

00:46:28.489 --> 00:46:35.079
His first decree was giving Yeltsin immunity
from prosecution, which was part of the deal,

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:38.130
and probably anybody in that position would
have done it.

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:46.940
But among his first 10 decrees was a decree
reinstating primary military education in

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:55.349
high schools, and this was something that
was, to me, highly symbolic.

00:46:55.349 --> 00:47:00.430
When I went to school in the Soviet Union,
everybody—all the high school students had

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:06.269
to learn elementary military trades.

00:47:06.269 --> 00:47:12.099
I mean, first of all, we had military games,
survival games, from the time—I mean, games.

00:47:12.099 --> 00:47:13.250
We called them games.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.359
They weren’t games.

00:47:14.359 --> 00:47:16.210
They were training sessions, right?

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:21.599
But from the time you're very little, there
are bomb raids, and you learn to recognize

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:27.420
chemical burns, and you are drilled on how
to respond to chemical burns.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:33.950
The thing is, you know, these classrooms that
are—where the walls are covered with posters

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:41.039
on how to recognize different kinds of chemical
weapons, the effects of different kinds of

00:47:41.039 --> 00:47:45.900
chemical weapons and how to respond to them.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:54.519
And then in ninth and 10th grade, so in high
school, which is just two years, you learn

00:47:54.519 --> 00:48:03.599
to administer first aid in a military situation
and to take apart and clean a Kalashnikov

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:07.089
and put it back together again.

00:48:07.089 --> 00:48:13.150
Anybody my age or older will be able to tell
you how long it used to take them to take

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.170
apart and clean and put back together a Kalashnikov.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:24.009
A good amount of time is around nine or eight
seconds.

00:48:24.009 --> 00:48:29.029
That was eliminated when the Soviet Union
fell apart.

00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:36.569
And we forget now how much the 1990s, even
though Russia never really sort of fully entered

00:48:36.569 --> 00:48:43.140
a post-imperial era, but still, it became
a demilitarized country.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:49.690
All of a sudden, there was much less emphasis
on how every boy was a future soldier, which

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:51.229
is the way I was brought up.

00:48:51.229 --> 00:48:57.979
You would just see very many fewer people
in uniform in the streets.

00:48:57.979 --> 00:49:04.140
When I was growing up, when I used to go meet
my mother at the subway station when she was

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:11.959
coming home, I would—to entertain myself,
I would count the number of people in uniform

00:49:11.959 --> 00:49:14.829
coming off the trains as I waited for her.

00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:17.089
Roughly every 10th person would be wearing
a military uniform.

00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:20.369
All of a sudden, that was no longer the case.

00:49:20.369 --> 00:49:24.319
And of course children stopped learning how
to take apart and put back together a Kalashnikov

00:49:24.319 --> 00:49:26.339
in school.

00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:32.769
One of the first things that Putin did, on
the day that he became acting president, was

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:36.660
set in motion the process of bringing that
back.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.039
And I was convinced that—go ahead.

00:49:38.039 --> 00:49:39.039
MICHAEL KIRK - Sorry.

00:49:39.039 --> 00:49:45.300
MASHA GESSEN - No, I was convinced that he
was signaling his intention to remilitarize

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.170
Russian society, which is exactly what he
did.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:53.069
MICHAEL KIRK - What does it do to a society
to grow up with that eight-second Kalashnikov

00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:57.849
rebuild and then have it reintroduced?

00:49:57.849 --> 00:50:01.430
What's the signal that that sends to people?

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:09.509
MASHA GESSEN - Well, different people receive
the same signal differently.

00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:10.509
It frightened me.

00:50:10.509 --> 00:50:14.309
I didn’t want to live in a militarized society
again, and I thought the militarized Russia

00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:20.700
would be a dangerous country for the rest
of the world.

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:26.339
Countries don’t militarize in order to be
peaceful.

00:50:26.339 --> 00:50:32.160
For a lot of people, though, it was a signal
that they were going back to something that

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:39.549
was familiar and comfortable, both on a private
level, which is that you would do the same—their

00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:43.599
children would be doing the same things that
they did as children, right, but much more

00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:47.799
importantly on a public level, so that they
would have a chance to identify with a great

00:50:47.799 --> 00:50:48.799
country again.

00:50:48.799 --> 00:50:51.890
He would make Russia great again.

00:50:51.890 --> 00:51:00.029
For so many people in the 1990s, the instability
and discomfort that they experienced became

00:51:00.029 --> 00:51:07.650
concentrated in this idea of no longer belonging
to a great power.

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:17.099
So a lot of Putin’s early signals were that
he would bring back that wonderful feeling

00:51:17.099 --> 00:51:19.079
of being part of a great power again.

00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:22.509
MICHAEL KIRK - In a way, it’s right.

00:51:22.509 --> 00:51:27.880
He’s merging probably how he felt, having
missed glasnost and perestroika, not participating

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:35.200
in whatever was great about it, but he comes
home, he’s shipwrecked, whatever happens

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:41.730
to him, it’s a different world than he probably
anticipated finishing his life in.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:51.719
That sort of ethos that he shared with the
people was what he decided to employ as his

00:51:51.719 --> 00:51:56.729
method.

00:51:56.729 --> 00:52:02.890
In the end of his first year, George W. Bush
becomes president of the United States.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:09.279
One of the things we’ve noticed in tracing
the arc of this gigantic narrative is how

00:52:09.279 --> 00:52:16.710
often an American president arrives to a Russian
president with hope that all is going to get

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:23.199
better, from Gorbachev on; democracy will
flower now, and thank God.

00:52:23.199 --> 00:52:24.199
…

00:52:24.199 --> 00:52:27.670
MASHA GESSEN - Well, I want to say one more
thing about what happened with George W. Bush

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:34.661
becoming president in ’99, or in 2000, is
that Putin had just become president in a

00:52:34.661 --> 00:52:38.930
very orderly manner.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:42.059
He was handpicked by the previous president.

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:43.930
An election was scheduled.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:46.869
He won it handily.

00:52:46.869 --> 00:52:50.329
Everything went according to plan in his popularity.

00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:53.700
His margin of victory was pretty good.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.020
It was, I think, 53 percent in his first election.

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.829
And his popularity was sky-high.

00:52:58.829 --> 00:53:08.119
Then America goes and has this ridiculous
election that isn't settled for two months

00:53:08.119 --> 00:53:15.630
or two and a half months, and that just goes
to show you how a democracy is such an imperfect

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.239
system, and probably an outdated and failed
system.

00:53:19.239 --> 00:53:24.289
I'm convinced that that’s the first time
that Putin really watched an American presidential

00:53:24.289 --> 00:53:25.390
election closely.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:30.119
He’d never thought of himself as somebody
who existed on that level.

00:53:30.119 --> 00:53:39.089
Now he’s waiting to see who his counterpart
is going to be, and he can't even know who

00:53:39.089 --> 00:53:42.359
his counterpart is going to be for two and
a half months, because democracy is such a

00:53:42.359 --> 00:53:43.359
mess.

00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:44.359
…

00:53:44.359 --> 00:53:46.890
MICHAEL KIRK - When they meet, the way the
stories go, and especially—I've just talked

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:52.220
to a lot of American diplomats and ambassadors
who were there at that first meeting.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:57.369
This is the “I looked in his eyes and saw
his soul” meeting.

00:53:57.369 --> 00:54:03.160
Some people tell the story that here is a
KGB guy who’s the president of Russia, who’s

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.839
studied Bush, knows he’s an evangelical,
knows that he has a penchant and a weakness

00:54:07.839 --> 00:54:14.430
for a religious story, dredges up a religious
story out of his own past, the crucifix-in-the-ashes

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:19.950
story, and somehow they connect.

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:23.890
Tell me what you know about that version of
the story.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:28.170
MASHA GESSEN - Actually, I have nothing to
add to that version of the story.

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:34.789
What I would say is that early on he was a
charmer, early on in his term as president.

00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:37.599
That’s no longer the case.

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:46.359
But everyone I've talked to [who] had a meeting
with him in the first year or two of his becoming

00:54:46.359 --> 00:54:51.470
acting president and then president came away
transformed, at least for the first few minutes.

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:56.370
Well, actually, with one exception: one of
the journalists who worked on that official

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:58.220
biography.

00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:06.210
But everyone else felt that he sort of, he
turned on the recruiter charm, and he was

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:12.289
well-briefed, and he always used a little
personal anecdote to connect with you on the

00:55:12.289 --> 00:55:18.050
grounds that he figured would be good for
connecting.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:21.519
A few years down the road, he stopped paying
attention.

00:55:21.519 --> 00:55:26.670
He would start mixing people’s names up
or the facts of people’s biographies.

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:32.509
By the time I met him in 2012, he wasn’t
even briefed.

00:55:32.509 --> 00:55:37.559
He knew almost nothing about me, like he hadn’t
bothered.

00:55:37.559 --> 00:55:40.299
But early on, he was a real recruiter.

00:55:40.299 --> 00:55:46.249
And I think he certainly worked his charm
on George W. Bush, which apparently wasn’t

00:55:46.249 --> 00:55:47.680
very difficult.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:54.099
MICHAEL KIRK - There's a lot of hope, of course,
that they’ll do all kinds of things.

00:55:54.099 --> 00:56:00.380
A lot of people have said—we’ll ask them:
“What did Putin want from Bush?

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:02.329
What did Russia want from Bush?

00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:06.589
But more importantly, what did Putin want
from Bush and America?”

00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:07.819
What do you think that was?

00:56:07.819 --> 00:56:15.119
MASHA GESSEN - Well, Putin wanted the return
of a bipolar world.

00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:17.220
That was his agenda from the very beginning.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.130
He wanted to be treated with respect.

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:24.789
He wanted people back home to see that he
was being treated with respect.

00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:35.150
This was also coming very soon after the NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia, right, which, for the

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:40.329
Russian political establishment and for a
lot of Russian people, was a really difficult

00:56:40.329 --> 00:56:42.009
pill to swallow.

00:56:42.009 --> 00:56:43.009
...

00:56:43.009 --> 00:56:50.089
The U.S. and its allies decided to bomb Serbia
and Kosovo to resolve the Kosovo crisis without

00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:51.539
consulting with Russia.

00:56:51.539 --> 00:57:00.010
And to make matters worse, they started bombing,
or the U.S. started bombing when Yevgeny Primakov,

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.839
the then-prime minister, was in the air, on
his way to the United States to meet with

00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:07.349
Vice President Gore.

00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:13.279
So they didn’t even make a show of informing
Russia before starting bombing, never mind

00:57:13.279 --> 00:57:20.170
consulting Russia, and that was really insulting
for the entire Russian establishment and a

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:23.709
lot of Russian people.

00:57:23.709 --> 00:57:28.579
One of the things that Putin wanted to project
was that that kind of thing was never going

00:57:28.579 --> 00:57:30.190
to happen again.

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:36.740
MICHAEL KIRK - Then America pulls out of the
ABM [Anti-Ballistic Missile] Treaty, not really

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:37.740
consulting.

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.079
In fact, he begged Bush not to do it.

00:57:41.079 --> 00:57:48.829
They invade, or we invade Iraq, taking down
an authoritarian figure who stands astride

00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:54.059
a big—somewhat in the sphere of influence
of Russia.

00:57:54.059 --> 00:57:57.940
Russia joins with France and Germany and says:
“Please don’t do this.

00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:58.940
Are you guys going to do this?

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.319
Are you really going to do this?”

00:58:00.319 --> 00:58:06.319
And they do it with a certain level of impunity,
at least.

00:58:06.319 --> 00:58:11.489
It seems that the word you used early to describe
what he was hoping for, which is respect,

00:58:11.489 --> 00:58:16.869
was hardly in the air between George W. Bush
and the United States of America, and Vladimir

00:58:16.869 --> 00:58:17.869
Putin and Russia.

00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:22.039
MASHA GESSEN - And what's even worse, I think
from Putin’s point of view, is the expansion

00:58:22.039 --> 00:58:24.019
of NATO.

00:58:24.019 --> 00:58:35.309
It doesn’t ever sort of—in his worldview,
it is not a question of these countries asking

00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:36.329
to be part of NATO.

00:58:36.329 --> 00:58:43.720
It is merely a question of the United States
deciding that NATO should expand to the Russian

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.720
border.

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:52.540
He’s also convinced that the Soviet Union
got assurances from the United States that

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.180
NATO would not be expanded.

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.180
...

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.930
The quote that Putin likes to bring up was
a quote by the then-NATO commander given during

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:05.589
the negotiations about the reunification of
Germany.

00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:11.499
The promise was that there would be no NATO
troops stationed on what had been East German

00:59:11.499 --> 00:59:12.499
territory.

00:59:12.499 --> 00:59:13.499
That’s the quote.

00:59:13.499 --> 00:59:16.160
And that was a matter of negotiations.

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:21.299
This was, first of all, this was a negotiation
with the Soviet Union, and then—and the

00:59:21.299 --> 00:59:26.140
Soviet Union was pushing for a solution where
somehow Germany would be united.

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:30.599
But East Germany still wouldn’t be a part
of NATO.

00:59:30.599 --> 00:59:36.009
And the compromise solution was that there
would be no troops on what had been East German

00:59:36.009 --> 00:59:37.009
territory.

00:59:37.009 --> 00:59:41.680
That has nothing to do with NATO expansion
as such, and it also certainly has nothing

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.680
to do with Russia.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.239
I mean, this was being negotiated with the
Soviet Union.

00:59:45.239 --> 00:59:50.770
This was before the demise of the Warsaw Pact.

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:59.499
But in 2007, at the security conference in
Munich, Putin shocks world leaders by giving

00:59:59.499 --> 01:00:04.079
a very, very strongly worded speech about
how Russia was not going to take it anymore.

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:07.599
MICHAEL KIRK - Can you take me there?

01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:12.749
What has angered him, or what has happened
in his world that he can go to Munich and

01:00:12.749 --> 01:00:14.859
so forcefully declare?

01:00:14.859 --> 01:00:23.690
It’s not declaring war, but it’s certainly
declaring verbal war on, in an unspoken way,

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.680
the United States of America.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.849
MASHA GESSEN - This is the end of his second
term, and he has really been transformed.

01:00:32.849 --> 01:00:36.359
He has already taken over the media in Russia.

01:00:36.359 --> 01:00:39.660
He’s already canceled gubernatorial elections.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:44.380
He’s canceled elections to the upper house
of the Russian parliament.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.650
He’s solidified power.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:50.859
He is ruling very much like a dictator.

01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:55.900
The process of dismantling what democratic
mechanisms had existed in Russia was completed

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.229
in his first term, and this is the end of
his second term.

01:00:59.229 --> 01:01:04.989
Also, Russia has been living for seven years
through a period of unprecedented prosperity,

01:01:04.989 --> 01:01:07.460
because oil prices just keep climbing.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.190
Money is just flowing into Russia.

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:12.280
Putin has enriched himself.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.289
Everyone around him has enriched himself.

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:20.910
At the same time, he has emasculated the men
who used to be known as the oligarchs.

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:25.680
They’ve ceded their political power to him,
and a lot of their financial power, in exchange

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.680
for safety and security of those assets that
they're allowed to keep.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.959
He’s really the patriarch of this country.

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:42.160
In Russia itself, people perceive him as enjoying
the respect of the West, but he doesn’t

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:51.039
feel any respect, because the United States
has invaded Afghanistan and then Iraq without

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:53.470
consulting with Russia, and in fact ignoring
Russia’s wishes.

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:56.709
The United States has pulled out of the ABM
Treaty.

01:01:56.709 --> 01:01:59.680
And worst of all, NATO has expanded.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:07.999
He’s been saving all of this resentment
up because there he is—he feels like he

01:02:07.999 --> 01:02:09.519
has transformed his country.

01:02:09.519 --> 01:02:14.150
He’s made it great again, and he still doesn’t
get any recognition of that when he meets

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:15.150
with world leaders.

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:20.009
He is still treated very much like a junior
partner by everybody.

01:02:20.009 --> 01:02:25.019
And so he comes to the security conference
in Munich and says, basically: “I don’t

01:02:25.019 --> 01:02:28.589
have to mince words, do I?

01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:31.029
I can say what's on my mind.”

01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:37.029
And then he just lashes out, and he lists
all these resentments, especially the NATO

01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:44.619
expansion, referring to a nonexistent agreement,
a nonexistent promise that NATO would never

01:02:44.619 --> 01:02:45.619
expand.

01:02:45.619 --> 01:02:51.289
It’s a total change of tone that comes as
a complete surprise to his Western counterparts.

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:58.269
MICHAEL KIRK - Then one of the other things
we do is we’re tracking the development

01:02:58.269 --> 01:03:06.449
of military power, including hybrid power
and including cyber and information war and

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:13.390
hard power.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:14.849
Things begin to happen.

01:03:14.849 --> 01:03:17.410
Estonia is two months later.

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:25.849
Then Georgia 1, or Georgia 2, Ukraine—all
of it begins to happen, and all of it feels

01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:34.559
like a rehearsal for something, or a perfecting
of the military might.

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:40.549
Help me understand what he’s doing in terms
of military power and where that fits into

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:45.939
this sense I'm getting from you, that he’s
looking for not only making Russia great again,

01:03:45.939 --> 01:03:48.589
but making people believe Russia is great
again.

01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:55.219
MASHA GESSEN - So he starts increasing military
spending.

01:03:55.219 --> 01:03:56.890
First it’s not extraordinary.

01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:01.680
Now it’s quite extraordinary, the amount
of money that Russia has been spending on

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.089
the military.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:07.470
But he’s certainly interested in military
reform.

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:11.259
A lot of people believe that he has militarized
the Russian power establishment.

01:04:11.259 --> 01:04:18.130
There are some counterarguments against that,
but I mean, he loves his generals, and he

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:23.019
loves talking about how he’s bringing the
military back.

01:04:23.019 --> 01:04:34.579
He’s also investing money in ways of waging
hybrid warfare, and an excuse to test some

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.740
of that presents itself.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.210
Really, it’s just—it’s even hard to
call it—it’s a pretext.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:55.670
In the spring of 2007, Estonia moves a monument
to 

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:58.849
a Russian soldier, right?

01:04:58.849 --> 01:05:13.559
When the Soviet Union occupied Eastern and
Central Europe in 1945, it erected monuments

01:05:13.559 --> 01:05:21.979
to the liberation of those countries, in the
centers of every capital of those occupied

01:05:21.979 --> 01:05:23.189
countries.

01:05:23.189 --> 01:05:28.359
Now, some countries have chosen to look the
other way, like Austria, which still has a

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:38.539
giant monument to its liberation by the Soviet
soldiers in central Vienna.

01:05:38.539 --> 01:05:40.279
But for some countries, it was much more problematic.

01:05:40.279 --> 01:05:49.099
And for Estonia, which had been not only under
Soviet occupation for half a century, but

01:05:49.099 --> 01:05:59.699
really based its post-Soviet identity on the
idea of occupation, right, to have that monument

01:05:59.699 --> 01:06:03.469
in the center of town was really problematic.

01:06:03.469 --> 01:06:13.029
It also became a focal point for both Estonian
nationalists who would deface the monument

01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:19.299
and [for] pro-Russian gatherings.

01:06:19.299 --> 01:06:25.029
Estonia has a huge ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking
population of non-citizens.

01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:32.380
So this was—it was a problem in town.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:36.549
They decided to solve this problem by moving
the monument to a military cemetery.

01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:45.019
The monument included 12 graves, so they moved
the monument to a military cemetery, and Russia

01:06:45.019 --> 01:06:49.219
really could have reacted in any number of
ways, but Russia reacted with outrage.

01:06:49.219 --> 01:06:52.779
Now, another thing that Putin had been doing
is he had been creating these youth movements

01:06:52.779 --> 01:07:07.439
sort of semi-vigilante, military in style
if not—though not armed, basically para-armies

01:07:07.439 --> 01:07:11.660
of young people to support the Kremlin.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:16.249
So they are unleashed on the Estonian Embassy
in Moscow.

01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:25.609
The Estonian Embassy is essentially occupied
for three days, and these so-called activists

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:30.150
demand that the Estonian ambassador go home.

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:35.109
The ambassador finally went home officially
on vacation, but they said, “OK, our job

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:36.930
is done,” and left.

01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:45.439
But at the same time—and Estonia is the
most technologically advanced country in the

01:07:45.439 --> 01:07:47.410
world.

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.099
Its entire government is electronic.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:53.819
It’s the first country to offer e-citizenship.

01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:54.819
Everything is on a chip.

01:07:54.819 --> 01:07:59.180
You get stopped for a traffic violation or
you go see a doctor, you use the same ID card

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.969
with a chip in it.

01:08:00.969 --> 01:08:08.109
And all of a sudden, the entire Estonian system
of government goes down because of pretty

01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:18.449
primitive but enormous DDoS attack, [Distributed]
Denial of Service attack launched on Estonia.

01:08:18.449 --> 01:08:20.299
At the time, Russia denies that it’s involved.

01:08:20.299 --> 01:08:25.960
Two years later, the leader of one of those
youth movements says, “Yeah, it was an army

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.020
of volunteer hackers who unleashed that war.”

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:38.009
But it really shows Estonia who’s boss,
because Estonia may be the most technologically

01:08:38.009 --> 01:08:40.989
advanced country in the world, and it may
have built a great democracy, but it’s just

01:08:40.989 --> 01:08:49.170
1.2 million people, and you unleash 1.2 million
hackers on them, and they can't stand up to

01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:50.170
it.

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:58.190
MICHAEL KIRK - How much of this and the Orange
and Rose Revolution responses by Russia are

01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:00.779
manifestations of Putin’s temper?

01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:08.359
MASHA GESSEN - I think it’s both his temper
and his perception of the world as essentially

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:09.690
hostile.

01:09:09.690 --> 01:09:18.319
He personally perceives the world as essentially
hostile, not just hostile to Russia, but hostile

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:27.719
to him, hostile to people he loves, just a
really dangerous place.

01:09:27.719 --> 01:09:35.489
So every time something happens, it’s probably
a sign of danger, and the revolutions in both

01:09:35.489 --> 01:09:39.190
Georgia and Ukraine were signs of danger.

01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:44.819
In fact, in 2004 Ukraine had an election.

01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:46.730
The election was very clearly rigged.

01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:51.960
People started protesting in the streets,
and eventually the Supreme Court, the Ukrainian

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.929
Supreme Court, ruled that—invalidated the
results of the election and called for a third

01:09:57.929 --> 01:10:00.800
runoff election to set things right.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.469
Now, there were a couple of things that, for
Putin, I think, were indications of danger.

01:10:05.469 --> 01:10:11.550
One is— there's an obvious one—which is
that an independent judiciary is really dangerous

01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:14.980
for a leader who relies on the rigged elections.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:21.429
But again, people in the streets is a really
frightening sight to Putin.

01:10:21.429 --> 01:10:25.270
People in the streets can make all sorts of
things happen, so instead of sort of watching

01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:30.699
it and thinking, oh, we don’t have an independent
judiciary, so people can come out in the streets

01:10:30.699 --> 01:10:37.099
and then go right back home, because they
can't set in motion any mechanisms, because

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:41.139
he’d long since reversed judicial reform
in Russia, which didn’t get very far in

01:10:41.139 --> 01:10:46.610
the first place, instead he sees people in
the streets wreaking havoc.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:51.880
But he’s also convinced that people don’t
just come out into the streets.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.199
They have to be driven by somebody.

01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:55.300
There has to be a puppet master.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:11:00.750
Somebody’s funding them, and it’s probably
the United States.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:07.190
That’s actually when he started creating
these youth armies.

01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:11.690
There's a wonderful Australian scholar named
Robert Horvath who calls it “Putin’s preventive

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:14.610
counterrevolution.”

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.310
He launched a counterrevolution in his own
country without waiting for a revolution to

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:24.960
happen, but he was terrified of a revolution
like the one in Ukraine or the one in Georgia.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.590
The one in Ukraine is known as the Orange
Revolution, and the one in Georgia is known

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.750
as the Rose Revolution.

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:33.250
Nothing like that would ever happen in Russia,
because there was already an army of young

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:37.719
people in place to basically to fight the
protesters in the streets if they should come

01:11:37.719 --> 01:11:39.409
out into the streets.

01:11:39.409 --> 01:11:47.719
MICHAEL KIRK - By the time Obama comes in—we’re
talking about the reset—[Dmitry] Medvedev

01:11:47.719 --> 01:11:49.380
is in.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:57.929
Is it an obvious fiction—was it an obvious
fiction to you what it was going to be, or

01:11:57.929 --> 01:11:58.980
is it an irrelevant fiction?

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.590
He [Putin] is still the most powerful guy
in the country no matter what?

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:07.599
I know to Obama and Hillary, it seems like
they—and we’ve talked to lots of people

01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:13.480
who are around them—they really had high
hopes that it was a true reset moment.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:22.710
MASHA GESSEN - … I think at this point I
can probably say it.

01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:30.510
I was able to observe a little bit of that
policymaking, and part of it was this idea,

01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:38.900
this cynical and I think overconfident idea
that if the United States empowered Medvedev,

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:43.219
then he would become the actual president.

01:12:43.219 --> 01:12:48.679
I think that there were certainly intelligent
people in the State Department at the time

01:12:48.679 --> 01:12:53.489
who knew perfectly well that it was a fiction,
and the basic understanding in the State Department

01:12:53.489 --> 01:12:58.730
was that yes, it’s a fiction, but maybe
we can make it real.

01:12:58.730 --> 01:13:01.360
MICHAEL KIRK - So what did you witness?

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.510
What did you see?

01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:07.260
What can you talk about?

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:15.460
MASHA GESSEN - I witnessed some of those,
sort of the policymaking, and the idea—I

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:21.250
mean, everybody on the team, on the Russia
team, I think in the State Department, did

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:26.639
realize that Medvedev was a fiction; he was
a placeholder.

01:13:26.639 --> 01:13:32.120
But there was a hope that sometimes these
things take on a life of their own.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.360
They really do.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.920
I don’t think it’s—it’s not a crazy
idea.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.940
In fact, Putin was very much that kind of
phenomenon as well, right?

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:47.030
He was sort of a fake accidental president,
and then he was a real one.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:56.699
I think that what they underestimated hugely
was just how entrenched the clan system that

01:13:56.699 --> 01:14:08.530
Putin had put in place was by 2008 when he
put Medvedev in that chair as a placeholder.

01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:15.050
I think that’s best described as a mafia
state, which is a term invented by a Hungarian

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:21.000
scholar named Bálint Magyar, who actually
makes a very strong argument that it’s important

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.119
to understand that it’s not crony capitalism
or a kleptocracy; it’s a mafia state.

01:14:27.119 --> 01:14:32.100
It’s administered by a patriarch, and power
is distributed by the patriarch, just as money

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.659
is distributed by the patriarch.

01:14:34.659 --> 01:14:35.659
Putin was still the patriarch.

01:14:35.659 --> 01:14:38.440
It doesn’t matter what title he had.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.579
I think they also didn’t realize, and I
didn’t realize this until probably a couple

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:51.070
of years into the so-called Medvedev administration,
that Medvedev just had absolutely no resources.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:56.110
He had a couple of people working for him,
a press secretary and an assistant, and like

01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:58.960
one other guy.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.889
Everything was concentrated around Putin.

01:15:01.889 --> 01:15:07.780
At the same time, Medvedev had—legally,
he had the right to fire Putin.

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.710
The president can fire the prime minister.

01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:13.210
MICHAEL KIRK - But he’s not going to do
that.

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:16.739
MASHA GESSEN - Well, one could hope that he
would do that.

01:15:16.739 --> 01:15:21.780
Then it’s very hard to sort of to discuss
a counterfactual.

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:29.630
Like if the United States had not gone for
the reset, would it have worked any better?

01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:31.110
I don’t know.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:43.989
I think that the fact that the reset came
after the war in Georgia, and the war in Georgia

01:15:43.989 --> 01:15:52.840
was technically fought under the Medvedev
administration, and to sort of come to Russia

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:59.429
and say, “We’re willing to write it off,
you know, write off the annexation of a third—of

01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:07.280
a neighboring country,” it’s deeply immoral.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.469
It also so happens that it was completely
ineffective.

01:16:11.469 --> 01:16:20.699
So the U.S. sacrificed some of its key foreign
policy principles for nothing.

01:16:20.699 --> 01:16:29.930
MICHAEL KIRK - It seems like it all falls
apart, really falls apart starting with the

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:37.190
Arab Spring, from [Egypt’s Hosni] Mubarak
to [Libya’s Muammar al-]Qaddafi and the

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:42.010
vote Medvedev makes.

01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:49.800
But when do you think it—what was the tipping
point in that sort of false presidential moment?

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.099
What happens?

01:16:51.099 --> 01:16:53.501
MASHA GESSEN - The false presidential moment?

01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:57.920
MICHAEL KIRK - Well, it makes Putin reassert
himself actually and say, “I'm going back

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.920
in.”

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.962
MASHA GESSEN - Oh, I think he was always planning
to go back.

01:17:00.962 --> 01:17:02.179
MICHAEL KIRK - No matter what?

01:17:02.179 --> 01:17:09.320
MASHA GESSEN - Yeah, I don’t think that
he ever considered the possibility of not

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.440
running for election again.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:17.800
If he did, it was more of a possibility of
changing the constitution to make it basically

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.989
a parliamentary republic.

01:17:18.989 --> 01:17:20.380
MICHAEL KIRK - And then he’d have it anyway.

01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.760
MASHA GESSEN - And then he’d have all the
power legally.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:30.949
There was no way he was going to stay in a
legally less powerful position for more than

01:17:30.949 --> 01:17:32.180
four years.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:36.820
The fact that the first thing that Medvedev
did when he came into office was change the

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:42.829
constitution to extend the presidency to six
years indicates that, from the very beginning,

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:46.100
the plan was for Putin to then come back in
for six years.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:52.449
Then it was, you know, it was done right away,
and it wasn’t being done for Medvedev’s

01:17:52.449 --> 01:17:53.449
benefit.

01:17:53.449 --> 01:18:01.890
MICHAEL KIRK - When the people hit the streets
in the midst of the announcement that he’s

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:08.829
coming back, and Hillary says, the statement
she says around the election, the unfairness

01:18:08.829 --> 01:18:16.170
of the election, and Putin reacts so negatively,
negatively enough that, whether it’s a pretext

01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:20.580
or not, he seems to remember it, a lot of
people are saying it’s a motivation for

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.219
the attack in 2016.

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:26.650
How do you read what was happening with the
people on the street?

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:31.969
Here we are again, people on the street, Putin;
it’s becoming a familiar pattern.

01:18:31.969 --> 01:18:37.469
But how do you read that, Hillary’s statement
and the effect it had on Putin?

01:18:37.469 --> 01:18:39.059
What did that look like from Putin’s perspective?

01:18:39.059 --> 01:18:49.060
MASHA GESSEN - Well, so from Putin’s perspective,
I mean by 2011-2012, he has completely lost

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:55.449
the ability to distinguish himself from his
regime, his regime from the country—from

01:18:55.449 --> 01:18:57.630
the state, and the state from the country.

01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:05.550
When he sees people coming out into the streets
to protest him and his regime, he sees them

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:07.980
protesting Russia itself.

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:11.059
I think that’s a sincere view of the world.

01:19:11.059 --> 01:19:13.610
He knows what's best for Russia.

01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.510
They want to destroy Russia.

01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:19.679
If they want to destroy Russia, then obviously
they're not Russians.

01:19:19.679 --> 01:19:24.780
So they must be—their puppet master—and
he’s always been convinced that there are

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:30.280
puppet masters behind any protest—but their
puppet master has to be whoever is opposed

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.280
to Russia.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:42.050
Well, obviously, what’s the only thing that’s
powerful enough to oppose Russia and to incite

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:43.050
these protests?

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:46.389
It has to be the U.S. State Department, because
it would be insulting to think that it was

01:19:46.389 --> 01:19:50.139
anything else, anything less than that.

01:19:50.139 --> 01:19:56.570
And Hillary is the secretary of state, so
obviously it’s her fault, personally.

01:19:56.570 --> 01:20:06.869
MICHAEL KIRK - Let’s address Sochi, Crimea,
Ukraine, all in a kind of moment, if you can.

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:09.389
What does Sochi mean?

01:20:09.389 --> 01:20:12.949
It’s been going on since late November,
early December [2014], down in Ukraine.

01:20:12.949 --> 01:20:17.770
I don’t really need to know the details
since I know about [Ukrainian President Viktor]

01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:19.500
Yanukovych and all the rest.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.469
But it’s to Putin this glorious moment.

01:20:22.469 --> 01:20:24.219
This other thing is happening.

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:28.460
He hates it for all the reasons you’ve just
articulated, and he’s got a kind of plan,

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:34.550
I guess, to go after Crimea and then down
into Ukraine, using his new hybrid forces,

01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:35.550
I suppose.

01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:43.789
MASHA GESSEN - I think that by 2014, really
military buildup has become his number one

01:20:43.789 --> 01:20:46.969
priority, and there are a few reasons for
this.

01:20:46.969 --> 01:20:49.150
One is that he loves the military.

01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:51.880
He sees it as Russia’s ultimate greatness.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:57.980
But the other thing is that he has to become
a mobilizational leader.

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:08.110
The bargain that he had with the population,
which is basically exchanging sort of a sense

01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:14.639
of overwhelming prosperity that he was giving
them for unlimited power that they were giving

01:21:14.639 --> 01:21:20.550
him, that’s not working anymore, because
the Russian economy is becoming stagnant.

01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:27.530
Oil prices haven't started dropping yet, but
because of corruption and because of the overreliance

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:37.530
on extractive economy, the economic growth
has basically slowed to a crawl by 2013, by

01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:41.699
the end of 2013.

01:21:41.699 --> 01:21:45.590
He still has to throw this big party, which
he’s been planning for many years.

01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:51.690
He went to Guatemala City personally to lobby
for the Olympics.

01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:55.310
Not only that, he gave a speech in English,
which he’d never done before.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:58.400
I think it was—or was it French?

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:05.929
Anyway, it was a language that he doesn’t
usually use.

01:22:05.929 --> 01:22:10.220
So he has been planning for this great moment.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:19.210
And the Olympics—remember, the last Olympics
in Russia were the Moscow Olympics in 1980,

01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:24.910
which were supposed to also be a symbol of
greatness, and turned into something entirely

01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:31.760
different because the United States boycotted
the Moscow Olympics over the invasion of Afghanistan.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:40.170
So it’s also partly taking revenge for that
humiliation of 1980.

01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:41.770
All of that is on one pile.

01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:51.550
And then in the fall of 2013, it turns out
that a lot of Western countries aren’t sending

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:59.079
their luminaries, the first—I think it was
the president of Germany [Joachim Gauck] who

01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:03.739
said he wasn’t coming, then Belgium, then
someone else.

01:23:03.739 --> 01:23:14.050
Then finally Obama announces his delegation,
which doesn’t include an elected official.

01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:18.390
The highest placed official that it includes
is a deputy assistant secretary of state,

01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:20.599
which is just an insult.

01:23:20.599 --> 01:23:29.530
And, to add more insult, there are two openly
gay former Olympians in the delegation.

01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:34.730
This is about a year and a half into Putin’s
anti-gay campaign, because the way that he

01:23:34.730 --> 01:23:40.679
ended up dealing with the protesters was by
queer-baiting them and by sort of focusing

01:23:40.679 --> 01:23:44.850
Russia’s ire on the LGBT population.

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:48.130
There are no good photo ops in Sochi.

01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:52.369
It’s basically, instead of a party, it’s
a disaster.

01:23:52.369 --> 01:23:57.840
At the last minute, Putin tried to clean up
his act by releasing [Mikhail] Khodorkovsy,

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:02.550
the former oligarch, who had been a political
prisoner for 10 years; releasing the members

01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:08.579
of Pussy Riot, who had been in jail for nearly
two years; releasing the 30—I think [thirty]

01:24:08.579 --> 01:24:15.130
two members of Greenpeace who were in a ship
that Russia had hijacked in neutral waters,

01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:22.550
in international waters in September, a ship
flying the Dutch flag.

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:24.090
So they release all of those people.

01:24:24.090 --> 01:24:27.389
But it’s too late to save Sochi.

01:24:27.389 --> 01:24:32.650
That adds more resentment to his feelings
around Sochi.

01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:39.239
Meanwhile, Ukraine, which is not just Russia’s
closest neighbor but very much sort of the

01:24:39.239 --> 01:24:44.590
country that Russia identifies with, and really,
really identifies with, right—I mean, Russians

01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:50.860
of all kinds look at Ukraine to understand
their own country, and Putin is no exception.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:56.870
In Ukraine, there have been these protests
going on for now several months, and it’s

01:24:56.870 --> 01:25:06.510
because Ukrainians want a closer association
with Western Europe rather than [with] Russia.

01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:10.280
He interprets those protests as anti-Russian.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.280
But they’ve thrown the country into absolute
turmoil.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.610
Now, so all of that is in place.

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:19.020
And his military buildup is in place.

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:23.360
I don’t think it’s a matter of having
plans for the Crimea in place.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.409
It’s a matter of having plans for everything
in place.

01:25:27.409 --> 01:25:32.699
It’s like Chekhov’s gun hanging on the
wall, except that they have a plan for invading

01:25:32.699 --> 01:25:35.329
every country on the wall, right?

01:25:35.329 --> 01:25:39.719
That’s what a lot of the investment of the
military has been, is making plans for how

01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:41.390
are we going to fight this war and this other
war?

01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:48.590
How are we going to re-annex parts of Finland,
and how are we going to re-annex the Baltic

01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:51.360
states and Moldova and Ukraine?

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.710
So here is the moment to take Crimea.

01:25:55.710 --> 01:26:00.409
And it’s clear, from the way that the Crimean
operation was carried out, that it was indeed

01:26:00.409 --> 01:26:01.969
a well-planned operation.

01:26:01.969 --> 01:26:07.289
It was carried out on the spur of the moment
when he saw the opportunity, but the plans

01:26:07.289 --> 01:26:13.079
for the operation had long since been designed.

01:26:13.079 --> 01:26:16.590
It was just a matter of implementation.

01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:22.059
Then there are a lot of people around him
who want to go further, who want to go into

01:26:22.059 --> 01:26:27.270
Ukraine, and he has nothing to lose by going
into Ukraine—not that he actually thinks

01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:28.270
about his losses.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:32.619
He’s a brilliant opportunist and not a planner.

01:26:32.619 --> 01:26:36.110
Actually, Sochi is a perfect example of how
little he plans.

01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:43.090
Usually, the Olympics aren’t very often
held in dictatorships, and dictatorships usually

01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:49.010
clean up their act a year or two before the
Olympics, and then do things like arrest all

01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:54.110
the political dissidents and reinstate the
death penalty like China did the day after

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:55.639
the Olympics ends.

01:26:55.639 --> 01:26:56.639
But not Russia.

01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:59.860
Russia didn’t clean up its act because Putin
is not a planner, right?

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:04.219
Putin realized that he had to do something
six weeks before the actual Olympics and released

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:05.219
everybody, but it was too late.

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:10.659
It’s not like he’s looking ahead to what's
going to happen if he invades Ukraine.

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:17.760
He invades Ukraine because he can, and because
it’s good for mobilization, and it’s worked

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.989
really well for him.

01:27:19.989 --> 01:27:30.050
If you look at his popularity curve, it goes
up vertically again, just like it did in September-October

01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:33.230
1999, when he promised to hunt down the terrorists.

01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:45.579
It goes up vertically again, just as the economic
expectations curve goes down.

01:27:45.579 --> 01:27:48.860
You never actually see that in a normal country.

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:54.420
You never see a leader whose popularity is
up and holding while people’s subjective

01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:02.969
economic well-being is down, drops down precipitously
and holds.

01:28:02.969 --> 01:28:05.639
Sociologists will tell you that those lines
have to meet.

01:28:05.639 --> 01:28:08.199
In fact, they have to cross in opposite direction.

01:28:08.199 --> 01:28:12.039
But that doesn’t happen in Russia.

01:28:12.039 --> 01:28:17.159
And I think the reason it doesn’t happen
in Russia is because ultimately, Russia has

01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:24.400
reverted to this state of mobilization identification
with the state.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.079
He has delivered what he promised, which is
to bring back to people the feeling of identifying

01:28:30.079 --> 01:28:31.079
with something great.

01:28:31.079 --> 01:28:41.690
MICHAEL KIRK - And when they're hammered with
sanctions, does that diminish him in some

01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:42.690
way?

01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:43.690
Does it diminish him with his people?

01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:51.860
MASHA GESSEN - Well, did something really
interesting with the sanctions.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:57.710
The U.S. and the European Union and Australia
and I think a couple other countries introduced

01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:14.750
sanctions, which were designed to—they were
based on a ridiculous premise that comes from

01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:22.639
a basic misunderstanding of the way that Russia
works, that if they squeezed him economically

01:29:22.639 --> 01:29:33.079
a little bit, his popularity would suffer,
people would protest, and then he would have

01:29:33.079 --> 01:29:34.690
to change his behavior.

01:29:34.690 --> 01:29:44.340
First of all, Putin had been power, by that
point, for 15 years.

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:49.260
He had never shown an ability to change course.

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:55.079
He had never shown that he reacts to pressure
with anything but aggression.

01:29:55.079 --> 01:30:01.000
But also, there's a fundamental misunderstanding
of how his dialog with his people was working.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.880
By this time, he had cracked down in the wake
of the protests, so Russia was two years into

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.429
a full-fledged political crackdown.

01:30:09.429 --> 01:30:18.000
It’s not like he was worried about feedback,
and it’s not like protests were a real option.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.990
But they also clearly weren’t looking at
how much more popular he had become because

01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:26.070
of the invasion.

01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:29.260
So sanctions—I'm not opposed to sanctions.

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:35.380
I just think that sanctions should be based
on moral considerations and values, not on

01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:40.840
the idea that they could squeeze him into
changing his behavior.

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:45.880
But after sanctions went into effect, Putin
did something extraordinary, which is he made

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.969
the sanctions worse.

01:30:47.969 --> 01:30:57.789
He introduced countersanctions, banned the
import of food products from all the countries

01:30:57.789 --> 01:31:04.130
that had joined the sanctions, with the exception
of Switzerland.

01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:11.079
That actually was a huge blow to the Russian
economy, but especially to sort of individual

01:31:11.079 --> 01:31:19.969
economy, because at the time, nearly all Russian
food was imported, partly because it’s an

01:31:19.969 --> 01:31:20.980
extractive economy.

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:23.460
The ruble had been very strong for many years.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:27.000
There was no reason for Russians to make their
own food.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.570
They were importing it.

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:38.090
The saner rationale for those countersanctions
was to jumpstart Russian food production,

01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:42.230
but of course, that’s not how it works,
right?

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:44.510
Prices went through the roof.

01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:46.190
People really felt the squeeze.

01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:49.750
But that actually made the sense of being
at war stronger.

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:58.409
Even though people suffered, Putin’s popularity
didn’t suffer, and it still hasn’t suffered.

01:31:58.409 --> 01:32:03.960
The reason that he hates the sanctions is
not because they put the squeeze on the Russian

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.960
economy.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.119
He is concerned about a different set of sanctions.

01:32:08.119 --> 01:32:15.329
He’s concerned about personal sanctions
against that—that really make things difficult

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:20.710
for him and his friends who are banned from
entry to this country, who are banned from

01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:25.739
having assets in this country, and who are
essentially banned from doing any business

01:32:25.739 --> 01:32:30.250
involving U.S. currency, which really hampers
their style.

01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:37.380
MICHAEL KIRK - So let’s take ourselves to
the summer of 2016.

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:48.599
Why does Vladimir Putin, really in 2015 and
in the spring of 2016, initiate, unleash the

01:32:48.599 --> 01:32:57.260
hounds if that’s what he did, decide to
go in to, invade the presidential election

01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.030
in the United States of America in 2016?

01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:02.670
MASHA GESSEN - A couple of things.

01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:14.199
One is that Russia has actually made a habit
of being a disruptive force in Western elections

01:33:14.199 --> 01:33:15.900
for a few years now.

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:22.170
It didn’t begin with the American presidential
election.

01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:28.670
A better way to ask the question might be,
why wouldn’t Russia try to meddle in American

01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:32.400
elections when it’s made a habit of meddling
in democratic elections?

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:40.530
Now, the reasons for meddling in elections
are obvious, and I would actually begin with

01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:43.869
psychological reasons rather than strategic
reasons.

01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:48.449
The psychological reason is that Putin is
really and truly convinced, and the people

01:33:48.449 --> 01:33:52.949
around him are really and truly convinced,
that democracy is an unsound way of running

01:33:52.949 --> 01:33:54.139
things.

01:33:54.139 --> 01:33:56.430
It is messy.

01:33:56.430 --> 01:34:06.900
It is, as he saw with Bush and Gore, doesn’t
run very well, and it also probably isn't

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:10.960
as honest as everybody says, right?

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:21.489
In fact, when you ask a Russian official or
a Russian patriot about rigged Russian elections,

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:24.510
they will always say, “You think your elections
are so honest?”

01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:27.969
That’s a sense of relief.

01:34:27.969 --> 01:34:30.880
It’s not, you know, this bit of—it’s
not hypocritical “What about-ism?”

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.480
It’s sincere “What about-ism?”

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.750
They're really arguments that democratic elections
are rigged.

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:40.460
Well, if their democratic elections are rigged,
why wouldn’t you want a part of the rigging

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:42.550
if you have an interest in the outcome?

01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:47.039
Of course Russia has an interest in the outcome
of American elections.

01:34:47.039 --> 01:34:53.830
It also has an even deeper interest in proving
that democracy is as rotten as they say it

01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:55.889
is.

01:34:55.889 --> 01:35:01.179
To prove that democracy is as rotten as they
say it is, it is good to help it along in

01:35:01.179 --> 01:35:05.250
becoming more rotten.

01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:11.969
The other thing is that I think in this country,
we’ve come to imagine the Russian system

01:35:11.969 --> 01:35:21.289
of meddling as a well-oiled machine or a well-commanded
army.

01:35:21.289 --> 01:35:23.019
That’s not what it is at all.

01:35:23.019 --> 01:35:32.110
There are a lot of technically savvy and not
so savvy people who want to get federal grants,

01:35:32.110 --> 01:35:42.989
and the Kremlin throws a lot of money at organizations
that will sell a good pitch of being able

01:35:42.989 --> 01:35:48.380
to meddle in something or wreak some sort
of havoc somewhere, where havoc ought to be

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.550
wreaked, right?

01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:55.920
It’s not so much that Putin sends out an
army of hackers; it’s that there are groups

01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.199
of hackers who want to take the initiative
of doing something really awesome, which is,

01:36:00.199 --> 01:36:06.480
of course, how we get two different groups
hacking the Democratic National Committee

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.270
at roughly the same time, without apparently
being aware of each other.

01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:12.060
MICHAEL KIRK - Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.

01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:17.820
MASHA GESSEN - Right, Cozy Bear and Fancy
Bear.

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:23.309
The whole thing is self-perpetuating and messy
in different sorts of ways.

01:36:23.309 --> 01:36:27.140
But of course there's also the element of
his personal hatred for Hillary Clinton, and

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.360
it’s not just hate her.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:33.719
I think it’s like Hillary Clinton was impossible
as a U.S. president.

01:36:33.719 --> 01:36:38.679
To imagine that he would have to deal with
her as a senior partner, a woman—I mean,

01:36:38.679 --> 01:36:44.929
he already has to deal with [German Chancellor
Angela] Merkel.

01:36:44.929 --> 01:36:52.210
The lengths that he has gone to to assert
his masculine dominance over Merkel is amazing.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:57.660
He literally sicced dogs on her.

01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:07.150
He has made indecent jokes in front of her,
just to try to discomfort her.

01:37:07.150 --> 01:37:13.739
He hates dealing with a strong woman, and
one as president of the United States would

01:37:13.739 --> 01:37:14.800
be just awful.

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.800
I don’t think he ever believed that he was
going to be able to help get Trump into office.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:28.650
I think in that sense, the people who prepared
his briefs read all the same sources as we

01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:29.659
do.

01:37:29.659 --> 01:37:35.650
They were just as convinced that Hillary Clinton
was going to win the American election as

01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:41.179
The New York Times was convinced that she
was going to win the American election.

01:37:41.179 --> 01:37:48.269
MICHAEL KIRK - So in 2008 and other times,
it was obviously espionage, and everybody

01:37:48.269 --> 01:37:49.889
steals everything from everybody.

01:37:49.889 --> 01:37:56.960
It’s when it’s activated through WikiLeaks
and others that it changes into pure politics?

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:05.409
MASHA GESSEN - Well, that’s where it gets
really—I mean, we don’t know, right?

01:38:05.409 --> 01:38:16.639
I think that Julian Assange has his own megalomaniacal
views of his role in the world.

01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:22.300
He’s certainly alone against the entire
world.

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:27.659
Who made the decision to release the products
of the leaks at that particular time?

01:38:27.659 --> 01:38:31.590
I think there's actually every indication
it was Assange.

01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:33.130
How long had he been sitting on that material?

01:38:33.130 --> 01:38:38.900
Did he get it on the eve of the leak, or months
and months before?

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.610
We actually don’t know.

01:38:42.610 --> 01:38:49.679
MICHAEL KIRK - One question in passing.

01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:55.739
Nobody’s actually reached out and tried
to stop Putin along this long narrative we’ve

01:38:55.739 --> 01:38:59.440
been discussing, that we know of.

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.459
When Ukraine happens, we don’t fire back
cyber stuff or close a bank.

01:39:04.459 --> 01:39:05.459
...

01:39:05.459 --> 01:39:12.370
With the lethal arming of Ukrainian rebels
or Ukrainian soldiers, one might have said,

01:39:12.370 --> 01:39:15.440
“Well, we’ve stepped up to him and stood
up to him,” but maybe not.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:20.020
And, as you have articulated, it might have
pissed him off, and off we go again further

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.139
and further along.

01:39:21.139 --> 01:39:22.390
We get here, we know it.

01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:25.159
[Then-Director of National Intelligence James]
Clapper knows it.

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:26.790
Eventually the FBI knows it.

01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:28.100
Certainly Obama knows it.

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.289
And there were certainly arguments: “We’ve
got to push back here.

01:39:31.289 --> 01:39:33.329
We’ve got to let him know.”

01:39:33.329 --> 01:39:38.030
From what you know about Putin, and what you’ve
been talking about this afternoon, how would

01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:41.329
Putin have reacted if there would have been
pushback?

01:39:41.329 --> 01:39:49.519
MASHA GESSEN - Again, it’s very hard to
argue a counterfactual, and I don’t think

01:39:49.519 --> 01:39:53.849
that Putin’s reaction should be the consideration.

01:39:53.849 --> 01:39:59.020
I think we have known for a very, very long
time that Putin is dead set on a particular

01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:01.119
course, and he’s going to pursue it.

01:40:01.119 --> 01:40:06.250
When he gets very strong pushback, he steps
back, and then he comes back again in the

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:11.090
exact same direction, doing the exact same
thing.

01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:14.880
The question should not be, what does Putin
do?

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:20.199
Obviously it’s responsible to consider it,
but it’s not terribly complicated to predict

01:40:20.199 --> 01:40:21.199
what he is going to do.

01:40:21.199 --> 01:40:29.040
The question should be, what are our values,
and what do we do in accordance with our values

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.750
in this situation?

01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:34.860
The sanctions, I think, are a very good example,
right?

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:40.130
The sanctions, as a strategic move, are a
failure, and a predictable failure.

01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:45.520
The sanctions, as an expression of American
values, wouldn’t have been a failure if

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.820
they had been framed and implemented that
way, right?

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:51.159
It is wrong to do business with a dictator.

01:40:51.159 --> 01:40:55.780
It is wrong to do business with a head of
state or with a state that carries out the

01:40:55.780 --> 01:41:00.679
first forcible annexation of land in Europe
since World War II.

01:41:00.679 --> 01:41:03.590
In accordance with those considerations, what
does the United States do?

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:05.590
It probably introduces similar sanctions.

01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:13.800
Doesn’t do it step by step the way it was
done, because it is not gradually more and

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.869
more wrong to do business with that kind of
state.

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:18.869
It is instantly wrong to do business with
that kind of state.

01:41:18.869 --> 01:41:24.039
So you introduce sanctions all at once, and
perhaps in somewhat different areas, or perhaps

01:41:24.039 --> 01:41:25.039
not.

01:41:25.039 --> 01:41:28.340
But you don’t do it step by step, because
the step-by-step process was intended to show

01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:31.080
Putin that we mean business, and he has to
stop.

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.489
Like hell he’s going to stop, right?

01:41:33.489 --> 01:41:37.090
That’s not the kind of pushback that will
make him stop.

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:42.840
You know, again, there's also basic misunderstanding
that he thinks that making life worse for

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.699
his people—I mean, we think that making
life worse for Russians is going to make Putin

01:41:47.699 --> 01:41:48.699
stop.

01:41:48.699 --> 01:41:54.429
He has been making life worse for Russians
for years, and it certainly hasn’t made

01:41:54.429 --> 01:41:56.110
him stop.

01:41:56.110 --> 01:42:04.219
MICHAEL KIRK - So what do you think Trump—what
do you think Putin thinks of Trump?

01:42:04.219 --> 01:42:05.219
…

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:10.210
MASHA GESSEN - Oh, he very clearly sees Trump
as a buffoon.

01:42:10.210 --> 01:42:14.500
Trump is, in some ways, the expression of
everything that Putin disdains.

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:18.270
He disdains lack of control.

01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:25.050
One thing that he also has cultivated as part
of his image is his never betraying emotions.

01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:26.050
That’s not true.

01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:33.119
He actually betrays emotions quite a lot,
but his idea of himself is somebody who has

01:42:33.119 --> 01:42:42.099
a flat affect and purposefully never shows
any emotions and is always calculated in everything

01:42:42.099 --> 01:42:43.400
he does and says.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.559
Also not true, but that’s how he thinks
of himself.

01:42:46.559 --> 01:42:49.630
Trump is the exact opposite of that.

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:58.690
I mean, I think that that kind of lack of
control over his words and actions and emotions

01:42:58.690 --> 01:43:03.380
and reactions makes Putin look down on him.

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:09.179
And I think, at this point, Putin feels also
a little bit betrayed, because along with

01:43:09.179 --> 01:43:14.429
much of the media establishment, and certainly
much of Russian media, he has bought the idea

01:43:14.429 --> 01:43:16.530
that he elected Trump.

01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:17.579
He loves that idea.

01:43:17.579 --> 01:43:21.989
He took a couple of victory laps after the
election.

01:43:21.989 --> 01:43:26.100
And now Trump hasn’t delivered.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:33.730
In a way, Russia is worse off with Trump in
office than it was with Obama in office.

01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:34.730
MICHAEL KIRK - Because?

01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:36.340
MASHA GESSEN - Sanctions remain in place.

01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.880
There's no sign that they will ever be removed.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.170
Trump is less predictable.

01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:45.440
Obama was always—you could basically easily
predict that he was going to go for the least

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.070
engagement possible in any given situation.

01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:51.050
It’s not true of Trump.

01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:55.310
Trump liked firing 59 Tomahawk missiles at
Syria.

01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:58.239
Trump loved dropping the mother of all bombs
in Afghanistan.

01:43:58.239 --> 01:44:00.590
It looks really good on television.

01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:07.780
As Trump gets pushed into a corner, what is
he going to do to make himself to look good

01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:09.099
on television again?

01:44:09.099 --> 01:44:14.079
Putin understands that kind of thinking very,
very well.

01:44:14.079 --> 01:44:22.890
As we speak, things are getting pretty rocky
in Syria between Russia and the U.S.

01:44:22.890 --> 01:44:30.230
I was just in Moscow recently, and Russian
television is talking about how Trump hasn’t

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:32.949
sort of made good on his promises.

01:44:32.949 --> 01:44:38.289
Russian television is also spending a lot
of time on Syria, on how Russia is waging

01:44:38.289 --> 01:44:48.420
a heroic war against ISIS and Syria, and American-backed
terrorist forces are pushing back.

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:50.869
That’s the narrative.

01:44:50.869 --> 01:44:57.539
America is backing terrorist forces in Syria,
and Russia is waging war against them.

01:44:57.539 --> 01:45:02.560
It’s hard to get Russians mobilized behind
the Syrian effort.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.849
It hasn’t been nearly as popular as Ukraine.

01:45:05.849 --> 01:45:08.329
But it’s important to Putin personally.

01:45:08.329 --> 01:45:10.719
And he will not step back from it.

01:45:10.719 --> 01:45:18.980
MIKE WISER - So one of the questions is by
2016 election, there's a lot of talk of Russian

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.489
botnets, propaganda, influence on social media.

01:45:22.489 --> 01:45:28.230
How does that happen?

01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:34.929
Going back to 2011 and 2012, the Russian government,
what does Putin see when, at that point, it’s

01:45:34.929 --> 01:45:40.409
Facebook and social media seem to be driving
protests, change and the Arab Spring?

01:45:40.409 --> 01:45:46.860
Is there a moment where they're reconsidering
tactics, are realizing the power and the danger

01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:49.710
of social media after 2012?

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:53.250
MASHA GESSEN - I wouldn’t overemphasize
it.

01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:59.210
I was just talking recently to Adrian Chen,
who did that wonderful story on the Russian

01:45:59.210 --> 01:46:04.019
troll factory, and he said, “If I had known
that the intelligence agencies were going

01:46:04.019 --> 01:46:10.250
to use my article so prominently in their
report, I would have emphasized how incompetent

01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:12.929
they are.”

01:46:12.929 --> 01:46:18.369
It’s not all that we imagine it to be.

01:46:18.369 --> 01:46:19.889
They did catch onto social media.

01:46:19.889 --> 01:46:27.519
They caught onto social media late, and not
every agency has even figured out that social

01:46:27.519 --> 01:46:28.849
media exists.

01:46:28.849 --> 01:46:35.260
When the political crackdown began, they didn’t
employ social media at all in their investigations.

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:43.320
They would go through people’s printed out
photographs and handwritten notes to try to

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.320
figure out context.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:50.960
They never went online to try to figure out
how to crack down on people’s actual networks.

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:54.500
So it’s—they have a lot of money to throw
around.

01:46:54.500 --> 01:47:00.429
They are interested in increasing their electronic
influence around the world.

01:47:00.429 --> 01:47:01.429
This is true.

01:47:01.429 --> 01:47:06.340
And there are some companies that are enterprising
in sort of absorbing that money and doing

01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:10.540
stuff for that money, and they have no scruples
about what they do.

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:16.940
But to imagine it as a concerted effort and
as sort of an all-out war on Western democracy

01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:20.530
through high-tech means gives them a little
bit too much credit.

01:47:20.530 --> 01:47:26.659
MIKE WISER - But does he change his approach
even inside Russia after those protests?

01:47:26.659 --> 01:47:29.679
How does Putin change once he sees all those
people in the street?

01:47:29.679 --> 01:47:34.730
MASHA GESSEN - Oh, well, no, what changed
when he saw people in the streets was actually

01:47:34.730 --> 01:47:36.520
much more conventional.

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.619
They started arresting people.

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:40.099
They changed the laws.

01:47:40.099 --> 01:47:49.050
They changed the laws to enable them to prosecute
anybody for perceived violations of public

01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:50.460
assembly laws.

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:58.030
So it used to be that—I mean, the laws were
very restrictive in the first place, right?

01:47:58.030 --> 01:48:04.369
You had to get a permit to hold a demonstration,
and on that permit you had to indicate how

01:48:04.369 --> 01:48:07.550
many people were coming to the demonstration,
and if the number of people who came to the

01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:13.910
demonstration exceeded the number of people
on the permit, then you went to jail for 15

01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:14.910
days.

01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:18.170
But that still only hit the organizers of
these protests, right?

01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:22.530
So that’s what happened, for example, after
the first protest, the first large protest.

01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:27.380
People had a permit for 300 people because
that’s how many people used to show up,

01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:29.750
and 10,000 people showed up.

01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:36.039
So the people whose names were on the permit
application went to jail for 15 days for all

01:48:36.039 --> 01:48:37.550
those people who showed up.

01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:43.179
What they did, when Putin cracked down, is
they changed those laws to be able to prosecute

01:48:43.179 --> 01:48:49.889
anybody who participated in the protests for
violations.

01:48:49.889 --> 01:48:54.199
That is a basic instrument of state terror.

01:48:54.199 --> 01:49:00.550
You have to create the mechanism of random
prosecutions, because by definition, you can't

01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:04.020
apply a law like that uniformly.

01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:10.170
If 50,000 people come to a protest, you can't
arrest 50,000 people.

01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:11.849
You can only arrest some of them.

01:49:11.849 --> 01:49:15.630
You certainly can't send 50,000 people without
reinstating the Gulag.

01:49:15.630 --> 01:49:19.369
You can't send 50,000 people to prison colonies,
put them through the courts, etc., etc., so

01:49:19.369 --> 01:49:23.710
you have to pick out a few to make the threat
credible to the many.

01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:26.659
But they can't be the leaders, right?

01:49:26.659 --> 01:49:28.010
They have to be ordinary people.

01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:30.230
So they did that.

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:33.880
And they prosecuted—at this point, the number
of people who have been prosecuted in connection

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:40.790
with the 2012 protests is over 30, and most
of them have gone to jail for three or four

01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:41.790
years.

01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:47.850
These are just ordinary people, right, going
to jail for peaceful protests.

01:49:47.850 --> 01:49:50.010
They're picked out at random, and they're
picked out at random times.

01:49:50.010 --> 01:49:52.889
It can be two years after the protest.

01:49:52.889 --> 01:49:59.690
They say, “We found videotape of you beating
up an officer,” and then that person is

01:49:59.690 --> 01:50:00.690
picked up.

01:50:00.690 --> 01:50:01.690
So that’s one thing they did.

01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:12.340
Another thing they did is the “foreign agents
law,” which creates unbearable burdens for

01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:17.159
functioning of any NGO [nongovernmental organization]
that receives foreign funding.

01:50:17.159 --> 01:50:22.579
Basically they’ve decimated civil society
through doing this, and they’ve prosecuted

01:50:22.579 --> 01:50:31.349
a lot of people from various organizations
for failing to register as foreign agents.

01:50:31.349 --> 01:50:37.210
They’ve paralyzed the work of many organizations,
basically, with these prosecutions.

01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:41.150
Let me just finish.

01:50:41.150 --> 01:50:44.230
The third thing they did is the anti-gay campaign.

01:50:44.230 --> 01:50:51.690
The anti-gay campaign is, it’s much more
of a sort of standard scapegoating campaign.

01:50:51.690 --> 01:50:56.900
But queer is a perfect stand-in for everything
that Putin perceives the protesters to be.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:01.849
They're foreign; they're other; they are something
that didn’t exist in the Soviet Union.

01:51:01.849 --> 01:51:06.739
We've only had queers since the Soviet Union
collapsed.

01:51:06.739 --> 01:51:12.380
They're a stand-in for everything Western
and everything imported.

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:18.300
And it gets traction with sort of this desire
to return to an imaginary past with the traditional

01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.010
values, whatever they were.

01:51:20.010 --> 01:51:26.480
That’s also unleashed a lot of violence
on people who are perceived to be gay.

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:31.130
So that channels a lot of the violent impulses
in the population.

01:51:31.130 --> 01:51:35.770
MIKE WISER - So what does Putin want now?

01:51:35.770 --> 01:51:37.119
He started wanting respect from Bush.

01:51:37.119 --> 01:51:38.690
But where are we at this point?

01:51:38.690 --> 01:51:40.260
What's his approach to the West?

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:42.019
MASHA GESSEN - Oh, he still wants the same
thing.

01:51:42.019 --> 01:51:45.489
He still wants a bipolar world.

01:51:45.489 --> 01:51:49.820
The Syria story is actually a perfect example
of how this unfolded.

01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:55.829
You know, Putin’s happiest moment came in
September 2013, when he hijacked Syria.

01:51:55.829 --> 01:52:02.510
If you recall, Obama said there was a red
line, and then he couldn’t get congressional

01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:04.079
support for intervention in Syria.

01:52:04.079 --> 01:52:11.840
Then he decided not to do it without congressional
support, and he basically was losing face.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:19.039
Putin stepped in and allowed him to save face
and said that he was going to negotiate a

01:52:19.039 --> 01:52:22.210
chemical disarmament with [Bashar al-]Assad.

01:52:22.210 --> 01:52:30.489
He wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, which
the Times published, that was just perfect

01:52:30.489 --> 01:52:39.110
Soviet use of American rhetoric against the
United States, calling out the U.S. for its

01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:41.120
willingness to violate international law.

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:50.690
I mean, this is the man who annexed huge chunks
of neighboring countries.

01:52:50.690 --> 01:52:54.179
So that was—he was on top of the world then.

01:52:54.179 --> 01:52:59.309
And then, a year later, suddenly he is an
international pariah.

01:52:59.309 --> 01:53:03.610
Nobody comes to his party.

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:05.150
He’s under sanctions.

01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:09.949
I mean, Ukraine, he could have anticipated
that there would be a strong reaction.

01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:14.230
But the anti-gay campaign, he certainly never
anticipated that there would be an international

01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:16.280
outrage over it.

01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:21.749
So he comes back to the U.S. for the 70th
anniversary of the United Nations, Sept. 20,

01:53:21.749 --> 01:53:28.070
2015, with a proposal.

01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:31.820
He spoke at the General Assembly of the United
Nations, and he basically articulated his

01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:32.820
proposal.

01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:38.620
His proposal was that a new international
coalition, an anti-ISIS coalition modeled

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:45.039
after the anti-Hitler coalition should be
formed.

01:53:45.039 --> 01:53:51.560
What he means is, because the Soviet Union
was part of the anti-Hitler coalition, the

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:58.019
Soviet Union got to be a superpower and got
to have Eastern Europe.

01:53:58.019 --> 01:54:01.139
He wants the same thing.

01:54:01.139 --> 01:54:05.840
He wants to enter into this coalition with
the United States and get to be a superpower

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:11.510
again, and also take parts of the world that
he wants, which is not necessarily former

01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:15.530
Soviet territories, but certainly what he’s
already taken and some more.

01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:19.300
Obama didn’t even meet with him.

01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:24.310
He was completely snubbed.

01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:32.280
He went back to Moscow humiliated, untended
to.

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.940
Russia started bombing Syria a week later,
and has been ever since.

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:44.449
The war, Russia’s participation in the war
in Syria, is basically an attempt to blackmail

01:54:44.449 --> 01:54:49.350
the United States into giving Russia its superpower
status back.

01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:57.829
JIM GILMORE - I think you missed the back
in September of 2004, Beslan and what it represented,

01:54:57.829 --> 01:55:11.620
and why it was important to understand about
what was going on there.

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:17.099
MASHA GESSEN - Beslan was, if you could imagine,
an even more shocking terrorist attack than

01:55:17.099 --> 01:55:19.630
the explosions that killed people in their
sleep.

01:55:19.630 --> 01:55:29.719
That was Beslan, the siege of a school in
the south of Russia, where nearly 1,000 people

01:55:29.719 --> 01:55:31.309
were taken hostage.

01:55:31.309 --> 01:55:37.219
Then more than 300 people died, most of them
children.

01:55:37.219 --> 01:55:46.510
As we learned, thanks to an independent investigation
carried out over the next couple years, the

01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:55.699
deaths of those children were really the FSB’s
doing, the federal troops’ fault.

01:55:55.699 --> 01:56:00.210
They shelled the school at point-blank range.

01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:04.360
They fired at it from tanks.

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:13.809
A lot of the children who burned alive because
of a fire that raged, because the school was

01:56:13.809 --> 01:56:19.000
shelled at point blank range.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.110
I think that they were trying to do everything
to maximize the number of casualties, to maximize

01:56:23.110 --> 01:56:24.110
the shock effect.

01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:33.260
It’s also possible that they were just so
inhumane that they would just do it without

01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:37.139
even having that goal in mind.

01:56:37.139 --> 01:56:46.880
But Putin used Beslan as a pretext for canceling
gubernatorial elections.

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:52.329
He framed it as an antiterrorism measure.

01:56:52.329 --> 01:56:57.400
It was a cynical move, because clearly his
very detailed decree in canceling gubernatorial

01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:03.510
elections had been prepared before Beslan
happened.

01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:10.039
But at the same time, it also expresses, I
think, his basic belief that anything democratic

01:57:10.039 --> 01:57:17.140
is always messy, and the way to respond to
extreme violence and to extreme disorder is

01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:20.150
to create more dictatorial powers.

01:57:20.150 --> 01:57:25.510
MICHAEL KIRK - So now my last question, which
is, are we at war?

01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:27.139
Is he at war with us?

01:57:27.139 --> 01:57:30.539
MASHA GESSEN - He is.

01:57:30.539 --> 01:57:36.909
Putin has portrayed and the Kremlin-controlled
Russian media have portrayed both the wars

01:57:36.909 --> 01:57:41.760
in Ukraine and the wars here as proxy wars
against the United States.

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:47.309
Russia does not perceive itself as being at
war with Ukraine.

01:57:47.309 --> 01:57:53.809
It perceives itself as being at war with the
United States by proxy of Ukraine.

01:57:53.809 --> 01:57:58.440
And it certainly doesn’t perceive itself
as being at war with ISIS, even though it

01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:01.420
says that it’s firing at ISIS fighters.

01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:09.460
It perceives itself as being at war with forces
that are backed by the United States in Syria.

01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:14.130
They're quite open about it, on television.

01:58:14.130 --> 01:58:19.949
It would be beneath Russia’s station to
go to war with Syria or to go to war with

01:58:19.949 --> 01:58:20.949
Ukraine.

01:58:20.949 --> 01:58:24.420
Only the United States is big enough to go
to war against, and only the United States

01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:32.600
is grand enough to mobilize people enough
to have the kind of popularity that Putin

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:33.450
has come to depend upon. …
