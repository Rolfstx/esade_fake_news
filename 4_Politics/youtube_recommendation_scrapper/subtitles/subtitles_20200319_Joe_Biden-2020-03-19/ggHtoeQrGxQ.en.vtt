00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:03.002
-You're a gentleman for
coming at such a last notice --

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.737
last-minute notice
to our program.

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:07.440
Can you --
Walk us through this, please.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.509
-Well, first,
I'll say one thing.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.477
As a surgeon,
I have learned in my career,

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.813
if you tell people the truth
that's gonna hurt a little bit,

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.014
they get prepared...

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.350
So, there's a lot of good news
out there,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.752
but some of the information that
we're getting is a little scary.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.186
So I'll give you both sides.
-Okay.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:22.555
-And then I think
people can act.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.290
But the big message here
is we can do this.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.058
We've mobilized
as a nation before.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:29.229
We can, without any question,
buy ourselves the time we need

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.163
for the public health system
to get better,

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:33.032
for ERs to catch up
to get enough ventilators,

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.135
for the government to figure out
what they're going to do.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.837
But only if the people who can
hear my voice right now act,

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.438
are we gonna buy ourselves
the time?

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:42.409
Because this pandemic
is spreading so rapidly

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.610
that a lot of our leaders
are of the belief

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.513
that we're gonna have most of
the population of this country

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.081
infected within a year.

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.083
-Hmm.
-Now, that's a problem.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:53.586
But it's also a problem because
we don't have the resources

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.789
to take care of half the people
in the country.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.623
So by slowing down transmission,

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.459
we completely change
what the future can be.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.961
-So we have to slow down
the transmission.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.363
That's our goal right now.
What is coronavirus?

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:07.100
-So, there was a bat virus,
we believe,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.567
that got married to a virus

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:09.969
that's more comfortable
in humans,

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.704
and those two viruses had kids,

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.372
and they sort of
pieced it together,

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.875
and one of those kids
had the ability

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.144
to infect us in ways
we never imagined possible.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.079
It probably happened around
that wet market in Wuhan

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.048
that everyone talks about,
but now this new virus

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.582
is something
we've never seen before.

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:25.117
So no one
actually recognized it.

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:26.752
Our immune system
can't fight it off.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.788
So we don't have any firewalls
to protect us.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.390
Thankfully, it doesn't seem
to affect young people at all.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.860
Most of your viewership,
folks under the age of 60,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.361
are gonna do just great
with this thing.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.496
There hasn't been a death
in a kid under the age of 10.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.198
-Oh, okay.
-So fantastic.

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:40.599
It doesn't seem to hurt
pregnant women quite as badly.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.001
So that's all good news.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.636
The bad news is that
folks who are older --

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.804
Once you get past 60,
if you have other illnesses,

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:49.308
hypertension, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes,

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.876
lung problems,
so if you smoke --

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.745
If you're smoking or vaping,
please stop.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.347
This is a good excuse.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.248
-How can people
not panic about this?

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:58.484
-Well, you don't panic
for two reasons.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.620
One, you help other people,
which always works.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.888
Do folks a favor,

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.789
and it takes a little bit
of the pressure off you.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.124
But if you actually
know the facts --

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.893
What you fear the most
is what you don't understand.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.694
-You know what I did see
that I really enjoyed?

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:11.530
I follow you on Instagram.
@Dr-Oz.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.167
You put up this what's called
a survival protocol.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.504
Check this out.
This is really interesting.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:22.908
If you want to, go to his
Instagram, Dr. Oz's Instagram.

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:24.610
Or where else do you have this?
On your website?

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.712
-It's at droz.com. It's --
We got stuff on YouTube.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.214
But let me just explain
something real quick.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.848
I wanted people
to have extra steps.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.284
If there are things you can do,

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.019
you'll be perseverating
in your mind,

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.588
ruminating about
what's going on.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.523
So there are lifestyle things
you gotta do

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:38.824
like sleep and exercise.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:41.160
There are things you gotta do
in terms of hygiene.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.294
When you wash your hands,

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:43.596
most people don't wash
their hands right.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:46.633
Show me how you wash your hands.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.968
[ Laughter ]

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.371
That's terrible!
-Right. Like that. Like this.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.205
-No. I'm gonna show you how
a surgeon washes their hands.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:54.606
-Cool.
-Because what --

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.242
You're washing the back
of your wrists, right?

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.877
-Yeah.
-That's not important.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.311
It's your fingers
that touch your face.

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:00.779
So, after you get the soap
on your hands,

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.182
you do the Turkish twist.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.882
You go like this.
Rub the fingers in there.

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:05.217
-Okay.
-Right?

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.885
And then you gotta do
the Tony thumb, right?

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:09.288
Rub the fingers, the thumbs.
Opposing digits.

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.223
Seriously. We learned this
in medical school.

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:13.025
-I know. I just don't
want to end up a meme.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.628
-Okay.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.397
And then grease the palm.
Grease the palm.

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:19.866
-Yeah.
-All right. Both sides.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.334
That's 20 seconds.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.735
Wash your hands,
use the paper towel

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:25.004
to turn off the sink and to get
the door open and exit.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.705
-Really?
-But if you do that,

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.641
that one issue by itself
halves the chance

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.176
of you getting the coronavirus,
we believe.

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.710
Just washing your hands.
-Just washing your hands.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.314
That's it. 'Cause I just --
This is good to know.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:36.181
This is good stuff to know.
And exercise?

00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.651
-Exercise counts.
You got to eat the right foods.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.152
And you do have to stock up

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:41.387
because here's
what's going to happen.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.588
Let me paint the picture
for you here.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.156
So, everyone's traveling around.

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:46.258
They've been in public events
over the last couple days,

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:47.827
so they may have already
gotten the coronavirus.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:51.697
So if you start to feel a high
fever or a lot of lethargy,

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.333
tiredness with that.
-Okay.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.768
-If you have a dry cough --
or some people get diarrhea --

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.970
then there's a reasonable chance
you got coronavirus.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.838
So please don't go rushing off
to the emergency room.

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:01.774
You'll completely overwhelm
the system.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.709
Just call your doc
if you're worried.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.277
-Stay home.
-Stay home, though.

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:07.246
Just socially separate yourself
from everybody else.

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:10.283
Social distancing
is the entire solution here.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.184
If we can just accomplish
that one goal,

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:14.386
then we'll be over the top on
this baby, because then we'll

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.789
be able to slow down
the progression of this.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.691
And I'm so optimistic about the
treatments we're figuring out.

00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:23.062
The work-around immunizations
is progressing nicely.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:25.130
It's all good news there,
but you got to buy us time.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.699
People watching right now
can do that.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.934
No one else can do it for you.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.368
-Thank you so much
for coming on.

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:31.237
You're a gentleman. Thank you.
Dr. Oz, everybody.
