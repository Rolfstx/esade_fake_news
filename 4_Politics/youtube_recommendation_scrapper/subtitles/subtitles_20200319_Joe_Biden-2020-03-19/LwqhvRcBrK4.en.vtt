00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.240
The Chinese government has
one of the most extensive

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.270
propaganda networks in the
world inside the country,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.610
but it also aggressively
works to influence

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.971
how it’s perceived
outside its borders.

00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:15.975
“Good morning, President Xi!”

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.170
China has invested billions
into bolstering its image abroad.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.080
Its state-run news outlets
push out messages in English

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.000
around the clock —

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.330
“You’re watching CGTN.”

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.045
“Live in Beijing.”

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:26.812
“From Nairobi.”

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:27.855
“Washington, D.C.”

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:29.730
— and its diplomats
have flocked to Twitter

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.810
in the last year.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.970
But what happens when this
massive P.R. apparatus

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.240
has to do major
damage control?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.280
We analyzed
thousands of tweets

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.830
from Chinese state media
and official accounts

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.630
and found three
dominant messages

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.970
China wants to
project to the world.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.770
Here’s what we learned.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.380
A novel coronavirus hit
the Chinese city of Wuhan

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.580
in January.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.710
Early whistleblowers
were silenced.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950
People were angry about
a government cover-up.

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:05.040
But in the majority
of tweets we analyzed,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.360
state-owned publications pushed
a much more optimistic view,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.400
promoting what they said
was an effective response.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.125
They are sharing
videos like this.

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:22.680
The Chinese Communist Party
refers to this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.140
as positive energy,
only focusing

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.970
on the bright side
of an issue.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.700
China did take drastic measures
to try and stem the outbreak,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.010
but that’s the only story
China wants the world to see.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.180
And state media is
eager to run praise

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
from foreign experts to
back up China’s successes.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.190
One tweet from
state media that

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.380
did reveal Chinese
citizens’ discontent —

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:53.010
— it was quickly deleted.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.630
Once the virus spread
across the world,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.250
China started
positioning itself

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.280
as being at the forefront
of fighting the pandemic.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.350
It presented itself
as a partner,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.490
a grateful recipient, and more
recently a selfless leader,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.400
highlighting large donations
from Chinese companies

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.663
and the government.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.070
China hasn’t
typically disparaged

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.020
other countries’
responses to the virus,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.377
with one exception —
the United States.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.710
“President Donald
Trump has been

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.870
accused of denying,
downplaying and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.760
outright rejecting the concerns
over the Covid-19 outbreak.”

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.280
Another thing we noticed are
Chinese outlets disputing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.020
the origin of the virus.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.880
It all started
in late February

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.370
with a renowned
Chinese epidemiologist.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:47.580
Around the same time, the
C.D.C. reported the first case

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.310
in the United States
with an unknown origin.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.890
A screenshot of the
announcement incorrectly

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.340
translated in Chinese
began to trend online

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.450
and was untouched by
Chinese government censors.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.920
And a high-ranking
government spokesperson

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.334
actively pushed disinformation
about where the virus came from.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.980
A government giving an
optimistic spin to bad news

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.440
is not unique.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.230
“We want to go big, go solid.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.905
The country is very strong.
We’ve never been so strong.”

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:23.140
But the scale of the Chinese
propaganda machine is,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.350
and it’s clear that
it’s being deployed

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.540
to try and tell the
world a new story

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.170
about the
coronavirus pandemic.
