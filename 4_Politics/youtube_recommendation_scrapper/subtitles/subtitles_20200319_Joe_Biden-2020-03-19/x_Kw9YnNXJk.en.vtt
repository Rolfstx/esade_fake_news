00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.534
President Obama: Hey!

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:04.037
Audience: Hey!

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.739
President Obama: Habari Zenu!

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:09.542
(applause)

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.479
Wakenya mpo?

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.914
(applause)

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.618
It is great
to be back in Kenya.

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:23.556
Thank you so much for this
extraordinary welcome.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:28.695
I know it took a few years,
but as President I try to keep

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.465
my promises, and I said I was
going to come, and I'm here.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.702
(applause)

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.506
Everybody, go ahead
and have a seat.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.774
I'm going to be
talking for a while.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.741
(laughter)

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.077
Relax.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:50.216
I want to thank my sister, Auma,
for a wonderful introduction.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.685
I'm so glad that she could
be with us here today.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:57.724
And it was -- as she said,
it was Auma who first

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.828
guided me through Kenya
almost 30 years ago.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.798
To President Kenyatta, I
want to thank you once again

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:07.967
for the hospitality that
you've shown to me --

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.471
(applause)

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.073
-- and for our work
together on this visit,

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.010
and for being here today.
It's a great honor.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.815
I am proud to be the
first American President to

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.550
come to Kenya --

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.654
(applause)

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.422
-- and, of course, I'm
the first Kenyan-American

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.824
to be President of
the United States.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:34.461
(laughter and applause)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.737
That goes without saying.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.538
Audience Member:
I love you, Obama!

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:46.473
President Obama:
I love you back.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.640
(applause)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.609
I do.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.180
But, as Auma was
saying, the first time

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.784
I came to Kenya, things
were a little different.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.520
When I arrived at
Kenyatta Airport,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.956
the airline lost my bags.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:06.192
(laughter)

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.061
That doesn't happen
on Air Force One.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.563
(laughter)

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.799
They always have my
luggage on Air Force One.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.968
(laughter)

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.904
As she said, Auma
picked me up in an old

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:22.809
Volkswagon Beetle, and
think the entire stay

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.078
I was here it broke down
four or five times.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.846
(laughter)

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.414
We'd be on the highway,
we'd have to call

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:33.186
the juakali -- he'd
bring us tools.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:36.556
We'd be sitting
there, waiting.

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.493
And I slept on a cot
in her apartment.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:43.863
Instead of eating at
fancy banquets with

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:50.570
the President, we were drinking
tea and eating Ugali --

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.638
(laughter)

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:57.677
-- and Sukumawiki.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.879
So there wasn't a
lot of luxury.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.483
Sometimes the
lights would go out.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.951
They still do -- is
that what someone said?

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:08.621
(laughter)

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.693
But there was something
more important than

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:19.299
luxury on that first trip,
and that was a sense of being

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.268
recognized, being seen.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:25.071
I was a young man and I was just
a few years out of University.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.774
I had worked as a community
organizer in low-income

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:30.109
neighborhoods in Chicago.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.111
I was about to go
to law school.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:36.316
And when I came here, in
many ways I was a Westerner,

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:41.854
I was an American, unfamiliar
with my father and his

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:48.428
birthplace, really disconnected
from half of my heritage.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:53.600
And at that airport, as I was
trying to find my luggage,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.737
there was a woman there who
worked for the airlines,

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.340
and she was helping
fill out the forms,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.543
and she saw my name and she
looked up and she asked

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:10.149
if I was related to my
father, who she had known.

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:17.457
And that was the first time
that my name meant something.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:20.793
(applause)

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.362
And that
was recognized.

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.063
And over the course
of several weeks,

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:26.666
I'd meet my brothers
and aunts and uncles.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:30.670
I traveled to Alego, the village
where my family was from.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.841
I saw the graves of my
father and my grandfather.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:39.345
And I learned things
about their lives that

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:42.915
I could have never
learned through books.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:48.655
And in many ways, their lives
offered snapshots of Kenya's

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:54.293
history, but they also told us
something about the future.

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:58.031
My grandfather, for example,
he was a cook for the British.

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:03.770
And as I went through some
of his belongings when

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.374
I went up-country, I found
the passbook he had

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.343
had to carry as a
domestic servant.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.315
It listed his age and
his height, his tribe,

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.985
listed the number of
teeth he had missing.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:22.288
(laughter)

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.759
And he was referred
to as a boy,

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.197
even though he was a grown
man, in that passbook.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:34.233
And he was in the King's
African Rifles during

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:37.470
the Second World War, and
was taken to the far reaches

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.974
of the British Empire --
all the way to Burma.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:46.779
And back home after the war,
he was eventually detained

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.215
for a time because he was
linked to a group that

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.217
opposed British rule.

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.653
And eventually
he was released.

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:56.189
He forged a home for
himself and his family.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.391
He earned the respect
of his village,

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:03.663
lived a life of dignity --
although he had a well-earned

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:06.766
reputation for being so strict
that everybody was scared

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:14.607
of him and he became estranged
from part of his family.

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:15.608
So that was his story.

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:18.711
And then my father came
of age as Kenyans were

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.248
pursuing independence, and
he was proud to be a part

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.283
of that liberation
generation.

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.285
And next to my
grandfather's papers,

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:29.322
I found letters that he
had written to 30 American

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.892
universities asking for a
chance to pursue his dream

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.894
and get a scholarship.

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:40.933
And ultimately, one university
gave him that chance --

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:41.934
the University in Hawaii.

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:47.907
And he would go on to get an
education and then return home.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.913
And here, at first he found
success as an economist and

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:54.914
worked with the government.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.350
But ultimately, he found
disappointment -- in part

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.787
because he couldn't reconcile
the ideas that he had

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:03.356
for his young country with
the hard realities that

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:07.493
had confronted him.

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:09.862
And I think sometimes about
what these stories tell us,

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:15.568
what the history and the past
tell us about the future.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:17.937
They show the enormous
barriers to progress that

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.674
so many Kenyans faced just
one or two generations ago.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:24.210
This is a young country.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:30.283
We were talking last
night at dinner --

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:34.620
the President's father was
the first President.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.622
We're only a
generation removed.

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:42.495
And the daily limitations --
and sometimes humiliations --

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:46.465
of colonialism --
that's recent history.

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:50.136
The corruption and cronyism
and tribalism that sometimes

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:54.607
confront young nations
-- that's recent history.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.976
But what these stories
also tell us is an arch

00:07:56.976 --> 00:08:00.546
of progress -- from foreign
rule to independence;

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.850
from isolation to education,
and engagement with

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.852
a wider world.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:11.123
It speaks of
incredible progress.

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:14.894
So we have to know
the history of Kenya,

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:20.233
just as we Americans have to
know our American history.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:24.804
All people have to understand
where they come from.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:28.374
But we also have to
remember why these lessons

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.910
are important.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.982
We know a history so that
we can learn from it.

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:38.818
We learn our history because
we understand the sacrifices

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:42.321
that were made before, so that
when we make sacrifices we

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:47.360
understand we're doing it on
behalf of future generations.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.062
There's a proverb that says,
"We have not inherited

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:52.465
this land from our forebears,
we have borrowed it from

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.800
our children."

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.069
In other words, we study
the past so it can guide

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:00.206
us into the future, and
inspire us to do better.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:04.810
And when it comes to the people
of Kenya -- particularly the

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:10.249
youth -- I believe there is no
limit to what you can achieve.

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:13.920
A young, ambitious Kenyan today
should not have to do what

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.859
my grandfather did, and
serve a foreign master.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.861
You don't need to do
what my father did,

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.430
and leave your home in order
to get a good education

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.033
and access to opportunity.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:30.536
Because of Kenya's progress,
because of your potential,

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:33.706
you can build your future
right here, right now.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:38.678
(applause)

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.216
Now, like any
country, Kenya is far

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:48.220
from perfect, but
it has come so far

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.222
in just my lifetime.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.392
After a bitter struggle,
Kenyans claimed their

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:56.095
independence just a few
years after I was born.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.331
And after decades
of one party-rule,

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:02.268
Kenya embraced a multi-party
system in the 1990s,

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.270
just as I was beginning
my own political career

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.440
in the United States.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.241
Tragically, just
under a decade ago,

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:12.244
Kenya was nearly torn apart
by violence at the same time

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:15.881
that I was running for my
first campaign for President.

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:18.084
And I remember hearing
the reports of thousands

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:21.988
of innocent people being killed
or driven from their homes.

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:26.392
And from a distance, it seemed
like the Kenya that I knew --

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:31.330
a Kenya that was able
to reach beyond ethnic

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.734
and tribal lines -- that
it might split apart

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.836
across those lines of
tribe and ethnicity.

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:39.905
But look what happened.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:43.409
The people of Kenya chose not
to be defined by the hatreds

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:45.478
of the past -- you
chose a better history.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:49.315
(applause)

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:53.319
The voices of
ordinary people,

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.490
and political leaders and civil
society did not eliminate

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.725
all these divisions, but you
addressed the divisions

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:01.360
and differences peacefully.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.362
And a new constitution
was put in place,

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:07.733
declaring that "every person
has inherent dignity -- and

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:10.770
the right to have that dignity
respected and protected."

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:16.275
A competitive election went
forward -- not without problems,

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:20.312
but without the violence
that so many had feared.

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:23.282
In other words, Kenyans
chose to stay together.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:26.318
You chose the
path of Harambee.

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:27.887
(applause)

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:34.060
And in part because of
this political stability,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.164
Kenya's economy is also emerging
-- and the entrepreneurial

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:41.801
spirit that people rely on
to survive in the streets

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:45.704
of Kibera can now be seen in new
businesses across the country.

00:11:45.704 --> 00:11:46.705
(applause)

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:50.810
From the city square
to the smallest villages,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.813
MPesa is changing the
way people use money.

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:58.451
New investment is making Kenya
a hub for regional trade.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.485
When I came here as a U.S.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:04.590
senator, I pointed out that
South Korea's economy was

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.128
the same as Kenya's when I
was born, and then was

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.030
40 times larger
than Kenya's.

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.031
Think about that.

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:15.634
It started at the same place
-- South Korea had gone here,

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.069
and Kenya was here.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.738
But today, that gap has
been cut in half just

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:20.739
in the last decade.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:22.007
(applause)

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:25.845
Which means
Kenya is making progress.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:29.014
And meanwhile, Kenya continues
to carve out a distinct place

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:32.885
in the community of nations:
As a source of peacekeepers

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:37.623
for places torn apart by
conflict, a host for refugees

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.792
driven from their homes.

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:44.263
A leader for conservation,
following the footprints

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.532
of Wangari Maathai.

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:50.603
(applause)

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.739
Kenya is one of the
places on this continent

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:59.745
that truly observes
freedom of the press,

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.447
and their fearless
journalists and courageous

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.716
civil society members.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:06.752
And in the United States, we
see the legacy of Kip Keino

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.387
every time a Kenyan wins
one of our marathons.

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:13.492
(applause)

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:15.861
And maybe the First
Lady of Kenya is going

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:16.929
to win one soon.

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:22.101
(laughter and applause)

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.235
I told the President
he has to start

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:24.370
running with his wife.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.039
(laughter)

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.140
We want him to stay fit.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.344
(laughter)

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:35.614
So there's much
to be proud of --

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:37.283
much progress
to lift up.

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.718
It's a good-news story.

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:41.921
But we also know the
progress is not complete.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:46.458
There are still problems that
shadow ordinary Kenyans every

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:50.563
day -- challenges that can
deny you your livelihood,

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.565
and sometimes deny you lives.

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:59.138
As in America -- and so many
countries around the globe --

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:03.108
economic growth has not
always been broadly shared.

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:05.377
Sometimes people at
the top do very well,

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.713
but ordinary people
still struggle.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:13.185
Today, a young child in Nyanza
Province is four times more

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:18.057
likely to die than a child
in Central Province --

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:22.194
even though they are equal in
dignity and the eyes of God.

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:24.163
That's a gap that
has to be closed.

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:25.598
(applause)

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:31.503
A girl in Rift
Valley is far less likely

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:35.841
to attend secondary school
than a girl in Nairobi.

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.843
That's a gap that
has to be closed.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:41.213
(applause)

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:44.917
Across the country,
one study shows corruption costs

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:50.556
Kenyans 250,000 jobs every
year -- because every shilling

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:54.627
that's paid as a bribe could
be put into the pocket

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.996
of somebody who's actually
doing an honest day's work.

00:14:56.996 --> 00:15:02.368
(applause)

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:08.841
And despite the hard-earned
political progress

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:12.778
that I spoke of, those
political gains still

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:15.281
have to be protected.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:18.284
New laws and restrictions
could close off the space

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:20.986
where civil society gives
individual citizens

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:23.122
a voice and holds
leaders accountable.

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:28.761
Old tribal divisions and
ethnic divisions can still

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.763
be stirred up.

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:34.933
I want to be very clear here --
a politics that's based solely

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:40.339
on tribe and ethnicity is
a politics that's doomed

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.840
to tear a country apart.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.708
(applause)

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:46.912
It is a failure
-- a failure of imagination.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:52.184
Of course, here, in Kenya,
we also know the specter

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:55.321
of terrorism has touched
far too many lives.

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:57.289
And we remember the Americans
and Kenyans who died side by

00:15:57.289 --> 00:16:00.359
side in the attack on
our embassy in the '90s.

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:04.296
We remember the innocent
Kenyans who were taken from

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.899
us at Westgate Mall.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:11.370
We weep for the nearly 150
people slaughtered at Garissa --

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.572
including so many students
who had such a bright

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:15.941
future before them.

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:19.511
We honor the memory of so
many other innocent Kenyans

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:21.513
whose lives have been
lost in this struggle.

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:30.723
So Kenya is at a crossroads
-- a moment filled with peril,

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:33.525
but also enormous promise.

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:35.527
And with the rest of
my time here today,

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:37.763
I'd like to talk about how
you can seize the moment,

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:43.836
how you can make sure we leave
behind a world that's better --

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.804
a world that we borrowed
from our children.

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:51.744
When I first came to sub-Saharan
Africa as President,

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:55.247
I made clear my strong belief
that the future of Africa

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.849
is up to Africans.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:01.687
(applause)

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:07.693
For too long, I think that
many looked to the outside

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:13.499
for salvation and focused
on somebody else being

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:17.002
at fault for the problems
of the continent.

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:19.638
And as my sister said,
ultimately we are each

00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:21.640
responsible for
our own destiny.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:27.746
And I'm here as President of
a country that sees Kenya

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:30.149
as an important partner.

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.350
(applause)

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:36.288
I'm here as a friend
who wants Kenya to succeed.

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:40.726
And the pillars of that success
are clear: Strong democratic

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:44.263
governance; development that
provides opportunity for all

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:48.367
people and not just some; a
sense of national identity that

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:53.439
rejects conflict for a future
of peace and reconciliation.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:56.308
And today, we can see that
future for Kenya on the horizon.

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:59.745
But tough choices are
going to have to be made

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.747
in order to arrive
at that destination.

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:07.286
In the United States, I always
say that what makes America

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:09.288
exceptional is not the
fact that we're perfect,

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:16.495
it's the fact that we
struggle to improve.

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:19.431
We're self-critical.

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.868
We work to live up to our
highest values and ideals,

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:25.103
knowing that we're not
always going to achieve them

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:31.810
perfectly, but we keep on
trying to perfect our union.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.547
And what's true for America
is also true for Kenya.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:40.385
You can't be complacent and
accept the world just as it is.

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:43.755
You have to imagine what the
world might be and then push

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:46.558
and work toward that future.

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:50.996
Progress requires that you
honestly confront the dark

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:57.369
corners of our own past; extend
rights and opportunities to more

00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:00.839
of your citizens; see the
differences and diversity of

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:04.276
this country as a strength, just
as we in America try to see the

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:09.481
diversity of our country as a
strength and not a weakness.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.084
So you can choose
the path to progress,

00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:17.155
but it requires making
some important choices.

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:21.760
First and foremost, it means
continuing down the path

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.596
of a strong, more
inclusive, more accountable

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:26.465
and transparent democracy.

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:31.904
(applause)

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.773
Democracy begins with a
peacefully-elected government.

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:35.908
It begins with elections.

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:38.010
But it doesn't stop
with elections.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.244
(applause)

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:44.016
So your constitution offers
a road map to governance

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.286
that's more responsive to the
people -- through protections

00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:49.655
against unchecked power,
more power in the hands

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:51.924
of local communities.

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:54.393
For this system to
succeed, there also has

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:57.129
to be space for citizens
to exercise their rights.

00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:00.232
And we saw the strength of
Kenya's civil society in the

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:02.634
last election, when
groups collected reports

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:05.904
of incitement so that violence
could be stopped before

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:08.073
it spun out of control.

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:13.645
And the ability of citizens to
organize and advocate for

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:17.816
change -- that's the oxygen
upon which democracy depends.

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:24.323
Democracy is sometimes
messy, and for leaders,

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:27.259
sometimes it's frustrating.

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:29.294
Democracy means that somebody
is always complaining

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:30.195
about something.

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:32.598
(laughter)

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:36.735
Nobody is ever happy
in a democracy about

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.571
their government.

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:43.542
If you make one person happy,
somebody else is unhappy.

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.811
Then sometimes somebody who
you made happy, later on,

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.045
now they're not happy.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:48.313
(laughter)

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:50.115
They say, what have you
done for me lately?

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:52.117
(laughter)

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:54.953
But that's the
nature of democracy.

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:57.322
That's why it works, is
because it's constantly

00:20:57.322 --> 00:21:02.828
challenging leaders to up
their game and to do better.

00:21:02.828 --> 00:21:09.635
And such civic participation
and freedom is also essential

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:11.637
for rooting out the
cancer of corruption.

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.905
Now, I want to be clear.

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:16.408
Corruption is not
unique to Kenya.

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:19.611
(laughter)

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:24.383
I mean, I want everybody
to understand that

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:30.055
there's no country that's
completely free of corruption.

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:37.496
Certainly here in the African
continent there are many

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.431
countries that deal
with this problem.

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:43.568
And I want to assure you I
speak about it wherever I go,

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:44.569
not just here in Kenya.

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:47.873
So I don't want everybody
to get too sensitive.

00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:49.508
(laughter)

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:56.214
But the fact is, too
often, here in Kenya --

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:58.917
as is true in other
places -- corruption is

00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:02.721
tolerated because that's how
things have always been done.

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:07.192
People just think that
that is sort of the normal

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:09.695
state of affairs.

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:11.897
And there was a time in
the United States where

00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:12.898
that was true, too.

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:16.401
My hometown of Chicago was
infamous for Al Capone

00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:26.311
and the Mob and organized crime
corrupting law enforcement.

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:28.547
But what happened was
that over time people got

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:33.285
fed up, and leaders
stood up and they said,

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:36.388
we're not going to
play that game anymore.

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:37.823
(applause)

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:41.159
And you changed a culture
and you changed habits.

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:46.498
Here in Kenya, it's
time to change habits,

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:49.634
and decisively
break that cycle.

00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:52.003
Because corruption
holds back every aspect

00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:54.005
of economic and civil life.

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:58.510
It's an anchor that weighs
you down and prevents

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.947
you from achieving
what you could.

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:05.417
If you need to pay a bribe and
hire somebody's brother --

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:08.019
who's not very good and
doesn't come to work --

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:10.822
in order to start a
business, well, that's

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:13.825
going to create less
jobs for everybody.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:17.763
If electricity is going to one
neighborhood because they're

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:21.433
well-connected, and not
another neighborhood,

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:24.936
that's going to limit
development of the country

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.071
as a whole.

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:30.876
(applause)

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:33.645
If someone in
public office is taking

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:39.551
a cut that they don't
deserve, that's taking away

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:42.621
from those who are
paying their fair share.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:46.124
So this is not just about
changing one law -- although

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:48.627
it's important to have
laws on the books that are

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:50.629
actually being enforced.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:57.769
It's important that not only
low-level corruption is

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:04.376
punished, but folks at the
top, if they are taking

00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:06.444
from the people, that has
to be addressed as well.

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:07.979
(applause)

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:10.582
But it's not something
that is just fixed by

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.818
laws, or that any
one person can fix.

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:16.288
It requires a commitment
by the entire nation --

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.957
leaders and citizens
-- to change habits

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.559
and to change culture.

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.094
(applause)

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:26.698
Tough laws need to
be on the books.

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:28.700
And the good news is, your
government is taking

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.735
some important steps in
the right direction.

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.737
People who break the law
and violate the public

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:35.640
trust need to be prosecuted.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.344
NGOs have to be allowed to
operate who shine a spotlight

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:40.445
on what needs to change.

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:43.081
And ordinary people have
to stand up and say,

00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:44.482
enough is enough.

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:45.450
(applause)

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.854
It's time
for a better future.

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:52.557
And as you take these steps,
I promise that America will

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:55.260
continue to be your partner
in supporting investments

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.762
in strong, democratic
institutions.

00:24:57.762 --> 00:25:00.799
(applause)

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:03.735
Now, we're also going to
work with you to pursue

00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:06.571
the second pillar of progress,
and that is development

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:09.374
that extends economic
opportunity and dignity

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:11.376
for all of Kenya's people.

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:15.747
America partners with Kenya
in areas where you're making

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:19.517
enormous progress, and we focus
on what Kenyans can do for

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:23.521
themselves and building
capacity; on entrepreneurship,

00:25:23.521 --> 00:25:27.492
where Kenya is becoming
an engine for innovation;

00:25:27.492 --> 00:25:30.996
on access to power, where Kenya
is developing clean energy that

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:35.100
can reach more people; on the
important issue of climate

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.469
change, where Kenya's
recent goal to reduce its

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:41.139
emissions has put it in the
position of being a leader

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:45.143
on the continent; on food
security, where Kenyan crops

00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:47.679
are producing more to
meet the demands of your

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:51.182
people and a global market;
and on health, where

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:53.785
Kenya has struck huge blows
against HIV/AIDS and other

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:57.322
diseases, while building up
the capacity to provide

00:25:57.322 --> 00:26:00.825
better care in
your communities.

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:03.094
America is also partnering
with you on an issue that's

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:07.232
fundamental to Kenya's future:
We are investing in youth.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.267
(applause)

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:11.369
We are investing
in the young people of Kenya

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.838
and the young people
of this continent.

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.741
Robert F. Kennedy
once said, "It is

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:19.577
a revolutionary
world that we live in,"

00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:22.747
and "it is the young
people who must take the lead."

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:23.949
(applause)

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:27.018
It's the young people
who must take the lead.

00:26:27.018 --> 00:26:29.921
So through our Young African
Leaders Initiative --

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:32.057
(applause)

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:37.762
-- we are empowering and
connecting young people from

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:40.699
across the continent who are
filled with energy and optimism

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:44.469
and idealism, and are going to
take Africa to new heights.

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:46.338
(applause)

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:48.540
And these
young people,

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.477
they're not weighted
down by the old ways.

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:55.413
They're creating a new path.

00:26:57.215 --> 00:27:00.986
And these are the elements for
success in this 21st century.

00:27:02.153 --> 00:27:03.955
To continue down this
path of progress,

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.858
it will be vital for Kenya to
recognize that no country can

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:10.228
achieve its full potential
unless it draws on the talents

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:15.667
of all its people -- and that
must include the half of Kenyans

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:19.237
-- maybe a little more than
half -- who are women and girls.

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:22.607
(applause)

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:25.477
Now, I'm going
to spend a little time

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:29.481
on this just for a second.

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.084
Every country and every
culture has traditions that

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:38.556
are unique and help make
that country what it is.

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:42.994
But just because something
is a part of your past

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:45.397
doesn't make it right.

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:51.302
It doesn't mean that
it defines your future.

00:27:51.302 --> 00:27:53.304
Look at us in the
United States.

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.306
Recently, we've been
having a debate about

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:58.309
the Confederate flag.

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:00.311
Some of you may be
familiar with this.

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:04.983
This was a symbol for those
states who fought against the

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:09.154
Union to preserve slavery.

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:14.993
Now, as a historical
artifact, it's important.

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:18.229
But some have argued that it's
just a symbol of heritage that

00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:21.466
should fly in public spaces.

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:24.636
The fact is it was a flag that
flew over an army that fought

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:28.273
to maintain a system of slavery
and racial subjugation.

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:30.275
So we should
understand our history,

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:36.514
but we should also recognize
that it sends a bad message

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:42.520
to those who were liberated
from slavery and oppression.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.726
And in part because of an
unspeakable tragedy that took

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:54.899
place recently, where a young
man who was a fan of the

00:28:54.899 --> 00:29:02.140
Confederate flag and racial
superiority shot helpless

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.743
people in a church, more and
more Americans of all races

00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:09.380
are realizing now that that
flag should come down.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.249
(applause)

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:12.283
Just because
something is a tradition

00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:13.785
doesn't make it right.

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:19.924
Well, so around the world,
there is a tradition

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:27.465
of repressing women and
treating them differently,

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:30.969
and not giving them
the same opportunities,

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:34.305
and husbands
beating their wives,

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:38.176
and children not
being sent to school.

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:41.112
Those are traditions.

00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:44.883
Treating women and girls
as second-class citizens,

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:46.417
those are bad traditions.

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:47.552
They need to change.

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:50.155
(applause)

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:52.190
They're holding you back.

00:29:56.361 --> 00:30:00.498
Treating women as second-class
citizens is a bad tradition.

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:01.432
It holds you back.

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:05.870
(applause)

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:08.706
There's no excuse
for sexual assault

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:10.875
or domestic violence.

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:12.544
There's no reason that
young girls should

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:16.347
suffer genital
mutilation.

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:19.217
There's no place in
civilized society for

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:22.353
the early or forced
marriage of children.

00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:24.656
These traditions may
date back centuries;

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.925
they have no place
in the 21st century.

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:31.162
(applause)

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.669
These are issues of
right and wrong --

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.338
in any culture.

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.674
But they're also issues
of success and failure.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:48.613
Any nation that fails to educate
its girls or employ its women

00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:51.549
and allowing them to
maximize their potential

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:54.052
is doomed to fall behind
in a global economy.

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:58.323
(applause)

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:01.292
You know, we're in
a sports center.

00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:05.396
Imagine if you have a team
and you don't let half

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:07.465
of the team play.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.767
(laughter)

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:10.902
That's stupid.

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:13.938
(laughter and applause)

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:17.609
That makes no sense.

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:20.078
And the evidence shows that
communities that give their

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:23.481
daughters the same
opportunities as their sons,

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:26.150
they are more peaceful,
they are more prosperous,

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.220
they develop faster, they
are more likely to succeed.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.255
(applause)

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:32.824
That's true in America.

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:34.559
That's true here in Kenya.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:37.362
It doesn't matter.

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:39.931
And that's why one of the
most successful development

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:44.435
policies you can pursue is
giving girls and education,

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:47.305
and removing the obstacles
that stand between

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:48.306
them and their dreams.

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:51.276
And by the way, if you
educate girls -- they grow

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:54.979
up to be moms -- and they,
because they're educated,

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:57.782
are more likely to produce
educated children.

00:31:57.782 --> 00:32:02.487
(applause)

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:14.065
So Kenya will not
succeed if it treats

00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:16.534
women and girls as
second-class citizens.

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:17.602
I want to be very
clear about that.

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.103
(applause)

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:22.440
Now, this leads me to the
third pillar of progress,

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.842
and that's choosing a future
of peace and reconciliation.

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:30.381
There are real
threats out there.

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:34.686
President Kenyatta and I spent
a lot of time discussing

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:38.356
the serious threat from
al-Shabaab that Kenya faces.

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:44.095
The United States faces
similar threats of terrorism.

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:47.065
We are grateful for the
sacrifices made by Kenyans

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:49.767
on the front lines
as part of AMISOM.

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:54.138
(applause)

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:57.175
We're proud of the
efforts that we're making

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.743
to strengthen Kenya's
capabilities through

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:01.913
our new Security
Governance Initiative.

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:03.915
We're going to stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:05.917
you in this fight against
terrorism for as long

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:06.884
as it takes.

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:11.756
(applause)

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:14.158
But, as I mentioned
yesterday, it is important

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:16.427
to remember that
violent extremists

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:19.630
want us to turn
against one another.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.567
That's what terrorists
typically try to exploit.

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:29.040
They know that they
are a small minority;

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.709
they know that they
can't win conventionally.

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:36.047
So what they try to do is
target societies where they

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:38.583
can exploit divisions.

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.485
That's what
happens in Iraq.

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:44.589
That's what happens
around the world.

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:48.059
That's what happened
in Northern Ireland.

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:52.830
Terrorists who try to sow chaos,
they must be met with force

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.533
and they must also be met,
though, with a forceful

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:58.403
commitment to uphold the
rule of law, and respect

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:02.573
for human rights, and to
treat everybody who's

00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:06.978
peaceful and law-abiding
fairly and equally.

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:10.648
(applause)

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:13.618
Extremists who prey on
distrust must be defeated

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:17.021
by communities who stand
together and stand for

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:19.624
something different.

00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:22.059
And the most important
example here is,

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:25.830
is that the United States
and Kenya both have

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:30.234
Muslim minorities, but
those minorities make

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:32.603
enormous contributions
to our countries.

00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:34.105
These are our brothers,
they are our sisters.

00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:35.973
(applause)

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:38.142
And so in both
our countries,

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:44.682
we have to reject calls that
allow us to be divided.

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:47.318
This is true for
any diverse society.

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:50.421
And Kenya is rich with diversity
-- with many dozens of tribes

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:53.624
and ethnicities, and languages
and religious groups.

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:56.828
And time and again, just
as we've seen the dangers

00:34:56.828 --> 00:35:00.565
of religious or ethnic
violence, we've seen that Kenya

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:03.167
is stronger when Kenyans
stand united -- with a sense

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.703
of national identity.

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:10.541
That was the case on
December 12, 1963,

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:12.844
when cities and villages across
this country celebrated

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.312
the birth of a nation.

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:18.516
It was true in 2010, when Kenya
replaced the anarchy of ethnic

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:21.319
violence with the order
of a new constitution.

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:24.956
(applause)

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:27.625
So we can all appreciate
our own identities,

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:30.394
our bloodlines, our
beliefs, our backgrounds --

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:34.031
that tapestry is what
makes us who we are.

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:37.768
But the history of Africa
-- which is both the cradle

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:41.239
of human progress and a crucible
of conflict -- shows us that

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:45.676
when define ourselves narrowly,
in opposition to somebody

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:48.012
just because they're of a
different tribe, or race,

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:51.516
or religion -- and we ignore
who is a good person or a bad

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:55.586
person, are they working hard
or not, are they honest or not,

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:59.724
are they peaceful or violent
-- when we start making

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:02.827
distinctions solely based on
status and not what people

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:06.864
do, then we're taking the
wrong path and we inevitably

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:08.633
suffer in the end.

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:11.035
(applause)

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:13.604
This is why Martin
Luther King called on people

00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:17.975
to be judged not by the color
of their skin but the content

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.610
of their character.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:23.147
(applause)

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:24.649
And in the same way, people
should not be judged

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:29.120
by their last name, or
their religious faith,

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.324
but by their content of their
character and how they behave.

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:34.325
Are they good citizens?

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:36.427
Are they good people?

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:40.665
In the United States, we embrace
the motto: E Pluribus Unum.

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:43.901
In Latin, that means,
out of many, one.

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:48.406
In Kenya, Harambee --
we are in this together.

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:51.142
Whatever the challenge, you
will be stronger if you face

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:55.846
it not as Christians or
Muslims, Masai, Kikuyu, Luo,

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:58.749
any other tribe
-- but as Kenyans.

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:02.320
And ultimately, that unity is
the source of strength that

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.956
will empower you to seize
this moment of promise.

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.924
That's what will help
you root out corruption.

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:08.059
(applause)

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.660
That's what will strengthen
democratic institutions.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.164
That's what will help
you combat inequality.

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:17.268
That's what will help you extend
opportunity, and educate youth,

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:23.441
and face down threats, and
embrace reconciliation.

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:25.776
So I want to say
particularly to the young

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:28.312
people here today,
Kenya is on the move.

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:29.914
Africa is on the move.

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:34.752
You are poised to play a
bigger role in this world --

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:35.853
(applause)

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:38.856
-- as the shadows of the past
are replaced by the light

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:44.795
that you offer an increasingly
interconnected world.

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:46.664
And in the light
of this new day,

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:50.601
we have to learn to see
ourselves in one another.

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:52.637
We have to see that
we are connected,

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:55.773
our fates are
bound together.

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:59.076
Because, in the end, we're
all part of one tribe --

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:00.478
the human tribe.

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.013
(applause)

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.782
And no matter who we are,
or where we come from,

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.851
or what we look like,
or who we love, or what

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:12.990
God we worship,
we're connected.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.694
Our fates are bound
up with one another.

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:19.497
Kenya holds within it
all that diversity.

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:22.600
And with diversity,
sometimes comes difficulty.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.970
But I look to Kenya's
future filled with hope.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.773
And I'm hopeful because of
you, the people of Kenya,

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:31.509
especially the young people.

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:34.945
There are some amazing examples
of what's going on right now

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:36.380
with young people.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:42.520
I'm hopeful because of a young
man named Richard Ruto Todosia.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.457
Richard helped build Yes Youth
Can -- I like the phrase,

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.525
Yes Youth Can --

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:51.929
(applause)

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:55.433
It became one of
the most prominent

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:57.435
civil society
organizations in Kenya,

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:58.769
with over one
million members.

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:02.940
And after the violence
of 2007, 2008,

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.943
Yes Youth Can stood
up to incitement,

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.945
helped bring opportunity
to young people

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:11.082
in places that were
scarred by conflict.

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:13.951
That's the kind of young
leadership that we need.

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.019
(applause)

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:17.655
I'm hopeful because
of a young woman

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:20.191
named Josephine Kulea.

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:23.060
(applause)

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.964
So Josephine founded
Samburu Girls Foundation.

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:29.633
And she's already helped
to rescue over 1,000

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.736
girls from abuse
and forced marriage,

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:33.037
and helped place
them in schools.

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:37.208
(applause)

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:40.111
A member of the
Samburu tribe herself,

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:42.947
she's personally planned
rescue missions to help girls

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:46.016
as young as 6 years old.

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:49.620
And she explains that, "The
longer a girl is in school,

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.258
everything for her -- for
her income, for her family,

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:56.293
for this country --
everything changes."

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:59.230
She gives me hope.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:04.101
I'm hopeful because of a young
woman named Jamila Abass.

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:07.938
So Jamila founded Mfarm, which
is a mobile platform that is

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:10.508
already used by over 14,000
people across Kenya.

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:14.612
Mfarm makes it easy for farmers
to get information that lets

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:17.748
them match their crops with
what the market demands.

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:22.119
And studies show that it can
help farmers double their sales.

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:25.022
So here's what Jamila
said: " love Kenya because

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:27.758
you feel you are home
anywhere you go."

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:32.963
Home anywhere you go --
that's the Kenya that

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:37.168
welcomed me nearly 30
years ago as a young man.

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:39.336
You helped make
me feel at home.

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:42.072
And standing here today as
President of the United States,

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:44.074
when I think about those
young people and all

00:40:44.074 --> 00:40:47.378
the young people in attendance
here, you still make

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.946
me feel at home.

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:49.847
(applause)

00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:51.916
And I'm confident that
your future is going to be

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:55.886
written across this country and
across this continent by young

00:40:55.886 --> 00:41:00.191
people like you -- young men
and women who don't have

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:03.060
to struggle under a colonial
power; who don't have

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.864
to look overseas to
realize your dreams.

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:09.900
Yes, you can realize your
dreams right here, right now.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.637
(applause)

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.640
"We have not inherited
this land from our

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.244
forebears, we have borrowed
it from our children."

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:24.181
So now is the time for us to
do the hard work of living

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:27.418
up to that inheritance;
of building a Kenya where

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:29.920
the inherent dignity of
every person is respected

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.723
and protected, and
there's no limit to what

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.291
a child can achieve.

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:37.194
I am here to tell you that
the United States of America

00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:40.497
will be a partner for you
every step of the way.

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:41.599
(applause)

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.466
God bless you.

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.467
Thank you.

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:44.368
Asante sana.

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:45.069
(applause)
