00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Hamzeh Koumakli Auditor: Fatima Zahra El Hafa 

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:13.499
 I want to start first 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.249
 By mentioning the qualifications that allow me to speak on this subject. 

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:22.512
 Because frankly, you should not listen 

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:26.040
 For any elderly person, express their opinion about Coved-19. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.587
 (Laughter) 

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:31.575
 So, I have been working in the global health field for about 20 years, 

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:36.084
 My technical specialist is in health systems 

00:00:36.084 --> 00:00:40.037
 And what happens when these systems receive severe shocks. 

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:42.609
 She also worked in the global health press. 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.173
 She wrote about global health and biosecurity 

00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:49.369
 For newspapers and websites, 

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:51.675
 She published a book several years ago 

00:00:51.675 --> 00:00:55.145
 On the major global health threats facing our planet. 

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:59.345
 Aid was provided and efforts made in the area of ​​epidemiology were led 

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:03.360
 That included assessment of Ebola treatment centers 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.350
 And search for ways to transmit TB infection in health institutions 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.688
 And the application of bird flu preparedness measures. 

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:14.294
 I hold a masters degree in global health. 

00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:16.482
 I am neither a doctor nor a nurse. 

00:01:16.482 --> 00:01:20.672
 My specialty is not patient care and does not include individual care. 

00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:24.360
 Rather, my specialty is researching population groups and health systems 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.758
 That is, I study what happens when diseases are transmitted and spread greatly. 

00:01:28.468 --> 00:01:32.341
 If we classify global health resources and experts 

00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:34.862
 On a scale from 1 to 10 

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.340
 Where Class 1 is someone shouting to Facebook, 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.407
 Class 10 is the World Health Organization 

00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:46.214
 I think you will give me a grade 7 or 8. 

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:48.869
 So, remember that I am speaking to you. 

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:51.838
 I will start with the basics 

00:01:51.838 --> 00:01:53.526
 This is because I think she was forgotten and lost 

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:56.925
 Amid the media buzz around the Covid-19. 

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:01.688
 So, Cofid-19 is the Corona virus, 

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:05.544
 Corona viruses are a specific subset of viruses, 

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:08.967
 And it has a distinct viral characteristic. 

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:12.690
 Because its genetic material is RNA and not DNA, 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.979
 And this virus is covered with thorns on its surface, 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.750
 It uses these spines to invade cells. 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.347
 These thorns are corona in corona viruses. 

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.478
 Covid 19 is a new virus from the Corona family and is well known 

00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:31.485
 This is because until last December we had heard of 6 types of corona viruses. 

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.541
 And Covid-19 is the seventh. 

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:34.829
 So it is new to us, 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.448
 He just got his genetic cascade and just got his name 

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:38.970
 So it is new to us. 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.791
 If you remember SARS, which is acute respiratory distress syndrome 

00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:46.878
 Or MERS, which is the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, 

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:48.931
 These viruses are corona viruses, 

00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:52.170
 Both are called respiratory syndrome 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.042
 This is because this is what corona viruses do. 

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:56.807
 It affects the lungs. 

00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:57.833
 It does not make you throw up, 

00:02:57.833 --> 00:02:59.878
 And it does not make you bleed from your eyes, 

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:02.643
 It does not cause any bleeding, but rather affects your lungs. 

00:03:03.793 --> 00:03:06.493
 And Covid-19 is not different from it. 

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:09.869
 It causes a variety of respiratory symptoms 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.071
 Which ranges from dry cough and fever 

00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:16.659
 And even lethal viral pneumonia. 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.966
 This great variety of symptoms is one of the reasons 

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.387
 That makes this outbreak so difficult. 

00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:26.443
 A lot of people have covid-19, 

00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:29.815
 But to a nice degree, their symptoms are mild 

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:32.585
 So much so that they do not even visit health care delivery centers. 

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:34.439
 They are not registered in health systems. 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.246
 Children especially adapt easily to Covid-19, 

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.593
 This is what we must be grateful for. 

00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:45.307
 Corona viruses are animal in source, 

00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:48.579
 That is, it is transmitted from animals to humans. 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.468
 Some other viruses, such as Covid-19, also spread from person to person. 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.360
 These viruses that pass from one person to another spread quickly and for a longer period, 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.447
 Just like Covid-19. 

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:02.802
 It is really difficult to get rid of animal diseases 

00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:05.490
 This is because they have animal reservoirs. 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.612
 One example is the bird flu virus, 

00:04:08.612 --> 00:04:11.901
 Where we can eradicate them on farm animals, 

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:13.718
 And turkeys and ducks, 

00:04:13.718 --> 00:04:17.934
 But they come back every year because wild birds carry them and bring them to us. 

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:19.313
 We do not hear much about it 

00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:22.151
 Because bird flu does not spread from one person to another, 

00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:26.854
 But we suffer from outbreaks in poultry farms every year all over the world. 

00:04:27.874 --> 00:04:32.050
 Covid-19 may have moved from animals to humans 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.987
 At a wild animal market in Wuhan, China. 

00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:38.714
 I will now turn to the less basic parts. 

00:04:39.294 --> 00:04:43.468
 This outbreak is not the last of the major outbreaks that we will see. 

00:04:43.468 --> 00:04:47.692
 There will be other outbreaks, and there will be other outbreaks. 

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:50.898
 This is not just a possibility, it is a fact. 

00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:54.234
 It is the result of the way we treat humans 

00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:56.507
 And we interact with it on our planet. 

00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:59.629
 Human choices lead us to a state 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.214
 We will be exposed to other outbreaks. 

00:05:02.784 --> 00:05:05.873
 This is partly due to climate change and what the hot climate does 

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:09.528
 By making the world a suitable place for the growth of viruses and germs. 

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:15.715
 It also has to do with the way we eliminate the last wild areas of our planet. 

00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:19.226
 When we burn and uproot the Amazon rainforest trees 

00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:21.798
 In order to have cheap grazing lands, 

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:25.721
 And when the last parts of Africa's forests become farms, 

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:30.646
 And when wild animals are caught in China until they become extinct, 

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:33.868
 Humans have come into contact with wild animal populations 

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:36.587
 We were not in contact with her before, 

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:39.611
 These groups have new types of diseases: 

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:43.175
 Germs, viruses and other things we are not prepared to face. 

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.439
 Bats, in particular, have a knack for hosting diseases 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.691
 That can infect humans. 

00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:52.063
 But they are not the only animals that do this. 

00:05:52.063 --> 00:05:56.587
 So, as long as we make our remote areas less remote and far away, 

00:05:56.587 --> 00:05:58.664
 Outbreaks will continue to appear. 

00:06:00.404 --> 00:06:05.084
 We cannot stop outbreaks with quarantine or prevent travel. 

00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:07.095
 This is the first idea that comes to everyone's mind: 

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.861
 Let us stop human actions, let us stop this outbreak from happening. 

00:06:10.861 --> 00:06:16.419
 But the truth is that it is very difficult to apply quarantine. 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.508
 It is very difficult to restrict travel movements. 

00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:23.114
 Even countries that have made huge investments in public health, 

00:06:23.114 --> 00:06:24.834
 Such as the United States and South Korea, 

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:27.687
 You cannot apply these restrictions quickly enough 

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:30.460
 So that you can stop an outbreak immediately. 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.965
 There are logistical reasons for this and other medical reasons. 

00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:36.052
 If we look at Covid-19, 

00:06:36.052 --> 00:06:38.368
 At this very moment, there seems to be a certain period 

00:06:38.368 --> 00:06:40.944
 You are infected and do not show any symptoms 

00:06:40.944 --> 00:06:43.291
 For a period of up to 24 days. 

00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:46.185
 So people who carry the virus roam between us 

00:06:46.185 --> 00:06:47.631
 Without any symptoms. 

00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:49.397
 They were not quarantined. 

00:06:49.397 --> 00:06:51.765
 No one knows that they need quarantine. 

00:06:54.415 --> 00:06:58.645
 There is also a real cost for applying quarantine and travel bans. 

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:01.106
 Humans are social beings. 

00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:03.864
 And you resist when you try to lock them somewhere 

00:07:03.864 --> 00:07:06.118
 And when you try to separate them from each other. 

00:07:06.118 --> 00:07:09.139
 We have seen the Ebola outbreak 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.994
 That as soon as the quarantine is applied somewhere, 

00:07:11.994 --> 00:07:14.448
 People start trying to break it. 

00:07:14.448 --> 00:07:18.608
 And people if they knew of a strict stone system 

00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:20.708
 They may not go to seek health care 

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:22.805
 Because they are afraid of the medical system, 

00:07:22.805 --> 00:07:24.329
 Or they can not afford to pay for it 

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:27.402
 They do not want to be separated from their family and friends. 

00:07:27.402 --> 00:07:29.371
 Politicians and government officials, 

00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:31.606
 When they know they will be quarantined 

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:33.838
 If they talk about these outbreaks and injuries, 

00:07:33.838 --> 00:07:35.732
 They may conceal real information 

00:07:35.732 --> 00:07:38.276
 This is due to their fear of applying the stone system. 

00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:42.577
 Of course, this type of evasion and misinformation 

00:07:42.577 --> 00:07:46.397
 It in and of itself makes it very difficult to track the spread of an outbreak. 

00:07:48.437 --> 00:07:51.141
 We can improve stone regulations and travel restrictions, 

00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:52.510
 We must do this. 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.031
 However, it is not the only solution, 

00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:57.792
 It is not the best solution to deal with these cases. 

00:07:58.652 --> 00:08:03.061
 The real way to make these outbreaks less dangerous in the long run 

00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:06.016
 It is by building a global health system 

00:08:06.016 --> 00:08:11.124
 To support basic health care functions in every country in the world 

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.628
 So that all countries, even poor ones, can 

00:08:13.628 --> 00:08:18.557
 To discover and treat new infectious diseases as soon as they arise. 

00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:24.362
 China has received a lot of criticism for its response to the Covid-19. 

00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:28.852
 But really, what if Covid-19 first appeared in Chad, 

00:08:28.852 --> 00:08:32.713
 Which owns 3,5 doctors per 100,000 people? 

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:36.131
 What if it first appeared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 

00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:40.471
 Which just allowed the last Ebola patient to leave the hospital after his treatment? 

00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:43.491
 The truth is that countries like these do not have the resources 

00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:45.663
 To respond to an infectious infectious disease, 

00:08:45.663 --> 00:08:46.907
 Not to mention treating the injured 

00:08:46.907 --> 00:08:50.300
 And let alone report it quickly to help the rest of the world. 

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.114
 I led an evaluation of the Ebola treatment centers in Sierra Leone. 

00:08:57.114 --> 00:08:58.568
 The truth is that 

00:08:58.568 --> 00:09:03.125
 Local doctors in Sierra Leone exposed the danger of Ebola very quickly. 

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:06.313
 As they determined the seriousness of this virus and its ability to infection and cause hemorrhaging, 

00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:08.700
 Then they recognized him as the Ebola virus. 

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.873
 But even though they exposed him, they did not have the resources to respond. 

00:09:12.873 --> 00:09:15.782
 They did not have enough doctors or family members in the hospitals, 

00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:18.800
 They did not have enough information to know how to eradicate Ebola 

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.242
 Or how to apply the basics of controlling infection. 

00:09:22.372 --> 00:09:27.180
 Eleven doctors died in Sierra Leone with Ebola. 

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.135
 And their country had only 120 doctors when this crisis began. 

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:32.705
 In contrast, 

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:36.954
 Dallas Baylor Medical Center has more than 1,000 doctors on its staff. 

00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:40.635
 This kind of injustice is what kills humans. 

00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:43.607
 First, it kills the poor when outbreaks spread, 

00:09:43.607 --> 00:09:45.977
 Then it kills all people all over the world 

00:09:45.977 --> 00:09:48.298
 When these outbreaks spread. 

00:09:48.298 --> 00:09:50.603
 If we want to slow the spread of these outbreaks 

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:52.152
 Reduce its impact, 

00:09:52.152 --> 00:09:55.426
 We need to make every country in the world 

00:09:55.426 --> 00:09:59.417
 You have what it takes to detect and treat these new diseases, 

00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:02.196
 And report it to share this information. 

00:10:03.656 --> 00:10:07.579
 Covid-19 will place a heavy burden on health systems. 

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:10.484
 I will not talk about death rates in this conversation 

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:14.792
 Because, frankly, we cannot agree on the Covid-19 mortality rates at this time. 

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:16.795
 But we can agree on one number 

00:10:16.795 --> 00:10:20.534
 That is, approximately 20% of people with Covid-19 

00:10:20.534 --> 00:10:22.986
 They will need to stay in the hospital. 

00:10:22.986 --> 00:10:27.562
 Our health system in the United States of America can hardly afford these numbers. 

00:10:27.562 --> 00:10:29.905
 But what will happen in Mexico? 

00:10:31.085 --> 00:10:34.456
 Covid-19 has shown real weakness 

00:10:34.456 --> 00:10:37.011
 In the supply chain of our health systems. 

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:41.768
 Waste-free manufacturing systems are great when everything is fine. 

00:10:41.768 --> 00:10:45.839
 But in times of crisis, this means that we do not have sufficient reserves. 

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:50.349
 If the masks run out from a hospital or a country 

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:52.170
 Or self-protection tools, 

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.892
 There is no big warehouse full of boxes we can go to get more of them. 

00:10:55.892 --> 00:10:59.415
 Rather, we have to order more from the distributor, and wait for it to be produced, 

00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:02.970
 And then to ship it, from China in general. 

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.269
 This delay in time occurs at a time when moving forward is the most important thing. 

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:12.019
 If we were fully prepared for Covid-19, 

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:15.071
 China would have recognized this outbreak early. 

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.197
 She was to be able to provide care for the injured people 

00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:21.784
 Without the need to build other buildings. 

00:11:21.784 --> 00:11:25.137
 She would have honestly shared the information with her citizens 

00:11:25.137 --> 00:11:29.330
 So we would not have seen these ridiculous rumors spread on social media platforms in China 

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.788
 They will have shared important information with the global health authorities 

00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:35.643
 So they start reporting to the national health systems 

00:11:35.643 --> 00:11:37.858
 They are preparing for the time when the virus will spread. 

00:11:38.528 --> 00:11:40.932
 Thus, national health systems will be able at that time 

00:11:40.932 --> 00:11:43.587
 On stockpile of required preventive materials 

00:11:43.587 --> 00:11:47.492
 Health care providers are trained in treatment methods and infection control. 

00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:49.970
 We will then have systems and protocols based on scientific grounds 

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.970
 What we must do when things arise 

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.607
 The presence of injured persons on a cruise ship. 

00:11:54.607 --> 00:11:59.036
 We will then be sending correct information to humans everywhere, 

00:11:59.036 --> 00:12:03.001
 That we would not have seen shameful and shameful incidents of xenophobia, 

00:12:03.001 --> 00:12:07.513
 Asian people are being beaten on the streets of Philadelphia. 

00:12:08.093 --> 00:12:12.499
 However, we will suffer from outbreaks. 

00:12:13.469 --> 00:12:16.090
 The choices we make are how to live on this planet 

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.739
 You make it inevitable. 

00:12:18.599 --> 00:12:23.684
 As far as we have information from experts about Covid-19, it: 

00:12:23.684 --> 00:12:25.921
 Here in the United States of America and all over the world, 

00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:28.577
 This condition will get worse before getting better. 

00:12:29.077 --> 00:12:31.631
 We see cases of transmission between humans 

00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:33.568
 Without someone returning from traveling, 

00:12:33.568 --> 00:12:35.654
 It occurs automatically in society. 

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:38.042
 We see people with Covid-19 

00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:41.112
 Without knowing the source of the infection. 

00:12:41.112 --> 00:12:43.867
 These are signs of worse fascism, 

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:46.365
 Not an outbreak. 

00:12:48.825 --> 00:12:52.330
 It is depressing but not surprising. 

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:57.039
 And when global health experts talk about scenarios for new viruses, 

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:59.593
 This is one of the scenarios they expected. 

00:12:59.593 --> 00:13:02.114
 We wished things would go well. 

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:05.519
 But when experts talked about the virus system, 

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:09.665
 This is the situation they expected to happen and the way they expected the virus to take. 

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:14.305
 I want to end my conversation with some personal advice. 

00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:16.460
 Wash your hands! 

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.391
 Wash your hands often! 

00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:22.746
 I know that you wash your hands a lot before now, because you are not disgusted. 

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:25.067
 But wash your hands more. 

00:13:25.067 --> 00:13:29.023
 Plan and program your lives so that you wash your hands more. 

00:13:29.023 --> 00:13:32.013
 Wash your hands every time you enter or leave a building. 

00:13:32.013 --> 00:13:35.451
 Wash your hands when you enter or leave a meeting. 

00:13:35.451 --> 00:13:38.372
 Follow a hand-washing ritual. 

00:13:38.722 --> 00:13:40.693
 Purify your cell phones. 

00:13:40.693 --> 00:13:44.365
 You touch this phone with dirty hands all the time. 

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.568
 I know you are bringing it with you to the bathroom. 

00:13:46.568 --> 00:13:48.407
 (Laughter) 

00:13:49.977 --> 00:13:51.810
 So cleanse your mobile phone. 

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.965
 And try not to use it too much in public places. 

00:13:54.965 --> 00:13:58.333
 Maybe you should only use Instagram and Talk Tok at home? 

00:13:59.123 --> 00:14:00.690
 Do not touch your face. 

00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:03.145
 Do not rub your eyes. 

00:14:03.145 --> 00:14:04.699
 Do not bite your nails. 

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:06.849
 Do not wipe your nose with the back of your hand. 

00:14:06.849 --> 00:14:09.087
 I mean, don't do that at all because it's disgusting. 

00:14:09.087 --> 00:14:10.692
 (Laughter) 

00:14:10.692 --> 00:14:12.645
 Do not wear masks on your faces. 

00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:16.100
 Face masks are for patients and health care providers. 

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.073
 If you are ill, your face mask will carry products of your coughs and sneezes 

00:14:20.073 --> 00:14:22.243
 It protects the people around you. 

00:14:22.243 --> 00:14:24.017
 And if you are a healthcare provider, 

00:14:24.017 --> 00:14:25.741
 Your muzzle is one 

00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:28.537
 From the Personal Protective Kit, 

00:14:28.537 --> 00:14:31.339
 That she is trained to use to provide care for patients 

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:33.111
 And you do not get sick. 

00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:36.049
 If you are a normal, healthy person, wear a muzzle 

00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:38.577
 It will only make your face sweat a lot. 

00:14:38.577 --> 00:14:39.812
 (Laughter) 

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.959
 Leave the gags in the stores 

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:44.866
 For use by doctors, nurses, and patients. 

00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:48.403
 If you think you have symptoms of Covid-19, 

00:14:48.403 --> 00:14:50.915
 Stay home and call your doctor for advice. 

00:14:51.675 --> 00:14:54.028
 If diagnosed with Covid-19, 

00:14:54.028 --> 00:14:56.684
 Remember, this disease is generally very mild. 

00:14:57.134 --> 00:14:58.820
 And if you are a smoker, 

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.736
 This is the time to quit smoking. 

00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:03.554
 I mean if you are a smoker, 

00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:06.983
 The opportunity is always appropriate to quit smoking. 

00:15:06.983 --> 00:15:10.005
 But if you are a smoker who is worried about getting Covid-19, 

00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:13.811
 I guarantee that quitting smoking is the best thing you can do 

00:15:13.811 --> 00:15:17.689
 To protect yourself from the most dangerous effects of Covid-19. 

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.941
 Covid-19 is scary 

00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:26.312
 At a time when all the news was frightening. 

00:15:26.682 --> 00:15:31.741
 There are many bad and attractive options we can make: 

00:15:31.741 --> 00:15:37.033
 Such as panic, xenophobia, agoraphobia, tyranny, 

00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:40.013
 And simple lies make us believe 

00:15:40.013 --> 00:15:44.060
 Hate, anger and isolation are the solution against outbreaks. 

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.442
 But it is not. It makes us less prepared. 

00:15:47.982 --> 00:15:52.189
 There are a bunch of boring but useful solutions 

00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:54.894
 That we can apply in response to outbreaks, 

00:15:54.894 --> 00:15:58.300
 Like developing healthcare provided here and everywhere; 

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.723
 Investing in healthy infrastructures and disease surveillance 

00:16:01.723 --> 00:16:04.030
 So that we know when the next disease will happen; 

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.881
 Building health systems all over the world; 

00:16:06.881 --> 00:16:09.150
 And strengthening supply chains 

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.419
 So that we are ready in an emergency; 

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:16.496
 And education, to be able to talk about outbreaks 

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:18.182
 And calculate the risk 

00:16:18.182 --> 00:16:20.649
 Without just being blind. 

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:23.540
 We must demand justice 

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.924
 This is because in this case, as in many others 

00:16:25.924 --> 00:16:29.239
 Justice is in our personal interest. 

00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:32.990
 So, thank you very much for your kind attention today. 

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.960
 Let me be the first person to ask you: 

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.337
 Wash your hands when you leave this stage. 

00:16:37.337 --> 00:16:39.457
 (clap)
