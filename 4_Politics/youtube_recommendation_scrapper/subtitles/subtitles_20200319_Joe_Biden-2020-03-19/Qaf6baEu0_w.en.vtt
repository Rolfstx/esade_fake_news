00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.998
China has the fastest and largest
high-speed rail network in the world.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.938
The country has more than 19,000
miles of high-speed rail, the vast

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:11.118
majority of which was built
in the last decade.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:15.048
Japan's bullet trains can reach speeds
of almost 200 miles per hour.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.818
And date back to the 1960s.

00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:20.208
They've become a staple for domestic travel
and have moved more than 9

00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:23.388
billion people without a
single passenger casualty.

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:28.648
France began service of the high-speed TGV
train in 1981 and the rest of

00:00:28.648 --> 00:00:29.788
Europe quickly followed.

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:33.868
And high-speed rail is quickly expanding all
over the world in places like

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:37.228
India, Saudi Arabia, Russia
Iran and Morocco.

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:39.408
And then there's the U.S.

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:49.288
The U.S.

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:52.898
used to be one of the world's global
leaders in rail but after World War

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:54.878
II there was a massive shift.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:01:00.678
If you look at the United States prior
to 1945, we had a very extensive

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:01.978
rail system everywhere.

00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:07.028
It all was working great except a number
of companies in the auto and oil

00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:11.918
industries decided that for them to
have a prosperous future they really

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:16.768
needed to basically help phase out all the
rail and get us all into cars.

00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:22.338
The inflexible rails permanently embedded
in cobblestones were paved over

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:27.138
to provide smooth, comfortable transportation
via diesel motor coach.

00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:32.918
General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil
and a few other companies that

00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:36.708
got together and they were able to
buy up all the nation's streetcar

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:41.178
systems and then quickly start
phasing out service and literally

00:01:41.228 --> 00:01:44.158
dismantling all the systems over
about a 10-year span.

00:01:44.588 --> 00:01:49.578
In the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower
signed a bill to create the National Interstate System.

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:54.468
It allocated about $25 billion dollars
to build 41,000 miles of highways.

00:01:54.688 --> 00:01:58.068
The federal government paid for 90% of
that, the states covered the final

00:01:58.238 --> 00:02:00.168
10 and rail fell by the wayside.

00:02:00.798 --> 00:02:04.368
Can't you see that this highway means a
whole new way of life for the

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:09.380
children? And a way of life that we have
a chance to help plan and, and to build.

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.948
We dedicated a huge amount of
dollars to building automobile infrastructure

00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:17.468
in the middle of the 20th century and
we're still kind of attached to that

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:19.168
model of development.

00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:26.478
We went from a rail-served country to
a auto-dependent nation by the 1960s.

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:30.278
We've become a car culture and it's
hard to break out of that cycle.

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:34.958
Not to mention the fact that in
our political system we have very powerful

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:41.388
oil lobbies, car manufacturing lobbies,
aviation lobbies, all the entities

00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:43.468
that the high-speed rail would
have to compete with.

00:02:43.868 --> 00:02:48.038
This is the American dream
of freedom on wheels.

00:02:48.358 --> 00:02:52.908
We average some 850 cars per
thousand inhabitants in the U.S.,

00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:53.848
in China it's only 250.

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:58.378
And we've never gone back.

00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:02.438
But according to some this
country's transportation ecosystem is reaching

00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:03.448
a tipping point.

00:03:03.588 --> 00:03:07.368
When you look at what's happening
with the corridor development, again

00:03:07.368 --> 00:03:09.068
states across the U.S.

00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:13.678
who are recognizing they are running out
of space to expand their highways

00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:14.948
or interstates.

00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:19.148
There are limits at airports, there
is aviation congestion, so what are

00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:19.888
the options?

00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:24.128
A better rail system is one
and could come with significant benefits.

00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:29.188
It's largely an environmental good to
switch from air traffic and car

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:32.228
traffic to electrified
high-speed rail.

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:35.088
That's a much lower
emission way of traveling.

00:03:35.268 --> 00:03:39.128
When the high-speed rail between Madrid
and Barcelona in Spain came into

00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:42.718
operation, I mean air travel just
plummeted between those cities and

00:03:42.718 --> 00:03:45.208
everyone switched over to high-speed
rail which was very convenient.

00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:46.238
People were happier.

00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:49.028
They weren't forced to switch, they did
it because it was a nicer option

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:49.978
to take high-speed rail.

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:54.588
There's a sort of a rule of thumb
for trips that are under three or four

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:58.958
hours in trip length from city to city,
those usually end up with about 80

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:03.018
or 90 percent of the
travel market from aviation.

00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:07.668
Where rail exists and it's convenient
and high-speed, it's very popular.

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:12.418
America I think is waking up to this
idea that rail is a good investment

00:04:12.468 --> 00:04:14.038
for transportation infrastructure.

00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:19.178
One survey showed 63% of Americans would
use high-speed rail if it was

00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:19.968
available to them.

00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:21.958
Younger people want it even more.

00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:25.398
Right now the main passenger
rail option in the U.S.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:26.118
is Amtrak.

00:04:26.488 --> 00:04:29.878
It's operated as a for-profit company
but the federal government is its

00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:31.008
majority stakeholder.

00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:36.458
Train systems reaching top speeds of over
110 to 150 miles per hour are

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:40.018
generally considered high-speed and only one
of Amtrak's lines could be

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:41.098
considered as such.

00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:45.028
That's its Acela line in the
Northeast Corridor running between D.C.,

00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:46.078
New York and Boston.

00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:50.058
One of the challenges we face is that
the Northeast Corridor has a lot of

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:52.288
curvature, a lot of geometry.

00:04:52.638 --> 00:04:57.348
We really operate Acela Express on an
alignment that in some places was

00:04:57.348 --> 00:05:03.088
designed back in the nineteen hundreds and
so it really was never designed

00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:04.398
for high-speed rail.

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:08.758
And while the Acela line can reach up
to 150 miles per hour, it only does

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:12.518
so for 34 miles of its 457 mile span.

00:05:12.898 --> 00:05:16.828
Its average speed between New York and
Boston is about 65 miles per hour,

00:05:17.248 --> 00:05:20.968
which is in stark contrast to
China's dedicated high-speed rail system

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:24.108
which regularly travels at over
200 miles per hour.

00:05:24.498 --> 00:05:28.378
But some people are
trying to fix that.

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:31.098
In 2008 California voted
yes on high-speed rail.

00:05:31.268 --> 00:05:34.758
Now, a decade later, construction is underway
in the Central Valley of the

00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:38.238
state. And right now it is the
only truly high-speed rail system under

00:05:38.238 --> 00:05:39.688
construction in the U.S.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:45.978
Ultimately high-speed rail is a 520
mile project that links San Francisco

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.748
to Los Angeles and
Anaheim, that's phase one.

00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:52.708
And it's a project that's
being built in building blocks.

00:05:53.128 --> 00:05:57.338
So the one behind me is the
largest building block that we're starting

00:05:57.338 --> 00:05:59.318
with, this 119 mile segment.

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:02.278
This segment will run
from Bakersfield to Merced.

00:06:02.818 --> 00:06:06.488
Eventually the plan is to build a
line from San Francisco to Anaheim, just

00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:07.068
south of L.A.

00:06:07.528 --> 00:06:11.858
But as it stands the state is almost
$50 billion short of what it needs to

00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:12.568
actually do that.

00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:18.338
The current project as planned would
cost too much and, respectfully, take

00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:18.758
too long.

00:06:19.598 --> 00:06:23.018
There's been too little oversight
and not enough transparency.

00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:28.148
We do have the capacity to complete
a high-speed rail link between Merced

00:06:28.628 --> 00:06:29.388
and Bakersfield.

00:06:29.668 --> 00:06:32.918
After Gavin Newsom made that speech
President Trump threatened to pull

00:06:32.918 --> 00:06:34.408
federal funding for the project.

00:06:34.778 --> 00:06:36.628
We will continue to
seek other funding.

00:06:36.988 --> 00:06:41.978
We hope the federal government will
resume funding the, contributing new

00:06:41.978 --> 00:06:43.028
funds to the project.

00:06:43.428 --> 00:06:47.348
I think in the future, as
the federal government has funded major

00:06:47.348 --> 00:06:51.888
construction of infrastructure over time
they'll again direct money to

00:06:52.148 --> 00:06:56.068
high-speed rail because in fact it's
not just California but other states

00:06:56.068 --> 00:06:58.558
are also interested in
high-speed rail systems.

00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:02.368
To complete the entire line as planned,
the official estimate is now over

00:07:03.038 --> 00:07:06.318
$77 billion and it's unclear where
the money will come from.

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:09.028
So why is it so expensive?

00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:13.098
Part of the problem in California, the
big price tag is getting through the

00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:18.138
Tehachapi, very expensive tunneling, or over
the Pacheco Pass to get into

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:19.668
San Jose from the Central Valley.

00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:24.708
You know, Eastern China, the flatlands
of Japan where they've built the

00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:28.508
Shinkansen, all of those are settings
where they have, didn't incur the

00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:33.128
very high expense of boring and tunneling
that we face so the costs are

00:07:33.128 --> 00:07:33.538
different.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.218
And a lot of the money is
spent before construction can even begin.

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:41.118
Just in this little segment here
alone we're dealing with the private

00:07:41.118 --> 00:07:45.038
property owner, we're dealing with a
rail company, we're dealing with the

00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:48.328
state agency and so
just the whole coordination.

00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:52.088
Then we're dealing with a utility
company, just in this very small

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:57.738
section; we had to relocate two miles
of freeway and that was roughly $150

00:07:58.128 --> 00:07:59.508
million per mile.

00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:03.448
So there's a lot of moving pieces
to, you know, anywhere we start

00:08:03.448 --> 00:08:04.068
constructing.

00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:07.638
China is the place
that many folks compare.

00:08:08.408 --> 00:08:14.238
They have like 29,000 kilometers of high-speed
rail and 20 years ago they

00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:14.708
had none.

00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:18.298
So how have they been able
to do it so quickly?

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:23.518
And part of it is that the state
owns the land, they don't have private

00:08:23.568 --> 00:08:25.398
property rights like we
have in the U.S.

00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:29.688
You don't have the regulations we have
in terms of labor laws and

00:08:30.178 --> 00:08:33.258
environmental regulations that
add to cost.

00:08:33.418 --> 00:08:35.598
It also delays the projects.

00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:39.328
For some reason and I've never really
quite seen an adequate explanation as

00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:43.978
to why costs to build transit or
many big infrastructure projects are just

00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:47.648
dramatically higher than in other parts
of the world, including in other

00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:48.658
advanced countries.

00:08:48.888 --> 00:08:52.148
But the bottom line is we're really
bad at just building things cheaply

00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:54.278
and quickly in the U.S.

00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:54.758
in general.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:59.498
So it's not just rail infrastructure
that is expensive, all transportation

00:08:59.498 --> 00:09:00.448
infrastructure is.

00:09:00.718 --> 00:09:06.018
Just the physical investment in the freeway usually
will be 5 to 8 to 10

00:09:06.018 --> 00:09:11.358
million per mile but if you add
seismic issues and land acquisition and

00:09:11.438 --> 00:09:17.288
utilities and environmental mitigation and
remediation of soils and

00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:22.698
factors like that it can become as high
as 100 or 200 million a mile.

00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:29.248
The numbers for high-speed rail can vary
anywhere from 20 to 80 million

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:29.998
per mile.

00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:34.228
The big reason why America is behind
on high-speed rail is primarily money.

00:09:34.588 --> 00:09:37.698
We don't commit the dollars needed to
build these systems, it's really as

00:09:37.698 --> 00:09:38.408
simple as that.

00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:40.578
And it's largely a political issue.

00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:44.058
We don't have political leaders who
really want to dedicate the dollars

00:09:44.058 --> 00:09:44.428
needed.

00:09:44.698 --> 00:09:48.298
There's a lot of forces in America
that really don't want to see rail

00:09:48.668 --> 00:09:52.778
become our major mode of transportation
especially because it will affect

00:09:52.998 --> 00:09:57.418
passenger numbers on airplanes, it'll
affect the use of autos.

00:09:57.658 --> 00:10:01.958
So you have the politics, the
message shaping and then the straight

00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.468
advertising and all three of those
coordinate and work together to keep

00:10:05.468 --> 00:10:09.508
America kind of focused on cars
and not focused on rail.

00:10:10.008 --> 00:10:14.008
Some of the earliest support for
rail came from the Nixon administration.

00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:19.148
Some of the original capital subsidies
and operating subsidies for urban

00:10:19.148 --> 00:10:23.958
transit came from the Republican party, so
I think it's only more recently

00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:28.298
that maybe this has shifted that more
liberal leaning folks who care about

00:10:28.298 --> 00:10:33.678
climate and a whole host of urban
issues have really argued for investing

00:10:33.908 --> 00:10:34.918
very heavily in rail.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:38.788
If you had Democratic leadership on the
Senate and a different president or

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:41.788
potentially some leverage for a president to
sign a new budget bill with

00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:46.068
some dollars for high-speed rail,
that could override those objections

00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:47.328
from Republicans in Congress.

00:10:47.328 --> 00:10:48.918
But I think it's mostly ideological.

00:10:49.228 --> 00:10:50.448
They're big on highways.

00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:52.448
They're big on things
like toll roads.

00:10:52.448 --> 00:10:54.888
They just, they don't want the government
spending dollars on this kind of

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:58.688
project and they see it as
something those socialist European countries do

00:10:58.688 --> 00:11:01.988
but not something that should be
done in, you know, car-loving America.

00:11:02.498 --> 00:11:07.728
In my judgment, it would take a
very strong federal commitment, almost sort

00:11:07.728 --> 00:11:12.958
of a post-Second World War interstate
highway kind of large scale national

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:13.598
commitment.

00:11:13.938 --> 00:11:17.318
This is why some high-speed rail
projects are trying to avoid public

00:11:17.318 --> 00:11:18.318
funding altogether.

00:11:18.618 --> 00:11:22.248
One company, Texas Central, plans to build
a bullet train from Houston to

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:24.758
Dallas without using a
dime of taxpayer money.

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:31.158
We're taking what is laborious, unreliable
four-hour drive if you're lucky

00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:34.998
and turning that into a
reliable, safe 90 minutes.

00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:40.258
And when you look at that as a
business plan being driven by data, this is

00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:43.718
the right place to build the first
high-speed train in the United States.

00:11:44.018 --> 00:11:48.058
The Texas project is backed by investors
motivated to make a profit and

00:11:48.058 --> 00:11:50.508
will use proven
Japanese rail technology.

00:11:50.808 --> 00:11:54.438
Texas Central's goal is to
complete the project by 2025.

00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:58.158
Another private company is even further
along with its rail system, in

00:11:58.158 --> 00:12:02.278
Florida. It's expanding its higher-speed
train from Miami to Orlando.

00:12:02.568 --> 00:12:04.948
Orlando's the most heavily visited
City the United States.

00:12:05.238 --> 00:12:08.048
Miami is the most heavily visit
international city in the United States.

00:12:08.348 --> 00:12:11.638
It's too far to drive, it's too short
to fly, we had the rail link and

00:12:11.638 --> 00:12:13.678
that was really the
genesis of the project.

00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:17.978
Wes Edens has invested heavily in Florida's
rail project which used to be

00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:18.848
called Brightline.

00:12:19.128 --> 00:12:22.858
Brightline recently rebranded to Virgin
Trains as the company partnered

00:12:22.858 --> 00:12:24.648
with Richard Branson's Virgin Group.

00:12:24.888 --> 00:12:30.198
The team at Brightline, which is now
called Virgin Trains, has proven that

00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:31.048
it can work.

00:12:31.048 --> 00:12:36.258
The people actually want to get out of
their cars and they'd love to be on trains.

00:12:36.478 --> 00:12:40.588
In order to reach profitability, the
company sacrificed speed to save money.

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:44.158
If you want to really go
high-speed you have to grade separate.

00:12:44.158 --> 00:12:48.058
So you basically have to build a bridge
for 250 miles that you then put a

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:48.618
train on.

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:51.658
That sounds hard, and it sounds expensive
and it's both of those things.

00:12:51.658 --> 00:12:55.498
So a huge difference in cost, a huge
difference in time to build and not

00:12:55.498 --> 00:12:56.908
that much of a reduction in service.

00:12:57.138 --> 00:13:00.578
And now tech companies are
getting involved with infrastructure projects.

00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:03.948
In the Pacific Northwest a high-speed
rail plan is underway to connect

00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:05.778
Portland, Seattle and Vancouver.

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:09.788
Microsoft contributed $300,000 towards
research for the project.

00:13:10.118 --> 00:13:13.298
Our number one priority from Microsoft as
well it to really see and pursue

00:13:13.298 --> 00:13:15.278
this high-speed rail effort happen.

00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:19.588
If you look around the United States
and where all of the Fortune 500

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:23.508
companies are located they all are
in a similar situation to Microsoft.

00:13:23.588 --> 00:13:26.588
The housing is unaffordable,
traffic congestion is epic.

00:13:26.998 --> 00:13:29.718
It's too hard to get
anywhere and to get employees.

00:13:29.818 --> 00:13:34.708
So high-speed rail can solve this
same exact problem in numerous regions

00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:35.818
around the United States.

00:13:36.228 --> 00:13:39.758
So is the private sector the answer
to bringing high-speed rail to the

00:13:39.758 --> 00:13:40.308
U.S.?

00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:44.218
If the private sector wants to invest
in transportation and as long as it's

00:13:45.108 --> 00:13:49.658
not impinging on the public taxpayers I
don't see a problem with private

00:13:49.658 --> 00:13:50.728
sector moving forward.

00:13:51.178 --> 00:13:54.238
And I think there is some truth that
the private sector is gonna have much

00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:56.878
more of an incentive to hurry up
on the construction and get things done

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:58.118
more quickly, more cheaply.

00:13:58.408 --> 00:14:02.178
That said, the private sector still has
to operate with the oversight and

00:14:02.178 --> 00:14:04.478
regulatory responsibilities of
the public sector.

00:14:04.768 --> 00:14:07.868
So for example environmental review doesn't
go away just because it's a

00:14:07.908 --> 00:14:08.918
private sector project.

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:11.288
Labor standards don't go away.

00:14:11.658 --> 00:14:14.608
The difference is that they don't have to
keep trying to sell a project to

00:14:14.608 --> 00:14:18.278
the public for a vote to
raise taxes or sell bonds.

00:14:18.508 --> 00:14:20.508
Some people remain optimistic
that the U.S.

00:14:20.508 --> 00:14:24.548
can catch up to the rest of the
world and have a robust, high-speed rail system.

00:14:24.798 --> 00:14:26.798
We're building that right
now behind us.

00:14:27.258 --> 00:14:31.278
This 119 mile segment that we want
to expand with the money we already

00:14:31.278 --> 00:14:36.238
have to 170 miles, it's going to serve
a population of 3 million people in

00:14:36.238 --> 00:14:37.098
the Central Valley.

00:14:37.528 --> 00:14:40.638
So it's, not only do I
believe, but it's under construction.

00:14:41.038 --> 00:14:45.038
A lot of activity is now taking
shape, state rail authorities have been

00:14:45.038 --> 00:14:49.638
shaped in four or five states, so
they're actually taking these on now as

00:14:49.908 --> 00:14:51.928
a legitimate project
and moving forward.

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:56.328
I think the future is very bright
for train travel in the United States.

00:14:56.328 --> 00:15:02.388
There's broad consensus with our policy
leaders in industry that it's time

00:15:02.388 --> 00:15:07.048
to move an infrastructure bill and
that will certainly help kickstart U.S.

00:15:07.048 --> 00:15:07.558
rail.

00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:09.398
Others are much less confident.

00:15:09.568 --> 00:15:11.338
I wish I were
a little more optimistic.

00:15:11.488 --> 00:15:17.128
It's just very difficult to
make the economics work here.

00:15:17.678 --> 00:15:21.088
No one has embraced it as a
strong part of their political platform.

00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:24.928
There's just too many other
tough pressing problems we're facing.

00:15:25.178 --> 00:15:28.098
I don't see us catching up
to where the world is.

00:15:28.098 --> 00:15:31.648
It would take such a massive infusion
of dollars for that to happen in

00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:36.728
California and probably waving a
number of environmental requirements and

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:40.558
some other government regulations that
hinder the quick deployment of

00:15:40.558 --> 00:15:43.068
these projects in favor
of other values.

00:15:43.288 --> 00:15:46.938
My own instincts are that it's going
to be decades and decades of decades

00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:52.348
before you'll be able to go a
one-seat trip from San Diego to Sacramento

00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:53.898
or San Francisco.

00:15:53.978 --> 00:15:58.318
It'd be nice if there was just
one simple answer, it's this litany of

00:15:58.838 --> 00:16:02.552
factors that collectively add up that make this
so hard to pull

00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:04.199
off in the United States.
