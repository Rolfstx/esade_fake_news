00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.840
 This is Whitley County. Like many counties in neighboring areas 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.220
 The vast majority of voters supported Donald Trump in the November elections. 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:18.340
 The county's median per capita income is about $ 16,000. 97% of residents are white, 88% of residents over 25 years of age do not have a college degree 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.760
 It also happens to be the birthplace of KFC fried chicken 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.600
 However, the residents here are also among the Americans who benefit most from the medical policy signed by President Obama— 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.660
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (The Affordable Care Act, ACA, Obamacare) 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.800
 Kathy: "I am now with Vox, VOX.news.com or something 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.680
 Their reporters will follow me 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.379
 About the impact of medical insurance on us residents of southeastern Kentucky " 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.500
 She is Kathy. Her job is to participate as an advisor to Obamacare, helping people participate in the insurance 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 Since the bill was implemented in 2013 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 The population with medical insurance in this county rose from 75% to 90% 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.540
 Kathy helped many of them to participate in medical insurance 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.900
 "I can't count how many people ... maybe more than a thousand people" 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.140
 But what happened next is hard to understand. Reporter: "Who did you vote for?", Kathy: "Trump" 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 Trump: "The real change is about to begin, this is to immediately abolish and replace Obamacare!" (Cheers) 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:32.460
 Since the launch of Obamacare in 2013, the number of low-income, less-educated white Americans who have purchased Medicare has increased substantially 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.080
 And it ’s not just Kentucky, it ’s the same nationwide. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.220
 This group especially benefits from this bill compared to other groups. 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.420
 However, this group also supported Trump in a large proportion in the November elections 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.120
 I went to Kentucky to talk to Kathy 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.880
 I want to understand why so many people will vote for a candidate who vows to abolish the medical insurance plan they depend on 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.770
 Vox will host a visit with President Obama, and we will invite Kathy to attend 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.340
 Go to share her views and ask the president. 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.500
 Kathy: "They invited me to the White House, my goodness, my goodness, my goodness, my goodness! Yes, it is to the White House 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.660
 You must go to Facebook to see it, otherwise you will miss a lot of things " 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.660
 Before heading to Washington, DC, we first wandered southeast Kentucky to visit some Trump supporters who participated in the Obamacare plan 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.780
 We would like to hear their opinions on the current health insurance bill 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.120
 And what they think the next government will do to improve Obamacare 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.940
 "Everyone needs insurance, no matter what their cultural background ... We never know what will happen 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.520
 But you must also be able to afford insurance insurance. " 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.939
 We got several explanations for this "Trump-Obama Paradox" 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.989
 The first is that the people of Kentucky believe that Trump and the Republican Party will not really abolish 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.680
 A plan to benefit more than 20 million people 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 Reporter: "So don't you think they (Republicans) will really do this?" 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.660
 Kathy: "No, they can't (do this). That's like he has children, and he will be smarter than that (note: I don't know what Kathy is talking about). Do you know what I'm talking about?" 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.540
 Many people think that Trump's campaign against Obama's health insurance is just empty talk 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.760
 Actually he has no way to abolish a plan that so many people depend on 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.160
 This is not just the thoughts of Trump ’s voters. 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.000
 Vox Senior Reporter: "I am a reporter and have reported on the medical insurance bill for about 7 years 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.700
 Until a few months ago, there was still a reassuring assumption 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.580
 That is, the medical insurance now launched covers 20 million people, and it will continue to exist. 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.140
 I remember I wrote a report for Vox in 2015, the title is probably like this 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.840
 "Obama Medicare has passed the last obstacle and will survive" 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.280
 Republicans are still so committed to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act after the election. 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.860
 A year ago, I never expected this to happen, I thought their attitude would soften 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.400
 But I was wrong " 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.380
 Many participants in the Obamacare in Kentucky, as well as policy experts and reporters, assume 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.200
 Obamacare is already very common and cannot be abolished. 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.219
 But Republican congressmen are proving that they are wrong and are actively using various methods to abolish it 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:03.819
 News report: "Mr. Ryan said that the first task of the new Congress is to abolish Obamacare" 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.160
 But perhaps it is more powerful to explain why the beneficiaries of Obamacare will vote for Trump 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.859
 It ’s because people are not satisfied with the cost of the plan 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.680
 And believe that Trump will somehow improve health insurance 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.220
 We met with a security guard Perry, who recently participated in Obamacare 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.200
 This is the first time in his life that he has medical insurance 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.400
 Perry: "I have never seen a doctor ... the last time I went to see a doctor, you were not even born" 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.360
 "Really?" "Really" 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.180
 Thanks to Kathy ’s help, Perry was able to register with healthcare.gov a few months ago 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.480
 His deductible (that is, the policyholder ’s loss will exceed this amount before the policy will be compensated, commonly known as the "bottom fee") is $ 2,000 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.540
 Perry: "Unless serious things happen, how many times do I have to see a doctor before I can use up that 2,000 yuan?" 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.920
 I just hope that if we are to accept the plan, it must be something we can afford 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.250
 We then went to an antique shop 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.920
 Bobby, the boss there, another participant in Obamacare 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.540
 Bobby: "Last year I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I am very happy that I have insurance 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:15.680
 But I did n’t realize that the government was subsidizing my medical insurance 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.860
 I confirm that the same quality medical services are everyone's due 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.080
 It ’s just that I think American-style medical services are completely out of control in terms of price. ” 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.960
 One of the reasons Boddy complained about the plan was 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.480
 This plan has a relationship with the president she does n’t like very much 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:41.280
 Perry: "I absolutely hate hearing the word" Obama Medicare. "I hate the word." 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.820
 We head to the shopping mall on the border of Tennessee 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.520
 Kathy set up a booth there to help people participate in Obamacare 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.580
 We visited the store manager there, about his views and observations of colleagues and employees participating in Obamacare 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.320
 Store manager: "At first, it seemed that everyone was excited because they had the opportunity to get medical insurance, and it was medical insurance they could afford 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.000
 For some of them, this is the first time they have been covered by insurance 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.660
 In the second year, they have to face the increase in premiums and have to make changes in insurance 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:24.250
 Usually this means that they choose some insurance plans with higher deductibles in order to continue to be insured (the higher the deductible, the lower the premium) 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.040
 Although Obama Medical Insurance has granted 20 million Americans medical insurance 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.300
 But half of Obamacare registrants think the deductible is still too high 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.720
 Kathy: "I think people will be very disappointed, yes, because many of them ... their living budget is so tight" 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:51.300
 Because of disappointment with Obama ’s high premiums, participants in Obamacare have full confidence in Trump ’s ability to solve this problem 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:58.500
 Bobby: "I think he will try to solve it, first because he is a businessman, he understands money 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.700
 So I believe he will solve many problems " 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.980
 "I think he will replace it (Obama Health Insurance) ... I hope he will at least 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.820
 At least from his words, he will replace it with a better plan (Obama Health Insurance) " 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.560
 Trump did not promote a new plan that could replace Obamacare 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 On the contrary, he focused on promoting the promise of "repeal it" 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.460
 Trump: "It will be abolished and replaced, and we will know that (to replace it) will be a good and cheaper medical insurance plan" 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:33.180
 News report: "An analysis from the non-partisan Federal Fund (The Commonwealth fund) found that Trump's proposal will cause up to 25 million people to lose insurance" 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.440
 But none of the people we visited seemed to need a plan 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.800
 They are frustrated by the current (health insurance) bill and seem to be willing to risk Trump ’s promise 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.900
 Trump: "Abolish and replace it with an excellent plan" 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.220
 Kathy and other residents of the county accepted the gambling 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.600
 After a snowstorm, we flew to DC (Washington) to meet the president 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.480
 Obama: "Go on, Kathy" 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.380
 Kathy: "Hello, President Obama, I am very excited to meet you" 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.302
 Obama: "I am very happy to see you" 

00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:02.120
 Kathy: "Thank you 

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.260
 Many residents of Kentucky are treating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obama Health Insurance) as unaffordable and unusable 

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.980
 Why do you think this problem occurs? How should we improve? 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.740
 Will we start over? What do you think we should do? " 

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:32.840
 Obama: "This is also my main dissatisfaction with Obamacare, that is, the subsidy may not reach the level it should be for many citizens. 

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:41.040
 So we have two things that can really make health care work better for the people of Kentucky 

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:52.620
 First, provide more subsidies for citizens who work hard every day but think that even if there is a subsidy, the premiums are still unaffordable 

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.410
 … The problem is that this (Obama ’s own solution) is different from the plan being proposed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky 

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.570
 Obama spent almost 8 minutes answering Kathy ’s question 

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.800
 You should watch the full interview and listen carefully to Obama ’s rebuttal 

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:11.660
 The focus of Obama ’s response is that although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is not perfect, we can use the current system to improve it 

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.120
 But Republican MPs and Trump did not propose ways to improve the current method 

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.560
 They just proposed to abolish it 

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.520
 And never stated that they have a better plan to replace it 

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:37.160
 Obama: "I now say to all Republicans: If you can really come up with a plan that is obviously better than Obamacare 

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:45.020
 I will openly support their repeal and replace Obamacare with your (Republican) plan 

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.080
 But I have to see it first (Republican plan) " 

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.240
 Many people bet on Trump without knowing what plans he has 

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:58.520
 Now that the Republicans (GOP) are controlling Congress, let ’s see if they will honor their promises and propose a better plan than Obamacare 

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.760
 Kathy: "I think we need to make changes, and that's why I just joke 

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:09.720
 It ’s like playing Russian roulette or ... (Note: I ca n’t translate this sentence) ... Say: Hey, I ’m going to vote ”
