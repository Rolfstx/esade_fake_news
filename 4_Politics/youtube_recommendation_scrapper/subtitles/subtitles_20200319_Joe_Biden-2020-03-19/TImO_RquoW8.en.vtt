00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Presidents give hundreds of speeches.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.140
But, for better or worse, we tend to remember a few one-liners.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.260
There you go again.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.400
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.500
Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.640
You know if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.480
For President George H.W. Bush it's:

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.220
Read my lips. No new taxes.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.880
And the thing about that line is 
it's about so much more than taxes.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.080
It's about the battle for the soul of the Republican Party.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.000
A battle that Bush lost.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.280
And a battle whose repercussions we're still living with.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.040
Tonight accepting the nomination for president of the United
States -

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.560
portraying himself during the course of his speech as the guy next door.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.620
With your values of hard work, family,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.740
sensitive about greed,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.080
sensitive about the homeless,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.020
sensitive about the need to do better
for women economically,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.000
but tough-on-crime, for guns,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.700
against taxes, for the environment.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.240
He was presiding over a split party.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.060
George Bush represented one wing of the party,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.400
which was this sort of northeast,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.600
patrician, some call it country club
Republican party.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.480
These Republicans were wealthy,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.620
educated at prestigious universities,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.520
and often fairly moderate when it came to economic issues like budgets and taxes -

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.040
and on social issues like abortion and gay rights.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.800
That had certain characteristics that were

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.060
very different from the Reagan wing.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.940
Spurred by the anti-war movement,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.620
the legalization of abortion,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.040
and the civil rights movement,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.220
groups with more conservative beliefs 
on race, gender, and culture

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.100
rallied behind Reagan.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.400
All of these come together in a new coalition

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.180
called the Reagan coalition.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560
George Bush isn't the one who pulled them together.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.840
George Bush was considered a counterfeit conservative

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900
by many Reaganites.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.900
They didn't trust him quite frankly.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.320
Bush tried to seem less elite, less country
club.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.560
He used to talk about how much he liked eating pork rinds.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.380
He needed to push a little bit to be culturally acceptable.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.380
It wasn't just the cultural stuff.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.120
Bush's type of economic conservatism differed from his predecessor as well.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.680
While Bush focused on pragmatism -

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.496
balancing budgets without increases to spending.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.300
Reagan had a different plan.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.640
It was called supply-side economics.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.020
That you could slash the amount of money

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.440
that the federal government got in tax revenue,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.080
while at the same time spending more money on the military.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.100
This appealed to a larger base of middle-class voters

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.100
and small and big business owners,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.140
and it was a great idea in theory.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.900
Well it didn't - it just didn't work out that way.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.540
Indeed the United States started getting these huge budget deficits.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.600
What was George was supposed to do?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.400
He never believed in Ronald Reagan's approach to economics.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.460
Voodoo economic policy!

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.760
It just isn't going to work.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.320
Reagan's trickle-down economics meant Bush inherited

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.540
a massive budget deficit from Reagan.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.920
Which is why, even though he said,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920
"Read my lips no new taxes."

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.160
He had no other alternatives.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.820
The handwriting is on the wall for George H.W. Bush

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.880
as president the United States.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.100
He realizes that he is not going to be able to keep

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.720
that 'No new taxes' pledge.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.080
I did it because I thought it was right. 
And I made a mistake.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.660
He recognized he had to put country over
party.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.100
Democrats controlled the House and Senate,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.260
so Bush teamed up with them to pass a bill

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.820
to fix the deficit by raising the top tax rate on the wealthy.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.620
He had very little support on his own side of the political aisle.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.540
His willingness to create a "gentler, kinder nation"

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.160
did not sit well with right-wing Republicans.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.600
Bush's presidency was characterized by his ability

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.180
to build bridges and make bipartisan deals.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.060
Passing the landmark 
1990 Americans with Disabilities Act.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.660
Let the shameful wall of exclusion 
finally come tumbling down.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.960
Which the New York Times called the most sweeping

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.400
anti-discrimination bill since
the Civil Rights Act.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.840
After the Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.620
He built another bipartisan coalition to strengthen the Clean Air Act

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.040
and he signed into law an immigration bill that

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.200
kept families together, and let more
people into the country.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.080
Immigration is not just a link to America's past,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.440
It's also a bridge to America's future.

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.220
Abroad he earned the trust of Soviet
premier Mikhail Gorbachev,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.720
and got him to accept a unified Germany.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.930
Over a million people here, celebrating a day that they

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.900
never thought would come. The day in
which Germany became one country again.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.600
He was a man who understood diplomacy.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.680
He understood that in order to connect with people,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.860
who represent other countries, you have to put yourself in their shoes.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.540
But his successes abroad didn't quell cultural and economic discontent stateside.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.900
From NBC News: Decision '92 Election Night

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.220
These politicians who put themselves out

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.780
work so hard and then are crushed effectively.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.780
The people have spoken and we respect

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.120
the majesty of the democratic system.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.940
The new president of the United States,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.180
his wife Hillary and their daughter Chelsea.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.300
Bush's loss led Reaganites to
abandon

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.620
a moderate bipartisan approach to politics,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.560
and the Republican Party has
moved further to the right ever since.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.560
They see '92, they see the collapse of the
Bush presidency,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.660
and they know that this is the time for them to make their move.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.340
You see that the House going more and more to the right.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.580
Political scientists actually measure this.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.820
They take individual members of Congress,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.260
look at all of the bills that they vote yes and no for,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.060
and assign them a score based on
those votes.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.720
They get one score for their votes on economic stuff

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.500
and another for their votes on social issues.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.000
Do this for every member,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.800
and you get a kind of ideological map of Congress.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.420
And that map has been changing since before

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.720
Bush lost the presidency.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.040
If you look at the average ideology scores for both parties over time,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.120
Republicans in the House have been getting more conservative

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.100
more quickly than their Democratic peers have shifted left.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.520
It's true for presidents too.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.820
From Eisenhower to George W. Bush,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.100
the ideology scores for Republicans get
increasingly conservative

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.180
while Democrats scores stay roughly consistent over time.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.960
I think George H.W. Bush becomes an inflection point

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.640
for not only the presidency,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.100
the generational movements,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.660
the last World War II, Greatest Generation president

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.450
but also they may be the last Republicans of that country-club,

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.960
Northeast republicanism.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.140
In an interview with journalist Mark Updegrove,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.740
Bush confirmed that he voted for Hillary
Clinton in 2016.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.760
His party had become so unrecognizable in his lifetime,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.380
the former president voted for the wife of the man

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.160
who had beat him 24 years earlier.
