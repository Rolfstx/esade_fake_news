00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.769
TIM MCLEAN: Morning folks, it's um Thursday
the 6th of February. Middle of a ghost town

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.539
here. Everyone is hiding. It's dire here.
It's very dire. There's people dropping on

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.360
the footpath, literally. Ok? I can't wait
to get out of here, it's terrible.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.869
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: A city of 11 million
people in lockdown.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.940
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
So here I am, sitting at home and reporting

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.410
from where I live. That's because after returning
from Hubei province at the heart of the coronavirus

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.940
outbreak, everybody's told you need to go
into quarantine, you can't be exposed to others

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.190
for several weeks...

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.609
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: More than two-thousand
dead, tens of thousands infected. Rising anger

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.739
over how the crisis is being handled.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.600
RICHARD MCGREGOR, EAST ASIA SENIOR FELLOW,
LOWY INSTITUTE: Local officials in Wuhan did

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.410
withhold information. The doctors in Wuhan
who were talking about it were explicitly

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.280
told to shut up.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.580
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: And scientists racing
to find a vaccine.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.840
PROFESSOR TREVOR DREW, DIRECTOR, CSIRO AUSTRALIAN
ANIMAL HEALTH LABORATORY: We just don't know

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.060
how this outbreak is going to develop or how
many people are ultimately going to be infected,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.780
or ultimately going to die from this disease.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.160
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Tonight on 4 Corners,
how the coronavirus outbreak sparked a global

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.000
emergency.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.040
TIM MCLEAN: I'm absolutely fucking petrified.
The police are actually knocking on doors

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.800
and taking temperatures and if people have
a temperature, they're dragging them out.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.880
You don't get a fucking say in it. You don't
get an option.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.520
YING WANG: Wuhan is a very, very beautiful
charming and bustling city in central China.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:19.680
It sits on the banks of the Yangtze River.
It's a mega city. Wuhan is also home to the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.980
second most number of universities in China.
People around the world come to Wuhan to study.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.520
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT
It's right in the heart of the country, geographically

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.720
as well as economically. Because all these
trains and plains are coming through there.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.439
To have the outbreak start there, it's almost
like if you wanted to pick the worst place

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.920
for it to break out in, that would be the
place you'd release it.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.920
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: In early December,
people in Wuhan begin falling ill with a  mystery virus.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.819
PROFESSOR SHARON LEWIN, DIRECTOR, DOHERTY
INSTITUTE: The first infections in Wuhan started

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.220
in early December, and I believe the first
case in December the 1st. When a new infectious

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:30.549
disease appears, it does take a little time
to register and become aware that it's new.

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.620
Um, so there were people presenting with a
form of pneumonia.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.360
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Local doctors suspect
the virus originated in the city's seafood

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.460
and wildlife market.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.520
PROFESSOR RAINA MACINTYRE, HEAD, BIOSECURITY
PROGRAM, UNSW KIRBY INSTITUTE: So, we think

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.840
the virus probably originated from bats, because
that's what the genetic data tell us, but

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.450
often there's an intermediary animal host.
In this case they think pangolins might be

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.239
implicated, which are a mammal, and that intermediary
animal host might have been at the markets.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.349
We don't think that it's from eating those
things specifically, like through the gastrointestinal

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.930
tract, but more from handling them, from touching
the contaminated meat. So, somewhere in that

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.920
market we believe there must have been a contaminated animal source that infected

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.200
the first cluster of humans.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.720
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: In late December
as the number of cases increases, doctors

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.400
in Wuhan begin sharing information in a private
chat group.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.100
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
Well before any of us knew about the coronavirus,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.280
there were people who tried to sound the alarm.
So, there were a group of whistle blowers

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:50.600
who'd heard that there was this virus cluster,
and they started speaking about it. Now, in

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.400
particular, there was one doctor, Li Wenliang.
He posted on a chat group with his former

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.570
university classmates, that people had been
coming into his university with what he thought

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.780
was the SARS virus.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.860
VOICEOVER (starts in Chinese, then in English):
7 SARS cases were confirmed in the Huanan

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.620
seafood market. The main mode of transmission
of the virus is droplet transmission at close

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.950
range or contact with respiratory secretions
of patients. This can cause a special pneumonia

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.750
that is evidently contagious and capable of
affecting multiple organ systems. It is also

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.540
called SARS. The patients were isolated in
the emergency department of our hospital.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.880
Everyone please be careful.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.580
VOICEOVER: That's scary. SARS is back?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.200
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: The outbreak revived
the spectre of SARS, another type of coronavirus

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.280
which killed 774 people in 2002 and 2003.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.260
PROFESSOR SHARON LEWIN, DIRECTOR, DOHERTY
INSTITUTE: The reason why they would have

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.970
been so concerned at the prospect is this
was SARS, was threefold. First of all, SARS

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.840
was super infectious. Second, it had a relatively
high mortality rate of 10%. And third, a large

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.470
number of healthcare workers actually died
from SARS because of the complexity with stopping

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.740
transmission and I think that was the real
concern.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.980
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: On the same day as
Dr Li's warning, the Wuhan Health Commission

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.050
sends an urgent internal notice to hospitals
on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.500
VOICEOVER (starts in Chinese, then in English):
Some medical institutions in our city have

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.560
seen patients steadily with pneumonia of unknown
cause. If you find patients with unexplained

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.370
pneumonia, actively adjust the resources and
treat them on the spot.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.180
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: The notice warns
them to keep the outbreak quiet.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.020
VOICEOVER: Without authorisation, no units
or individuals shall release treatment related

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.240
information to the outside.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.000
DR WU QIANG, CHINESE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:
I have no doubt that local governments have

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.550
reported the situation to the central government.
So local governments were not accountable

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.430
to the people at that time, but to the central
government. They adopted a policy of concealing

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.460
the truth from the public but starting to
control the epidemic internally. This contradiction

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.450
prevented them from properly mobilizing to
deal with the spread of the epidemic.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.180
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Dr Li and the other
doctors continue to share information.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.890
VOICEOVER: Be careful. The WeChat group of
our class has been banned. The latest news

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:33.720
is the coronavirus infection has been confirmed,
and virus classification is in progress. Please

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.150
don't spread the word and ask your family
and loved ones to take precautions.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.980
VOICEOVER: Do not go to the Huanan seafood
market in the near future.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.040
RICHARD MCGREGOR, EAST ASIA SENIOR FELLOW,
LOWY INSTITUTE: So when this group of doctors,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.120
I think they were university classmates from
Wuhan, began sharing the information they

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:57.060
had about a strange new virus on this joint
WeChat group, they were doing what

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.610
you'd expect medical professionals to do. To
try and sort of pool information and see what

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:07.990
was actually happening. But of course that's
a kind of dangerous thing to do in China.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:14.700
I think there's little doubt right now that
local officials in Wuhan did withhold information.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.170
They've admitted as much. The doctors in Wuhan
who were talking about it, were explicitly

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.940
told to shut up.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:29.160
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Dr Li and his colleagues
are hauled in for questioning by Wuhan police.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.240
VOICEOVER: After investigation and verification
by the public security organs, eight offenders

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.610
have been summoned and handled according to
law. The police will investigate and punish

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.420
with zero tolerance those illegal acts that
fabricate and spread rumours and

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.260
disrupt social order.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.120
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
Doctor Li was disciplined by his own hospital.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:59.120
He was even picked up by the police and taken
in, and castigated and told not to spread

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.510
rumours. This is what happens when you are
saying things publicly that the Communist

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:11.090
Party doesn't like. You're spreading rumours.
Even if somebody is trying to tell the world

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:16.520
about a potentially dangerous virus, the first
instinct is to shut them up.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.880
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Despite the risk
of retribution, critics like Dr Wu Qiang,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:28.740
who already lost his university job for defying
a ban by President Xi on teaching democracy,

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.200
continue to speak out over the government's
handling of the crisis.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.260
DR WU QIANG, CHINESE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:
They were basically concealing the truth;

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.090
although internal controls were in place,
the information kept from the public caused

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.720
the outbreak of the disaster and the spread
of the disease.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.130
RICHARD MCGREGOR, EAST ASIA SENIOR FELLOW,
LOWY INSTITUTE: That's the key point in this

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:56.000
saga. They lost about two weeks, maybe three
weeks, just when the virus was at it's sort

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.750
of nascent point, just at a time where they
could have traced it, just at a time where

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:07.210
perhaps they could have checked it more substantially.
But that was lost because it got caught up

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:12.020
in the politics of the information flow and
information surveillance in China.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.300
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Four weeks after
the first infections, China notifies the World

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.800
Health Organisation of the outbreak.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:30.000
Things are about to get worse. In early January,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.940
millions of Chinese are preparing to travel
to and from Wuhan to celebrate Chinese New

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.000
Year with their families.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.180
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
If you were to pick the most dangerous time,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.980
the worst time, for a virus to break out here,
the, the worst time for it to spread quickly

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:56.770
across China and even around the world, it
would be the lunar new year. You have hundreds

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:03.839
of millions of people criss-crossing China,
travelling overseas. And because of that mass

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:14.690
migration, the largest mass migration annually
in the world, I mean, it, it was just a terrible

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.339
time for this virus outbreak to, to happen.

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:24.760
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Australian resident
Ying Wang who lives in Melbourne, is preparing

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.660
to visit Wuhan with her husband and two children
when she hears about the outbreak.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:37.900
YING WANG: It was a couple of days after our
Christmas holiday in Melbourne, I got a video

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:47.390
sent over from my cousin in Wuhan and according to
the video there was a suspected SARS-like

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:55.870
pneumonia and I asked my cousin should I cancel
my trip? We waited until probably the first

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:02.080
week in January and then there was an official
announcement from our local government back

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:11.630
in Wuhan saying that the disease was controllable
and then we sort of, I feel relieved, so we

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:16.720
went on with our trip.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.331
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Ying Wang and her
family arrive in Wuhan on January 9. That

00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:29.140
same day a 61-year-old man who had visited
the seafood market becomes the first person

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.490
to die of coronavirus. His death is kept quiet
for two days.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.080
DR WU QIANG, CHINESE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:
During the most crucial time of the spread

00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:48.450
of disease in early Jan, Wuhan and Hubei were
holding annual political meetings. As a result,

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:53.540
the first death which occurred on January
9 was not announced until January 11. After

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.220
January 11 the data on deaths and confirmed
cases plateaued and the numbers had not changed

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.260
at all. I believe that the local authorities
concealed the truth from the public due to

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.960
political concerns.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.300
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: On January 22, the
government finally acknowledges the gravity

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.580
of the situation at a press conference in
Beijing.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.760
LI BIN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION OF CHINA: The virus might mutate and the epidemic

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.200
is at risk of spreading further. It is currently
the Spring Festival travel rush season, when

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.740
the mobility of the general public increases
sharply, which has heightened the risk of

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.020
epidemic transmission and the difficulty of
prevention and control. We must not take it

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020
lightly and be highly vigilant.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:55.060
NEWSREADER: Nine people have died and 440
people have contracted a mysterious coronavirus,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.300
as China works to stop it spreading during
the lunar new year travel rush.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:10.300
YING WANG: It was, 22nd, 22nd of January,
that was the turning point. It was Wednesday

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:18.290
and just bad news started coming in,
starting with the Chinese official news saying

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:26.180
that it's getting, getting much worse
than they expected and then all of a

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:31.741
sudden, I think it was the next day 23rd,
I remember, I woke up quite late like 10:00 AM

00:14:31.741 --> 00:14:38.709
and suddenly, my dad just told
me, oh, we can't go out now. We can't go out.

00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:40.560
We can't get out our apartment.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.840
NEWSREADER: There's been a dramatic development
this morning in the Chinese city of Wuhan

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:57.790
which is the epicentre of an outbreak of a
deadly new virus. All public transport, buses,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.360
trains, ferries and the airport have been
shut down as authorities scramble to contain

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.700
the spread of the coronavirus.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.920
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
I mean, when the authorities decided to lock

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:22.750
down that whole province of Hubei. That's
like locking down the entire population of

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:30.510
Italy and telling them you can't leave that
province. It was really the moment when everybody

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.060
knew, all right, this is a big problem.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.900
PROFESSOR SHARON LEWIN, DIRECTOR, DOHERTY
INSTITUTE: When Wuhan went into lockdown,

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:43.500
I think January the 23rd and then flights
and greater lockdown measures across China.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.780
This is unprecedented in the history of modern
medicine. We've never tried. We know that

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.360
containment can work, but it's never really
been done at this large scale.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:05.360
YING WANG: The day I learned that Wuhan
was in lockdown and I felt quite shocked

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:11.810
and I start immediately start worrying about
food, food supply. And I had to stop everything

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:18.070
on that day. Just started messaging everybody
to find out is that really the official news.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.000
How serious is this announcement?

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.060
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: By late January,
Wuhan's hospitals are struggling to cope,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.320
and medical staff are under intolerable pressure.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.540
NURSE: I can't take it anymore! (Screams)

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.540
MALE HOSPITAL WORKER: We don't want to live
anymore.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:54.380
Look at it yourselves.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.440
What on earth do you want to do?

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:04.860
I don't want people, you take them away. Take away that one lying on the floor

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.960
. Otherwise, you'd better kill me.
Let me out of here, send me home.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.860
I'm not creating trouble. So many lying there, what can I do?

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.700
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: With patient numbers
surging, construction begins on two new hospitals,

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.380
with one scheduled to open in just over a
week.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.360
NEWSREADER: Even though Chinese authorities
have shut down several cities, the world health

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.700
organisation says it's not yet a global health
emergency.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.060
PROFESSOR RAINA MACINTYRE, HEAD, BIOSECURITY
PROGRAM, UNSW KIRBY INSTITUTE: So, obviously

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:02.559
the whole world was watching very closely
through January as this epidemic unfolded,

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:08.480
and people were very concerned. A lot of experts
were concerned and felt that the Public Health

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.350
Emergency of International Concern should
have been declared earlier. I think people

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:19.910
were harking back to Ebola and what happened
there, and they were afraid of delays that

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.500
might have been very costly in terms of the
ability to save people's lives.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.120
NEWSREADER: Australia's first case of coronavirus
has been confirmed in Victoria, as New South

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.600
Wales announces it has two probable cases.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.740
DR MIKE CATTON, CO-DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DOHERTY
INSTITUTE: So, the minute we made the diagnosis

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.040
of the first case in Australia, we knew how
significant that was and we knew that we wanted

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.220
to culture the virus.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.080
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: In a major breakthrough,
Australian scientists become the first outside

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.680
China to isolate the virus in a laboratory.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.200
DR MIKE CATTON, CO-DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DOHERTY
INSTITUTE: Okay, it's definitely growing.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.570
It started at 30, so that's three long. So,
a thousand times stronger. Awesome. So, it's

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.880
definitely growing. So, we've got it. Fantastic.
Yep.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.640
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: CSIRO scientists
begin growing the virus in their highest security

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.220
laboratory, reserved for the most deadly pathogens.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.620
PROFESSOR TREVOR DREW, DIRECTOR, CSIRO AUSTRALIAN ANIMAL HEALTH LABORATORY: We don't actually

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.640
know how dangerous this virus is. We know
it kills people, but we don't know how many,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:42.080
and we don't know exactly what the mechanism
is by which this virus kills people. So at

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.050
the moment we're taking the highest level
of precautions.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.220
DR ROB GRENFELL, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND BIOSECURITY, CSIRO: Our staff can only usually work about

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.950
four hours in those suits and in those conditions,
because it's very stressful to imagine you're

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.280
actually working with such high volatile agents.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.360
PROFESSOR TREVOR DREW, DIRECTOR, CSIRO AUSTRALIAN ANIMAL HEALTH LABORATORY: So the most important

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.710
thing that we're doing at the moment is growing
the virus to produce more of it so that we

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:19.549
can understand more about the characteristics
of this virus, and also how it behaves in

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:24.150
a biological model so that we can see the
progress of the disease.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.720
DR ROB GRENFELL, DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND BIOSECURITY, CSIRO: So, we will then introduce the virus

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.270
into our test animals, on this occasion ferrets,
because their respiratory system is very similar

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:40.640
to humans. And the idea here is to understand
how that infection progresses and how it behaves.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.700
This is very important for us to understand
because if we can't understand how the

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.540
infection progresses and in which way it progresses
we can't understand how vaccines work.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.840
SCIENTIST: So, I think this will be ready
to harvest tomorrow.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.440
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: In China, the escalating
number of infections prompts a rare outburst

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.960
of anger online against authorities.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.660
WUHAN RESIDENT: I want to fucking ask, can
you find another country on this planet that

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.400
is such fucking bullshit?

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.270
Can you find another country on this planet, another government

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:40.470
to fuck shit up like this? Wuhan is like fucking
hell right now. To see them just drop dead

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:49.120
or all kinds of scenarios, all those tragedies.
Today is the first day of the Lunar New Year.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:56.480
It should have been a happy time. Can you
say that the Wuhan people or Chinese people

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.320
feel happy now?

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:03.791
DR WU QIANG, CHINESE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:
It can be said that the more than 900 million

00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:08.470
Chinese citizens who are equipped with smart
phones have been extremely dissatisfied with

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:13.980
the situation of Wuhan pneumonia in the past
one month or so. From my own observation,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.630
this level of dissatisfaction is unprecedented
in the past eight years. They have been tremendously

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:25.560
dissatisfied with Wuhan local government's
ineffectiveness in epidemic and disaster relief,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.160
the predicament the Wuhan people have been
put into from the city lockdown, the paralysis

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.440
of the local medical institutions, and the
huge risk they have to face.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.180
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: As authorities desperately
try to stop the virus spreading, Wuhan is

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.340
effectively cut off from the rest of China.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.460
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
We decided to go into Hubei province to have

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.320
a look what it was like, right inside the
virus hot zone.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.280
As we got closer and closer to Hubei, the road

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.160
blocks were becoming more serious, and in
fact looked like something out of an apocalyptic

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.180
movie. The police are making all the cars
pull over to the side.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:44.000
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
So basically, that's the border that way.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.760
The police have told us that we can drive
in but we can't drive out.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.260
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
We drove through a series of ghost towns.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:57.840
I mean, nobody on the streets, shops closed,
the shutters were down. And this is during

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.960
Spring festival. Normally this is a time when
you'd have fireworks, families, friends gathering

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:10.260
to have meals together, celebrating, being
happy, and instead it was completely dead,

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.800
and in fact, pretty eerie.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.420
NEWSREADER: The outbreak of the coronavirus
in China has finally been declared a global

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.890
health emergency after a rapid escalation
in the number of infections during the past

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:31.160
week. There are almost 8,000 cases in 18 countries,
including 9 in Australia.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.900
STEPHEN MCDONELL, BBC CHINA CORRESPONDENT:
So here I am, sitting at home and reporting

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.530
from where I live. That's because after returning
from Hubei province at the heart of the coronavirus

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:50.350
outbreak, everybody's told you need to go
into quarantine, you can't be exposed to others

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:56.750
for several weeks. This city, Beijing, if
I look out the window, it's dead. I mean,

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:04.051
there are hardly any people in the streets.
Friends here don't want to go outdoors. That's

00:25:04.051 --> 00:25:09.580
because they're afraid of catching the coronavirus,
and the same is happening all over the countries,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400
all these mega-cities in China.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.740
NEWSREADER: The government is taking drastic
action to stem the coronavirus. Foreign nationals

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.340
coming from China are now banned from entering
the country.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.620
PROFESSOR RAINA MACINTYRE, HEAD, BIOSECURITY
PROGRAM, UNSW KIRBY INSTITUTE: I think from

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.800
a disease control point of view, we want to
continue these for as long as is feasible.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:07.000
There's just so many major economic consequences
of the travel ban that I think at some point

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.530
we'll have to make the decision to lift the
bans, but if we can keep them going as long

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:17.000
as possible, that will be beneficial from
a disease control point of view.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.919
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Hundreds of Australians
remain trapped in Hubei province.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:33.760
YING WANG: So, this is the view from my window,
and it's been really good weather today, but

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:41.170
we're not going out. And this is our central
garden on level six. So, it's a bit shame

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:46.280
that we're stuck at home, otherwise it could
be a really good day out.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:53.360
YING WANG: I really just want a more firm
answer from anywhere really, from WHO or,

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.650
or, or my local government. So how, how bad
really is? I- I'm still having this question.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:04.820
How serious is this whole pandemic? Even though
everyday we watch the numbers, infected number

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:12.980
of people, also the death toll keep going
up. Just, yeah, I need to, I don't

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:20.480
know, I need someone to assure me this is
some ... I don't know, I feel like the end of the world.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.780
TIM MCLEAN: Morning folks. It's Thursday 6th February.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.160
Middle of a ghost town here.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.300
1.3 million people all hiding.
It's raining, it's a miserable day.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.880
Death toll is, what, 545 today.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:52.860
Um, 16,800-odd people
in hospital in my district.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.320
Waiting on DFAT to give us an answer about when I can get out of here.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.440
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Australian Tim McLean
is stranded on the outskirts of Wuhan. He's

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:10.419
trying to get his Chinese partner a visa to
come to Australia.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:18.159
TIM MCLEAN: Um, Foreign Affairs just contacted
me. I just hung up the phone. Um, they just

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:24.610
confirmed, and wanted to let me know, that my spouse Xu Qiong didn't make the

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:32.890
list for the flight with Qantas, and asked
me if I was still interested in leaving.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.660
I informed them that I'm not leaving without her.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.480
It's dire here. It's very dire. There's

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.980
queues outside the hospitals now. We're not
allowed near them. There's people dropping

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:52.740
on the footpath, literally. Okay?  I know
how bad it is. I can't wait to get out

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.360
of here. It's- it's terrible.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:09.540
TIM MCLEAN: So, this is them spraying outside
our front door, they have been doing this

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.440
through the city regularly.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:18.840
The local council have been going out and spraying disinfectant around everybody's doorways.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.760
So I suspect they're spraying to stop infections coming
out of the sewer.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.000
I better go in and shut the door.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:42.200
I've seen medical folks turn up
two doors away from me, 20 metres from my

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:48.580
front door, and take a lady away that was
infected. They also took her son.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:56.280
The son returned home 24 hours later; he was okay.
We haven't seen or heard of the lady since.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.820
PROFESSOR RAINA MACINTYRE: So, people

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:04.280
have been concerned about the human rights
aspects of quarantine and isolation of

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:09.440
cases, quarantine of contacts, et cetera, and
that's been happening on a very large scale

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:17.100
in China but also in Australia and other countries.
From a disease control point of view, putting

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.680
aside other issues, from a disease control
point of view it works.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.180
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Videos emerge on social media

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.120
of authorities using increasingly drastic measures.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:49.880
RESIDENT (in Mandarin): Forced quarantine.
The whole family of four. Go. Hurry up. Leave.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.700
No filming allowed.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.120
Go.
What are you doing?

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:06.080
Can you leave me alone?

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.600
- Get in there. 
- No.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.060
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Around China, residents
post scenes claiming officials are welding

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.340
the doors of apartment buildings shut so people
can't get out.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.840
Woman (in Mandarin): Hey look, is that the
door? They are welding the door. That's a

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:35.240
door in the middle, look.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.320
Terrible.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.620
They are welding the door, not allowing people to get out.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.760
Next will be our block, Block 6.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:54.100
TIM MCLEAN: I'm very concerned about getting
this virus. I'm not even 100 metres away from

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:59.400
one of the hospitals that's full. I've
seen people entering that hospital. I've seen,

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:05.020
people getting rolled out on stretchers
out of that hospital. It's literally across

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:12.020
the road from where I come out of my apartment.
Now, that's concerning.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:19.380
My hospitals here are full. We've run out of medical supplies here.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:24.240
There's no PPE, or personal protective equipment available anymore,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.391
so the doctors have all gone to the bigger hospitals.

00:32:27.391 --> 00:32:32.580
They're shipping our sick and our, you know, the people that are in bad condition, they're

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.640
taking them to Wuhan. The Wuhan hospitals
are also full now.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.580
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: By early February
the virus is in 25 countries,

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.560
with 216 cases outside China.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.480
PROFESSOR TREVOR DREW: The most likely

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.090
way that the virus is traveling outside of
China is by infected people. So these people,

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:09.640
they are perhaps in the early stages of the
disease and perhaps not showing very many

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:16.330
clinical signs. So, they are able to get onto
planes and they're quite happy to travel,

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:20.740
and in all innocence they are spreading the
disease as they travel.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.700
PROFESSOR NEIL FERGUSON, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON: We think 10% or less

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:32.380
of all infections in china are being detected at the current time. We estimate that up to 50,000

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:37.700
new infections a day occur in China, which
is obviously much larger than the

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.820
official case numbers.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.260
NEWSREADER: Almost 4,000 passengers, including
more than 200 Australians, have spent their

00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.110
first 24 hours officially in quarantine on
board a cruise ship off Japan. They'll be

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:05.400
isolated on board for the next fortnight,
with some passengers growing anxious as their

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.820
crucial medicines are beginning to run out.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.140
PROFESSOR RAINA MACINTYRE: We know that cruise ships

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.980
are at high risk for outbreaks.
It's well documented that you get outbreaks

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:28.200
of influenza, norovirus, gastro and so on,
on cruise ships. They are closed small communities

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.310
in a very small space compared to, say, a
country. So obviously you can get more intense

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:36.080
transmission once an outbreak starts.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.060
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Shocking news breaks
that the man who had first warned of the outbreak

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.620
has died of coronavirus.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:56.140
NEWSREADER: In China, censors are working
overtime to contain an outpouring of anger

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:01.050
and grief over the death of the doctor who
blew the whistle on the coronavirus crisis.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:06.930
Li Wenliang died from the virus in a Wuhan
hospital five weeks after being punished by

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.600
authorities for warning others of a dangerous
new virus.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.920
RICHARD MCGREGOR, EAST ASIA SENIOR FELLOW,
LOWY INSTITUTE: There was a huge outpouring

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:35.980
of grief, anger, frustration, on Chinese social
media. And not just from so-called netizens

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:41.589
on Chinese-style Reddit forums or something,
but from the Supreme Court of China who put

00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:45.580
out a statement saying that, you know, these
doctors were heroes, they should have been

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.360
allowed to do their job.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.490
DR WU QIANG, CHINESE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:
The public intellectuals and the public both

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:56.410
realised that Dr Li represents the conscience
of China. He was suppressed from the beginning

00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:00.790
from telling the truth. He could have saved
the livelihood of tens of thousands of people,

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:06.080
or thousands of people's lives. But all this
was concealed due to the authority's suppression

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.820
of free speech. I believe the public expressed
their dissatisfaction with the government

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.940
by commemorating him.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.900
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: The death toll reaches
a critical milestone ... numbers

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.300
overtaking the killed by SARS.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.260
HOSPITAL WORKER (in Mandarin): How can we
take any more patients in here?

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.740
What else can we do? I don't know what you can do.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.980
What about these patients lying here?

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.440
Many patients are lying on the ground. It is full here.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.960
Woman (in Mandarin): Three bodies have been
lying here all morning.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.900
Some of them died in the middle of the night.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.900
But until now, nobody has come to handle it.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.060
Doctors and nurses are all working under these conditions

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.400
WUHAN HOSPITAL WORKER (in Mandarin): Okay
you have seen him, just keep going.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.480
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: After being conspicuously
absent, President Xi emerges on state media

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.900
to assert his authority.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.680
XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT: Ni Hao! Let's
not shake hands in this special time. But

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.940
we must have confidence that we will overcome
this crisis.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.140
RICHARD MCGREGOR: Xi has really lost control

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:56.660
of the narrative, and he's struggling to get
it back. Now if that goes on, if they don't

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:01.599
get on top of the virus, then that can really
damage his image I think, even with ordinary

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:07.880
Chinese people, and that has potentially profound
implications, because two, three years down

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.760
the track, when he's meant to be reappointed,
maybe his enemies will use this against him.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.290
DR WU QIANG, CHINESE POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:
So, the people directed this kind of dissatisfaction

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:23.020
directly to Xi himself and Xi's style of governance
which is I believe the most serious threat

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:28.880
to Xi Jinping. This is because the foundation
of his power is based largely on populism

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.880
and the loss of this populist foundation will
undoubtedly destabilise his position in the party.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:43.080
NEWSREADER: Australians still trapped in the
coronavirus epicentre in China  are tonight preparing

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.930
for a second attempt at an evacuation flight
to Darwin.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.440
TIM MCLEAN: There is a seat available for
my partner Qiong and myself on the next available

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.350
flight out of Wuhan, which apparently is leaving
at midnight tonight. We've got three or

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:06.130
four hours to get to the airport. They've
sent us- sent us all our passes, et cetera,

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:11.760
so we can get through the checkpoints. It's all confirmed. We've got the emails.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.780
We've got the thumbs up. So, we're out of
here. We're heading home.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.420
Can't wait. And super excited.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:28.700
YING WANG: So, today's our last day in Wuhan.
It's been a pretty long journey the past two

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:37.540
weeks. More than two weeks we've been quarantined
for more than two weeks. So, tomorrow we're

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:43.620
going to get out and go to the airport and
come back to Australia. So, it's still, it's

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.700
still unreal for me.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:08.880
YING WANG: Reaching the airport toll gate,
looks like we are in the checkpoint.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.920
It's 2.30, kids are not asleep. I'm super tired.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.500
We're still waiting. About half of the plane

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:44.840
still waiting to be cleared of security and
passport control and stuff.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.620
A lot of paperwork, a lot of screening, a lot of questions.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.720
Just very, very stressful really.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.040
Let's go! Out of here! Yes, we're out of 
here, going home.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.140
SEAN NICHOLLS, REPORTER: Tim McLean isn't
on the flight. Quarantine restrictions mean

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:14.780
he hasn't been able to get any transport to
the airport. So, he's still stuck in Hubei province.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:25.160
TIM MCLEAN: I'm absolutely fucking petrified
now. 1300 odd people are dead here.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:30.120
The police are actually knocking on doors and taking temperatures and if people have got a temperature,

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:35.000
they're dragging them out, mate. You don't
get a fucking say in it.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.900
You don't get an option.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:44.940
You get taken away and put with a bunch of other sick people.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:52.020
Not only are we in quarantine but it's beyond quarantine now.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:58.880
It's... I don't even know what to call it.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.680
It's quite terrifying knowing that people
can knock on your door here and drag you out for

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.020
no reason at all, because you've got a temperature.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.660
PROFESSOR SHARON LEWIN, DIRECTOR, DOHERTY
INSTITUTE: At the moment we don't have a good

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:24.609
understanding of the real mortality rate for
the novel coronavirus. It's estimated about

00:42:24.609 --> 00:42:32.140
2 per cent. So if the mortality rate is 2%,
if it's 1%, even if it's 0.5% and 300 million

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:38.020
people get infected, that's a lot of people
that could potentially die. Because if you

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:43.770
think back into the Spanish flu, enormous
numbers of people died, but the actual mortality

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:48.460
rate was less than 1% but a huge number of
people were infected.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.560
WOMAN: Help! My mother is dying! Someone come
quickly! I have no way out!

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.380
There is really no way out!

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:03.660
Everyone, please help me! I have
no other way!

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.290
NEWSREADER: The World Health Organisation
is this morning warning that the coronavirus

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.800
could pose a greater global threat than terrorism.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.720
DR TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION: A virus can have

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:30.560
more powerful consequences than any terrorist
action. And that's true. And if the world

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:40.101
doesn't want to wake up and consider this
enemy virus as public enemy number one, I

00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:43.180
don't think we will learn from our lessons.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.460
PROFESSOR TREVOR DREW: We just don't know

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:50.220
how this outbreak is going to develop, or
how many people are ultimately going to be

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:55.680
infected, or ultimately going to die from
this disease. We don't yet know exactly how

00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:01.560
the virus is evolving. We don't know
how many people are actually infected that

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:07.170
are not revealed to be infected. And we don't know how many people are dying that are misdiagnosed

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:13.520
as dying from  other disease. So, this
is a real problem for us to be able to make

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.100
any real prediction, or to model the spread
of this disease.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.300
PROFESSOR SHARON LEWIN: I think the worst case scenario

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:26.960
is that we are unable to contain the virus,
that we see sustained human-to-human transmission

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.280
in many parts of the world.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.100
NEWSREADER: The World Health Organisation
says the window of opportunity to contain

00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:41.820
the coronavirus outbreak is narrowing. The
statement comes as concerns grow in South

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.790
Korea and the Middle East about the number
of cases. There have also been more cases

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:52.840
confirmed among Australians evacuated from
a cruise ship in Japan.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.520
TIM MCLEAN: So, I really don't know what the
near future is going to bring. We've got no

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:15.440
information about how long we're going to
be in here. There's no indication whatsoever.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.050
I've got sick people living next door to me,
I've got sick people above me, I've got sick

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:26.430
people across the lane from me. Some of those
people have got chains on their doors so people

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:33.460
can't access them because they're ill. I'm
hiding from a virus that you can't see and

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.780
a government that you don't want to muck around
with.
