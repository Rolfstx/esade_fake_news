Fred Ryan:
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:03.700
I'm Fred Ryan, Chairman of
the Board of the White House

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.100
Historical Association.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.533
The Association is honored to
be part of today's historic

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.133
ceremony and to have played
a role in arranging for the

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.800
magnificent portraits that
are about to be unveiled.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.834
The White House Historical
Association was founded

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:20.767
50 years ago by First Lady
Jacqueline Kennedy with two

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:22.633
specific missions.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:26.000
The first is to educate and
inform the public about the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.467
history of the White House
and the distinguished group

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:31.400
of Americans that
have inhabited it.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.800
In this regard, it is an
exciting time for us as we mark

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.700
our 50th anniversary campaign
for White House history.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.834
To the north of the White House
at the historic Decatur House we

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:44.400
have just launched the new David
Rubenstein National Center for

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.300
White House History.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
Next year, to the south
of the White House,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
we will open a newly redesigned
White House visitors center.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.000
It will give the millions of
visitors to Washington each

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.834
year a chance to gain a broader
understanding of life in the

00:00:57.834 --> 00:00:58.967
White House.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:01.233
If we can just acquire
something on the east and west,

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:02.667
we'll have the place surrounded.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.500
(laughter)

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.633
The other mission of the
association is to provide

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:10.100
funds to preserve the White
House public rooms and enhance

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.133
its incomparable collection
of decorative and fine arts.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.433
Over the five decades and ten
presidents since our founding,

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:21.467
the Association is proud to have
provided nearly $40 million in

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:24.433
financial support for
refurbishing and making

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:28.000
important acquisitions
for the White House.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.600
Through the portraits of our
presidents and first ladies,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.300
it's a wonderful tradition that
here in America's house our

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.967
country honors those
who have honored us.

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:40.033
The tradition began with
the acquisition of George

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.934
Washington's portrait in 1800.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.667
It was purchased by the
United States government.

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.533
It was viewed as such an
important national treasure,

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.467
it was the object of Dolly
Madison's greatest concerns

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:55.033
when the British burned
the White House in 1814.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.200
The White House Historical
Association has been privileged

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.433
to commission the official
portrait of every president

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:01.700
and first lady over
the last 50 years,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.600
and to acquire historical
portraits of those who were

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.133
previously missing from
the White House collection.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.600
In our digital world, where so
many images are mere flashes

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.400
on a screen, these enduring
portraits of great Americans by

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.133
acclaimed artists are lasting
tributes to our presidents and

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.600
first ladies and will
forever be part of the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.633
White House collection.

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:27.133
Today, the portraits
of President George W.

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:30.967
Bush and First Lady Laura Bush
will be added to this unique

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:34.000
collection of those who have
occupied this house and served

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.567
our nation with distinction.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:40.133
And to those great presidential
portrait artists whose works

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:44.233
here include Gilbert Stuart,
John Singer Sargent and Aaron

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:48.533
Shikler we now add
John Howard Sanden.

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:52.100
So today's event may once
again prompt one of those

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.033
great debates that's taken place
often within the White House.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:57.000
Strong arguments will
be made on both sides.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.533
It's not a debate over
issues or between parties.

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:02.967
It's a debate as to whether the
portrait actually looks like the

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.066
President and First Lady.

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:05.333
(laughter)

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:08.033
And we will soon find that out.

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:10.734
It is now my distinct pleasure
to introduce the President of

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:11.700
the United States.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.500
(applause)

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.333
President Obama:
Thank you.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.300
Thank you so much.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.467
(applause)

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:25.600
Thank you.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.033
Please, everybody, have a seat.

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.400
Well, good afternoon, everybody.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.500
Thank you, Fred, for
that introduction.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.734
To President George
H.W. Bush and Barbara,

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:41.066
to all the members of the
Bush family who are here --

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:45.533
it is a great privilege
to have you here today.

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:49.400
And to President and Mrs. Bush,
welcome back to the house that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.233
you called home for eight years.

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:56.033
The White House is
many things at once.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:04:00.200
It's a working office,
it's a living museum,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.000
it's an enduring symbol
of our democracy.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.734
But at the end of the day, when
the visitors go home and the

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:11.700
lights go down, a few of us are
blessed with the tremendous

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.000
honor to actually live here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.066
I think it's fair to say that
every President is acutely aware

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:23.800
that we are just temporary
residents -- we're renters here.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.800
We're charged with the upkeep
until our lease runs out.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.934
But we also leave a piece
of ourselves in this place.

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:35.900
And today, with the unveiling
of the portraits next to me,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.533
President and Mrs. Bush will
take their place alongside men

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:43.533
and women who built this
country and those who worked

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.800
to perfect it.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.033
It's been said that no one can
ever truly understand what it's

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:52.533
like being President until they
sit behind that desk and feel

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.133
the weight and responsibility
for the first time.

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:57.100
And that is true.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.066
After three and a half years
in office -- and much more

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:00.867
gray hair --

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:01.867
(laughter)

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:05.100
-- I have a deeper understanding
of the challenges faced by the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.433
Presidents who came before
me, including my immediate

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:12.033
predecessor, President Bush.

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:16.100
In this job, no decision that
reaches your desk is easy.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.000
No choice you make
is without costs.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.166
No matter how hard you try,
you're not going to make

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.166
everybody happy.

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.700
I think that's something
President Bush and I both

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.600
learned pretty quickly.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.567
(laughter)

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:29.500
And that's why,
from time to time,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.900
those of us who have had the
privilege to hold this office

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.734
find ourselves turning to the
only people on Earth who know

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.266
the feeling.

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:38.100
We may have our
differences politically,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.700
but the presidency transcends
those differences.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.567
We all love this country.

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:46.333
We all want America to succeed.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.433
We all believe that when it
comes to moving this country

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:52.000
forward, we have an
obligation to pull together.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.900
And we all follow the humble,
heroic example of our first

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.834
President, George Washington,
who knew that a true test of

00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:05.133
patriotism is the willingness
to freely and graciously pass

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:08.367
the reins of power
on to somebody else.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:12.533
That's certainly been
true of President Bush.

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:14.800
The months before I took
the oath of office were

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.300
a chaotic time.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.834
We knew our economy
was in trouble,

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:21.500
our fellow Americans
were in pain,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.066
but we wouldn't know until
later just how breathtaking

00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:28.300
the financial crisis had been.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.266
And still, over those two and a
half months -- in the midst of

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:37.633
that crisis -- President
Bush, his Cabinet, his staff,

00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:42.633
many of you who are here today,
went out of your ways -- George,

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:46.266
you went out of your way -- to
make sure that the transition to

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:49.734
a new administration was
as seamless as possible.

00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:52.867
President Bush understood that
rescuing our economy was not

00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:55.633
just a Democratic or
a Republican issue;

00:06:55.633 --> 00:06:59.100
it was a American priority.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.567
I'll always be
grateful for that.

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.834
The same is true for
our national security.

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:08.133
None of us will ever forget
where we were on that terrible

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:11.100
September day when our
country was attacked.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.133
All of us will always remember
the image of President Bush

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:20.033
standing on that pile of
rubble, bullhorn in hand,

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:25.333
conveying extraordinary strength
and resolve to the American

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:27.800
people but also representing
the strength and resolve of

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.000
the American people.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.367
And last year, when we delivered
justice to Osama bin Laden,

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:37.667
I made it clear that our success
was due to many people in many

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:39.734
organizations working
together over many

00:07:39.734 --> 00:07:42.600
years -- across
two administrations.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.000
That's why my first call once
American forces were safely out

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.266
of harm's way was
to President Bush.

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:53.900
Because protecting our country
is neither the work of one

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.600
person, nor the task
of one period of time,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.300
it's an ongoing obligation
that we all share.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.233
Finally, on a personal note,
Michelle and I are grateful

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:07.500
to the entire Bush family for
their guidance and their example

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.266
during our own transition.

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:13.467
George, I will always remember
the gathering you hosted for all

00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:16.166
the living former Presidents
before I took office,

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:18.533
your kind words
of encouragement.

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:22.333
Plus, you also left me a
really good TV sports package.

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:31.800
(laughter)

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.633
I use it.

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:35.166
(laughter)

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:38.767
Laura, you reminded us that
the most rewarding thing about

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:41.166
living in this house isn't
the title or the power,

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:43.600
but the chance to shine a
spotlight on the issues that

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.000
matter most.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.567
And the fact that you and
George raised two smart,

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:52.934
beautiful daughters -- first,
as girls visiting their

00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:56.433
grandparents and then as
teenagers preparing to head out

00:08:56.433 --> 00:09:00.166
into the world -- that obviously
gives Michelle and I tremendous

00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:04.400
hope as we try to do the right
thing by our own daughters in

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.934
this slightly odd atmosphere
that we've created.

00:09:09.934 --> 00:09:14.033
Jenna and Barbara, we will never
forget the advice you gave Sasha

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:17.000
and Malia as they began
their lives in Washington.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.767
They told them to surround
themselves with loyal friends,

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:22.533
never stop doing what
they love; to slide down

00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:24.066
the banisters occasionally --

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:24.633
(laughter)

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:28.667
-- to play Sardines on the lawn;
to meet new people and try new

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:33.500
things; and to try to absorb
everything and enjoy all of it.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.433
And I can tell you that
Malia and Sasha took that

00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:36.433
advice to heart.

00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:38.133
It really meant a lot to them.

00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:43.633
One of the greatest strengths of
our democracy is our ability to

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:48.033
peacefully, and routinely, go
through transitions of power.

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:50.767
It speaks to the fact that
we've always had leaders who

00:09:50.767 --> 00:09:54.100
believe in America, and
everything it stands for,

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.300
above all else -- leaders and
their families who are willing

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.667
to devote their lives to
the country that they love.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.800
This is what we'll think about
every time we pass these

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.500
portraits -- just as millions
of other visitors will do in

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.700
the decades, and perhaps
even the centuries to come.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.033
I want to thank
John Howard Sanden,

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:16.800
the artist behind
these beautiful works,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.667
for his efforts.

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:20.767
And on behalf of
the American people,

00:10:20.767 --> 00:10:26.233
I want to thank most sincerely
President and Mrs. Bush for

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:29.000
their extraordinary
service to our country.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.200
And now I'd like to invite
them on stage to take part

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.467
in the presentation.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:54.667
(applause)

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:59.000
(portraits are unveiled)

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:28.400
(applause)

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.233
President Bush:
Thank you, sit down.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.867
Sit down.

00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:43.567
Behave yourselves.

00:11:43.567 --> 00:11:44.767
(laughter)

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:47.033
Mr. President, thank you
for your warm hospitality.

00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:50.233
Madam First Lady, thank
you so much for inviting

00:11:50.233 --> 00:11:51.600
our rowdy friends --

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.533
(laughter)

00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:54.433
-- to my hanging.

00:11:54.433 --> 00:11:56.100
(laughter)

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.266
Laura and I are
honored to be here.

00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:58.800
Mr. Vice President,
thank you for coming.

00:12:01.133 --> 00:12:07.033
We are overwhelmed
by your hospitality.

00:12:07.033 --> 00:12:11.433
And thank you for
feeding the Bush family,

00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:13.233
all 14 members of
us who are here.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.166
(laughter)

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.033
I want to thank our
girls for coming.

00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:19.700
I thank Mom and Dad,
brother, sister, in-laws,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.367
aunts and uncles.

00:12:21.367 --> 00:12:22.700
I appreciate you
taking your time.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.767
I know you're as excited as
Laura and me to be able to

00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:30.500
come back here, and particularly
thank the people who helped make

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.467
this house a home for
us for eight years,

00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:34.767
the White House staff.

00:12:34.767 --> 00:12:38.066
I want to thank Fred Ryan and
the White House Historical

00:12:38.066 --> 00:12:43.734
Association and Bill Allman,
the White House curator.

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:47.400
I am pleased that my portrait
brings an interesting symmetry

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.867
to the White House collection.

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:53.367
It now starts and
ends with a George W.

00:12:53.367 --> 00:12:56.800
(laughter and applause)

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.934
When the British
burned the White House,

00:12:59.934 --> 00:13:06.400
as Fred mentioned, in 1814,
Dolley Madison famously saved

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.266
this portrait of
the first George W.

00:13:09.266 --> 00:13:14.233
(laughter)

00:13:14.233 --> 00:13:22.333
Now, Michelle, if anything
happens there's your man.

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:35.734
(laughter and applause)

00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:38.734
I am also pleased,
Mr. President,

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:41.400
that when you are wandering
these halls as you wrestle with

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.600
tough decisions, you will now be
able to gaze at this portrait

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.800
and ask, what would George do?

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:57.834
(laughter)

00:13:57.834 --> 00:14:00.567
I am honored to be hanging near
a man who gave me the greatest

00:14:00.567 --> 00:14:04.433
gift possible, unconditional
love -- and that would be

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:05.767
number 41.

00:14:05.767 --> 00:14:43.633
(applause)

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:46.934
I want to thank John Howard
Sanden for agreeing to use

00:14:46.934 --> 00:14:51.467
his considerable talents
to paint my likeness.

00:14:51.467 --> 00:14:54.367
You've done a fine job
with a challenging subject.

00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:56.000
(laughter)

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.500
In the portrait, there's
a painting by W.H.D. Koerner

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.567
called, "A Charge to Keep."

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:04.767
It hung in the Oval Office for
eight years of my presidency.

00:15:04.767 --> 00:15:07.934
I asked John to include it,
because it reminds me of the

00:15:07.934 --> 00:15:12.000
wonderful people with whom
I was privileged to serve.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.767
Whether they served in the
Cabinet or on the presidential

00:15:14.767 --> 00:15:19.166
staff, these men and women --
many of whom are here -- worked

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:22.100
hard and served with honor.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.233
We had a charge to keep
and we kept the charge.

00:15:26.233 --> 00:15:32.433
It is my privilege to introduce
the greatest First Lady ever --

00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:33.266
sorry, Mom.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:42.000
(laughter)

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.233
Would you agree to a tie?

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.400
(laughter)

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.400
A woman who brought such
grace and dignity and love

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.367
in this house.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:57.266
(applause)

00:15:57.266 --> 00:15:58.000
Mrs. Bush:
Thank you all.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.066
(applause)

00:16:00.066 --> 00:16:00.734
Thank you, everybody.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.100
Thank you very much.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.734
Thank you, darling.

00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:27.533
Thank you, President
and Mrs. Obama.

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:31.000
Thank you for your kindness
and your consideration today.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.500
It was really gracious of you
to invite us back to the White

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.900
House to hang a few
family pictures.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.533
(laughter)

00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:42.400
And I'm sure you know nothing
makes a house a home like having

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.000
portraits of its former
occupants staring down

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.400
at you from the walls.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.900
(laughter)

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.467
This is not the first time I've
had the opportunity to confront

00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:58.767
an artistic likeness of myself.

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:03.066
A few years ago, just
after the 2008 election,

00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:05.834
a friend sent me something he'd
found in the gift shop of the

00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:09.834
National Constitutional
Center in Philadelphia.

00:17:09.834 --> 00:17:12.033
It was a Laura Bush
bobblehead doll.

00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:13.600
(laughter)

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.567
He said he found it on
the clearance shelf.

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.333
(laughter)

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:21.000
But I'm flattered and grateful
to know that this particular

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.433
work has a permanent home.

00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:27.300
And thanks to the masterful
talent of John Howard Sanden,

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.367
I like it a whole lot better
than I do that bobblehead doll.

00:17:31.367 --> 00:17:32.834
(laughter)

00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:36.633
Thank you very much, John Howard
Sanden -- you're terrific to

00:17:36.633 --> 00:17:37.734
work with.

00:17:37.734 --> 00:17:39.800
And thanks to Elizabeth
and your family who have

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.867
joined you today.

00:17:40.867 --> 00:17:42.066
Thank you very, very much, John.

00:17:42.867 --> 00:17:52.033
(applause)

00:17:52.033 --> 00:17:57.734
And, of course, it's meaningful
to me as a private person to

00:17:57.734 --> 00:18:02.767
know that these portraits will
be on view at the White House,

00:18:02.767 --> 00:18:05.767
that my portrait will hang
just down the hall from my

00:18:05.767 --> 00:18:10.467
mother-in-law, and that George's
portrait will hang very close to

00:18:10.467 --> 00:18:11.467
his dad's.

00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:15.934
But what's more meaningful
is it's meaningful to me

00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:17.633
as a citizen.

00:18:17.633 --> 00:18:20.867
This was our family's
home for eight years.

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:24.433
It was our home, but
it wasn't our house.

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:27.667
This house belongs to the people
whose portraits will never hang

00:18:27.667 --> 00:18:32.233
here, the ordinary and
not-so-ordinary people whose

00:18:32.233 --> 00:18:37.533
lives inspired us and whose
expectations guided us during

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:40.100
the years that we lived here.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.066
In this room are many of the
people who stood by us as we

00:18:45.066 --> 00:18:47.900
faced the tragedy
of September 11th,

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.734
and who worked with
us in the years after.

00:18:50.734 --> 00:18:53.533
Thanks to each and every
one of you for your service

00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:54.433
to our country.

00:18:54.433 --> 00:19:05.300
(applause)

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.200
I hope others will see in this
portrait what I see: a woman who

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.800
was honored and humbled to live
in the White House during a

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.533
period of great challenge,
and who will never forget

00:19:17.533 --> 00:19:21.300
the countless American faces
who make up the true portrait

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.000
of that time.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.266
Thank you all very much.

00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:25.033
Thanks so much.

00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:27.200
And thank you, Michelle,
if you want to come up.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:20:00.266
(applause)

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:01.600
The First Lady:
Well, I don't think
we have enough tissue

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.367
to go around.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:04.233
(laughter)

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:06.000
Jenna and Barbara,
they're just a mess.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
(laughter)

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.100
But I want to thank
President and Mrs. Bush

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.667
for joining us today.

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:17.266
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank Laura

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:23.467
for providing such a wonderful
model of strength and grace for

00:20:23.467 --> 00:20:26.600
me to follow as First Lady.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:34.266
It is an interesting job, and
it's just been amazing to learn

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:37.700
from your example not
just as a First Lady,

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.734
but as a mother of two
wonderful daughters.

00:20:41.734 --> 00:20:44.233
You're on the other side
of where we hope to be --

00:20:44.233 --> 00:20:46.266
(laughter)

00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:48.900
-- in a couple of years -- two
daughters that sit up straight

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.233
and cry when they're --

00:20:50.233 --> 00:20:51.200
(laughter)

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.133
-- and think lovingly about
their mom and their dad.

00:20:54.133 --> 00:20:55.934
(laughter)

00:20:55.934 --> 00:20:59.100
We're working towards that goal,
but you've done a terrific job.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.600
And I also want to echo Barack.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.500
We couldn't be more thankful for
the warmth and graciousness that

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.000
both of you showed -- all of you
showed -- our family when we

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.066
moved in three years ago.

00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:19.433
It is truly, truly a privilege
for us to occupy this house.

00:21:19.433 --> 00:21:22.767
And hopefully, we are setting
the same example of warmth and

00:21:22.767 --> 00:21:28.000
love and hope that you
all have provided as well.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.467
The warmth is truly
reflected in these portraits,

00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:33.100
and I promise you --

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.000
(laughter)

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.033
-- I promise, I'm
going straight for --

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:42.834
(laughter)

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:46.834
-- and I'm sure it will be
closer right down the stairs,

00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:49.200
and I'll get right to it.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.767
So I am thrilled for all of
the White House visitors who

00:21:51.767 --> 00:21:54.900
will soon have the chance
to enjoy them as well.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:00.200
And I'm thrilled for both of you
as you join these incredible

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.700
Americans whose portraits are
already displayed here at the

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.900
White House.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.567
So congratulations again.

00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:09.834
Congratulations on the
work that you have done,

00:22:09.834 --> 00:22:12.900
the example that you have
provided to this country,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.433
and what it means to
be an American family.

00:22:15.433 --> 00:22:19.700
We are so happy and proud
and honored to be a part.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.633
And with that, it is my pleasure
to invite you all to join us for

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:27.400
a reception right outside
in the State Room.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.367
Now it's time to eat.

00:22:28.367 --> 00:22:29.500
(laughter)

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.467
Thank you all so much.

00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:49.600
(applause)
