00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.403
[sirens]

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:04.804
We're headed to
a traffic complaint

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:08.007
right now that's believed to be
a possible stolen school bus.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.751
[suspenseful music]

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.568
The bus is refusing to stop,
driving with no lights on.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.972
And it looks to be like
he's a young white male,

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.707
possibly 16 years old.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:45.578
And myself and other deputies,
we're in pursuit of him.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:48.381
[sirens]

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.532
K9 2 to all units, if he runs
on foot, do not pursue him.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.376
He's driving real
erratic and turning

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.211
his wheel left and
right on purpose,

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.312
and he's all over the road.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.357
I can't see any
kids on the bus.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.325
It looks like it's just him.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:10.330
[sirens]

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.930
Clear.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:29.582
Watch out.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.450
Uh-oh.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.684
[crash]

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.957
Well, here we go.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.058
[police radio chatter]

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:39.959
[inaudible] Come on!

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.427
Come on!

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.829
Let me see your [muted] hands!

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.302
Let me see your hands now!

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.770
Let me see your hands!

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.738
Let me see your hands!

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.239
Let me see your hands!

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.707
[interposing voices]

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.075
Let me see your hands!

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.049
Shut up!

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.519
[barking]

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.255
The bus door was locked,
and the other deputies grabbed

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.558
the driver of the vehicle
from the driver-side

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.861
window and were able to put him
in handcuffs and pull him out.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.935
[inaudible] flashlight.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:35.381
All right, since you can't--
he can't answer my questions,

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.051
so I have to take him.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.587
It appeared that the
driver of the vehicle

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:44.791
was either trying to flip it
or trying to run one of us

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:45.892
off the road.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.061
He's going to be
charged with evading.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.562
We're getting one of
the local agencies

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.998
to check out if the
bus is in fact stolen.

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:53.866
And also he'll be charged
with multiple counts

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:56.603
of aggravated assault
on public servants.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.171
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:07.647
It was one to put
down for the books

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:11.017
Got a GMC SUV right here.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:14.220
Driver doesn't have
his seat belt on.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.222
I'm gonna get him to
stop and talk to him.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.824
Doesn't look too happy that
we got him pulled over.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.832
[inaudible] that stop sign.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.473
It's got to be on while
you're riding down the road, OK?

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.073
I'm sorry.

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:44.517
835-- 835 [muted].

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:51.924
[suspenseful music]

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:56.429
They're running.

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:02.602
[sirens]

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:11.477
All right, so we tried to
get this guy stopped and IDed,

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.246
but he took off from us.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.614
[police radio chatter]

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.129
We are taking a ride
on 33rd Avenue north.

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:50.817
So this individual's showing
outstanding felony warrants

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.986
regarding to failure
to appear on possession

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:55.088
of controlled substance.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.323
He has no bond, which
explains why he ran.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.328
Hey, check that over
there to the left.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.337
Turning right on 31.

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:46.105
Going Southbound.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:56.616
[police radio chatter]

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:57.583
Hands!

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:08.294
Look out!
Look out!

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:08.895
Look out!

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:15.835
Hey.

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:24.343
All right, we're still 31 South.

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:27.647
Looks like he lost a left tire.

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:30.483
He's going left right
here on 30th Way.

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.495
Guys, left, right, then left.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.937
[sirens]

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:13.459
[panting]

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:14.160
Where'd he go?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.127
Straight ahead.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:15.828
Huh?

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:16.762
Straight ahead.

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.764
[panting]

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:22.735
Straight ahead!

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.569
Ow!

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:25.171
Here.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:25.872
That right there.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.341

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:28.941

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.413
[sirens]

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:35.281
Hey, y'all stay in this area.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.418
Yeah, that's his house.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:45.258
[dramatic music]

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:51.197
This is Jefferson
County Sheriff's Office.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.499
We are not going anywhere.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:56.869
Your best bet is to
surrender and bring yourself

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.739
outside to end it peacefully.

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.007
- Show me your hands.
- Hands!

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.008

Drop down.

Just drop down.
[interposing voices]

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.079
- All right.
- OK.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:07.914
All right, hey.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:08.781
Just drop down.

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:10.149
I'm putting my weapon up.

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:10.983
I'm putting my weapon up.

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:11.651
Just come down to me.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:13.519
We promise you.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.320
We promise you.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.921
Come on down.

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:18.891
- Come on.
- Ain't nobody gonna do nothing.

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:19.992
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.394
Come on.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.630
Hey, we got to see your hands at
all times, so work to the edge.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.464
OK.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.266
And come down to this ladder.

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:27.967
Help.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:31.003
[inaudible]

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.004
Come on.

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:33.072
Grab my shoulder.
- Here hands down.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:33.839
Grab my shoulder

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.774
[inaudible] my hands up.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:35.841
Don't-- don't spit on me.
Come on.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:36.742
OK.
OK.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.910
- Come on.
- I need some water.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.611
That's fine.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:39.912
Give me another leg.

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:40.846
You're spitting on me, dude.

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:41.547
I'm sorry.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.648
I'm-- just sweat.

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:43.449
You're spitting on me.

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:44.216
Control that.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.585
OK.

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:47.853
Here, step down to the ladder.

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:48.621
OK--

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:49.588
Step down to the ladder.

00:09:49.588 --> 00:09:50.289
We got you, buddy.

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:51.090
Come on.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.692
You're two feet away.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.226
All right.

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:55.861
Put your hands
behind your back.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.296
See how easy that was?

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:05.404
[coughing] So just
over this hill right

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.406
here is where my vehicle is.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.275
That's where I gave chase.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.443
I took a couple stumble--

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.578
tumbles and lost sight of him.

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:16.215
He actually made it to his
address, got inside the attic.

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:20.152
The license plate on the vehicle
is attached to this address.

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.188
His ID is attached
to this address.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.357
The dog actually
led to this address

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:26.392
as well, where deputies
were already waiting.

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.627
He surrendered, and he
was taken into custody

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:29.996
with no further incident.

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.230
So all in all, good.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.631
Nobody's hurt.

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:35.434
There's a few vehicles that are
damaged, but he's in custody.

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.470
He's going to face his warrants
and other multiple charges.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:44.510
One of our officers--

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.211
[barking]

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:45.978
--made a traffic stop.

[non-english dog command].

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:51.250
I guess-- it sounds like he was
already talking to the driver

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.351
and got his information.

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:56.689
And while the officer
was back at his car,

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:57.556
the driver took off.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.425
[sirens]

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:00.760
[non-english dog command].

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.360
Good boy.

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:08.768
I'm coming around.

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:12.338
What's the vehicle description?

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:14.607
[suspenseful music]

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:31.924
[inaudible] there's a guy
in a minivan chasing this guy.

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:32.958
Tell him to get out of the way.

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.327
[barking]

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:39.832
K9's lead car.

northbound [inaudible]..

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:09.662
[police radio chatter]

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.565
We hope that he gives
up easily, but we'll see.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:18.504
[police radio chatter]

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.009
Guys, he's reaching
underneath the seat.

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:30.149
Eastbound 300 and [inaudible].

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:34.120
Speeds have lightened up here.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.021
[police radio chatter]

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:43.929
He's reaching down again.

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:44.930
Still reaching under his seat.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.270
We're a pretty good
distance outside of Lawrence.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.241
Actually, we're a
county out right now.

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:56.775
It's not like you
get out of Lawrence

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:58.277
and you're on home base.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.212
Once you cross out
of Lawrence, we

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.615
will continue to
chase you as long

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.951
as the supervisors allow it.

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:13.492
OK.

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:14.160
How far is that?

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:23.669
All right, he just
crashed out onto the field.

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.740
Crash out into a field.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.580
At the roundabout.

Get on the round right now!

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.249
On the ground!

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:38.517
On the ground right now!

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:40.019
On your face right now!

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.153

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:57.036
Put your arms out right now!

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:57.903
Arms out!

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.744
Watch the car, Thomas,
just in case, bud.

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:06.612
Good boy, bubba.

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:07.313
Good boy.

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:08.013
Watch him.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.583
Good boy.

[inaudible]

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:16.088
Woo-hoo!

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:28.867
[police radio chatter]

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:29.835
Subject in custody.

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:33.539
100 and [inaudible].

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.808
Yeah, you're sorry now.

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:36.408
What happened?

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:43.482
Yeah, you know how many
people you could have killed?

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:44.850
It was just--

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.588
Over a stupid warrant, you could
have killed multiple people.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.090
You got anything on you?

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.491
Anything in the car?

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:53.692
No--

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:54.994
What are you throwing
under the seat?

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:56.662
What were your
reaching for, man?

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:57.263
What's in the car?

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.535
What was his warrants for?

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:04.703
Possession of cocaine.

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:07.039
OK.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:11.143
So basically he had some
felony warrants, and--

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:13.445
which Officer Wise
and Officer Anderson,

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.514
when they pulled him over,
they went back to run him.

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:16.215
And he took off.

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:16.815
So--

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.687
You might look underneath
there again on that side.

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:22.921
I can't tell.

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.290
Hey, we're not worried
about your phone and wallet

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.357
right now, OK?

00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:26.558
You know how many lives
you put in danger?

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.094
So many!

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.431
That was dumb.

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:38.804
[sirens]

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.272
[suspenseful]

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:43.309
So what we're
going to is a person

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.011
that had their car
stolen is actually

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.813
following their stolen car.

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:50.215
They're going to be
coming up to us right now.

00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:54.520
It's going to be a
gray Dodge Durango.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.621
OK, that's it right there.

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.993
Continuing about
45 miles an hour,

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.662
no traffic, coming
up to North First.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.436
Coming up to North
First, no traffic, 45.

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:12.838
Right on North
First, left on Rodeo.

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:17.309
Right on Curtis.

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.544
He blew the light.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.579
Still about 45,
50 miles an hour.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:21.914
I'm trying to catch up.

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:24.583
Coming up to Linwood, about 66.

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.852
Made a right turn on
Linwood, blew the stop sign.

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:29.488
And he crashed.

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:33.492
[police radio chatter]

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.595
I got the driver running
toward the school.

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.831
Lock down the school.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.566
Coming driver
running to the school.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.134
Lock down the school.

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.635
[suspenseful music]

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:48.674
Driver's wearing
a blue sweatshirt!

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.376
Going over the fence!

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:53.178
I got a passenger,
black sweatshirt!

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.618
[inaudible] up to the school!

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:00.719
They're going behind the school!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.594
He's going on Tampico!

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:24.676
Did somebody run
inside your house?

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:29.815
I'm with you.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:31.784
Let's go.

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:32.384
Let's go.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.131

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:57.309
Let him come out.

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:58.110
Let him come out.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.144
- Crawl out!
- Crawl out!

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.112
- Crawl out!
- We got him in the back.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:00.813
Crawl out!

00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:01.513
Hold on.

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:02.581
Crawl out.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.682
- I got a Taser.
- Get on the ground.

00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:04.650
- I got a Taser.
- Get on the ground.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.350
I got him.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.151
I got a Taser.

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.119
Do not move.
Hands out.

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.187
- Hands out.
- Get your hands out.

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:09.421
- Let me see your hands!

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.122
Yeah.

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:11.356
I got him, Abel.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:12.691
Nice and easy.
He's not going anywhere.

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:13.625
Do not move.
You understand?

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:14.626
Put your hands
behind your back.

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.595
Put your hands behind
your back, now.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.797
Put that hand
behind your back.

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:20.199
Yeah, see that?

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.167
It's easy, isn't it?

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:22.868
Get up.

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:23.569
Stand up.

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:24.636
Get up.

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.305
[inaudible],, we're
code four over here.

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:27.506
- Stand up.
- Donnie, are you code four over

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:29.675
there?

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:30.375
No.

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:31.076
Take him out.

00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:33.145
Copy.

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.079
So he's in custody.

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.747
The passenger is in custody.

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:37.449
Nobody's hurt.

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:38.917
So now we're just going
to figure all this out.

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:44.122
OK, did he tell you anything?

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:45.257
Nothing.

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:48.093
He just told me, can I
have a glass of water?

00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:49.795
And I goes, who are you?

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.629
What do you want?

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:53.932
Why are you inside of my house?

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:57.236
So obviously they bottomed
out and then ended up here.

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:59.304
And then the passenger
in the black sweatshirt

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:01.640
was going that way, and then
the driver went that way.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.209
So we went and stayed right
there with the driver,

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:06.578
and Officer Hart stayed
with the passenger.

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.013
Hi, I'm the vehicle owner.
My name's Brent.

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:09.114
Hey, Brent.
I'm Jacky.

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:10.883
I have a copy of my
police report here.

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.251
- They got it good, huh?
- Yeah, they did.

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.385
I'm sorry.

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:14.453
But that's what we got
insurance for, though.

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:15.821
That's true.

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.790
So the driver's going to be
arrested for a stolen vehicle,

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.427
evading police, obstructing
us by hiding from us

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:25.330
and going in the house, and
also burglary because he entered

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.332
her house without permission.

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.201
The passenger, he's a juvenile.

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:32.037
There's alcohol in the car, so
we're taking him to the station

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:34.473
for further investigation.
