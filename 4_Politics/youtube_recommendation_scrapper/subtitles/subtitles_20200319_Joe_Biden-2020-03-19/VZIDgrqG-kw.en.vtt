NEED A BAND ON "THE VIEW."

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:33.298 align:start position:0%

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:37.470 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ONLY A GOOD ONE.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:38.604 align:start position:0%

BEING BACK.

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:39.805 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:42.675
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WE ENJOYED HAVING
YOU LAST TIME, BUT THIS IS THE

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:46.646
FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER
SINCE YOUR FATHER PASSED AWAY.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.482
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND I JUST WANT TO
SAY I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS AND

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:50.683 align:start position:0%
THE LOSS OF OUR NATION.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.752 align:start position:0%
HE WAS A GREAT MAN.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:56.389 align:start position:0%
YOU SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY AT HIS
FUNERAL.

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:56.723 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:01:00.193 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.761 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU, SINCERELY.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:02.995 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.766
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN YOU GAVE HIS
EULOGY, YOU SAID WE GATHER HERE

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.268
TO MOURN THE PASSING OF AMERICAN
GREATNESS, THE REAL THING, NOT

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:12.905
CHEAP RHETORIC FROM MEN WHO WILL
NEVER COME NEAR THE SACRIFICE HE

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:14.907 align:start position:0%
GAVE SO WILLINGLY.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start position:0%
DO YOU --
&gt;&gt; I DID SAY THAT.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:19.278
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU DID SAY THAT.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:20.112 align:start position:0%
AND I MEAN IT.

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:22.648 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT WAS SOMEWHAT
POINTED.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.916 size:81% position:41%
THAT WAS SOMEWHAT POINTED.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:28.721
I HAVE TO ASK, DID YOU KNOW THAT
JARED AND IVANKA TRUMP WOULD BE

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.290
ATTENDING WHEN YOU WROTE THIS?

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:35.628 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I -- THE NATURE OF MY
FATHER'S CANCER, I HAD THE

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:40.266
LUXURY AND CURSE THAT I WAS
WRITING IT IN REALTIME, AND I

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.202 align:start position:0%
OBVIOUSLY KNEW WITH HIS
DIAGNOSIS THAT HE WOULD MORE

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:47.006
THAN LIKELY DIE WITHIN A YEAR.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.576
SOUTH WEIRD TO WRITE A EULOGY
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S STILL ALIVE.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.679
BUT WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON IT,
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT WHO WOULD

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:56.682 align:start position:0%
BE ATTENDING THE FUNERAL,
STRANGELY, AND THE ANSWER IS,

00:01:56.715 --> 00:02:01.854
NO, I DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY
WOULD BE ATTENDING HIS FUNERAL.

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:03.456 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT LIKE
FOR YOU?

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.458
&gt;&gt; IT'S WEIRD TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.426
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF YOU DON'T MIND.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.594 align:start position:0%
OF COURSE.

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:12.598 align:start position:0%
A FUNERAL IS OBVIOUSLY A SACRED
TIME AND I THOUGHT THAT MY

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:17.103
FAMILY HAD MADE IT CLEAR, OR AT
LEAST I HAD, THAT THE TRUMPS ARE

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:20.239
UNWELCOME AROUND ME AND THAT MY
FATHER HAD BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THE

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:24.310
LINE BETWEEN THE McCAINS AND
THE TRUMPS, SO I WAS SURPRISED

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:27.880 size:88% position:44%
WHEN THEY WERE THERE, AND IT
MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:32.652 align:start position:0%
HOPE I MADE THEM UNCOMFORTABLE,
HONESTLY, WITH EVERYTHING.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:37.490 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE --

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.760
IT'S A WEIRD THING TO EVEN TALK
ABOUT ON A LATE-NIGHT SHOW, BUT

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.930
I ALSO KNOW THAT MY FATHER WAS
ALWAYS, IF NOTHING, A HAM, AND

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:48.501
HE DESIGNED HIS FUNERAL TO SORT
OF BE BRIDGING FOR AMERICA AND

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.436 align:start position:0%
TO BE HEALING.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.807 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, AS AN
EXAMPLE, HIS SERVICE AS AN

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.178 align:start position:0%
EXAMPLE AND HIS BIPARTISANSHIP
AS AN EXAMPLE, NOT THAT HE

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:01.280
DIDN'T HAVE VERY CONSERVATIVE
POLICIES, NOT THAT HE ALWAYS

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.950 align:start position:0%
AGREED WITH THE PEOPLE ACROSS
THE AISLE BUT HE DID NOT SEE THE

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:07.353 align:start position:0%
OTHER SIDE AS A MORTAL ENEMY OR
EVIL.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:08.955
&gt;&gt; NO, AND BOTH CANDIDATES WHO
BEAT HIM FOR PRESIDENT SPOKE,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:12.625
AND IT'S THE HONOR OF MY LIFE
THAT I WAS ABLE TO GIVE THAT,

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.193 align:start position:0%
IT'S SUCH A HAZE.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:20.766
I REALLY WANT IT MADE VERY CLEAR
THAT YOU HAVE -- THE TRUMPS HAVE

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.770
BEEF WITH ME THEN AND IN THE
WORDS OF CARDI B THEY'RE GOING

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:28.474
TO HAVE BEEF WITH ME FOREVER,
AND I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.443 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S SORT OF A STRANGE ELEMENT

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:34.614 align:start position:0%
TO MY LIFE NOW THAT THEY
ATTENDED, AND I WISH THEY HAD

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.917
CHOSEN NOT TO OUT OF RESPECT, IF
NOTHING MORE, FOR ME, BUT IT'S

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.287
THEIR CALL, AND I THINK AMERICA
CAN JUDGE ON ITS OWN WHAT THEY

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.058 align:start position:0%
THOUGHT OF THAT AND WHAT THEY
THOUGHT OF MY EULOGY.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.294 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.596 align:start position:0%
IT'S HARD, YOU KNOW.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.131
IT'S A HARD THING TO TALK ABOUT.

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:54.433 size:75% position:38%
MY FATHER WAS TO PUBLIC.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:59.338 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOT A SHRINKING
VIOLET, YOUR FATHER.

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:01.274 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO, AND HE LOVED ATTENTION
AND CAMERAS.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:04.176
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND WE WERE LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM ON HERE, BUT HE

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.212 align:start position:0%
ACTUALLY TOLD YOU SHOULD DO "THE
VIEW."

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE DID.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.348
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE I
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THE TYPE OF

00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:14.053
SHOW I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON AND
HAD SUCH A CAROUSEL OF HOSTS

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:14.854 align:start position:0%
ROTATING IN AND OUT.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.056 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT CHANGED YOUR
MIND?

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.257 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HE INSISTED.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.994
HE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AND HE
INSISTED AND HE SAID YOU CANNOT

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:25.431
NOT WORK WITH WHOOPI GOLDBERG.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:29.502 align:start position:0%
THEY HAD THIS AFFECTION FOR ONE
ANOTHER.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:34.874
I KNEW THEY WERE FRIENDS --
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WAS THIS A FATHER

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.410 align:start position:0%
AND SISTER ACT?

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.210 align:start position:0%
WHEN?

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:41.580
&gt;&gt; WORKING ON HIV/AIDS ACTIVISM.

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:44.116
SHE'S SUCH AN INCREDIBLE PERSON
AND I CONSIDER HER FAMILY AT

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.952 align:start position:0%
THIS POINT AND I THINK HE KNEW
THINGS I DIDN'T ABOUT BEING

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:52.191
AROUND HERE, BUT IT'S SUCH AN
INCREDIBLE PLATFORM TO BE ON

00:04:52.224 --> 00:04:53.425 align:start position:0%
EVERY DAY.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:05:00.132 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU SAID YOU WANT
HER TO BE THE JANE GO GOODALL OF

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:02.501 align:start position:0%
RED AMERICA AND EXPLAIN MY
PEOPLE.

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:05.338
&gt;&gt; YES, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO SHOW NOT ALL WOMEN WHO WORK

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:10.509
ON NEWS AND DAYTIME TV -- I'M
PRO-LIFE, PRO GUY AND A FOREIGN

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:15.147 align:start position:0%
POLICY HAWK AND THAT'S AN
IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE TO SHOW ON

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.983 align:start position:0%
TELEVISION, BUT I AM A STRANGE
PERSON IN THE PARTY NOW.

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:22.154 align:start position:0%
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I ARE -- OUR
CONSERVATIVE VALUES DIDN'T

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:23.288 align:start position:0%
CHANGE.

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
I DIDN'T BECOME A TRUMP POPULIST
BUT ALSO DIDN'T BECOME A

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:28.561 align:start position:0%
LIBERAL.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.529 align:start position:0%
IT'S AN INTERESTING TIME TO BE
IN POLITICS.

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:32.498 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU STILL FEEL
LIKE A REPUBLICAN?

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:36.602
&gt;&gt; I'M IN THE PARTY AND VOTE
LOCALLY ON THE TICKET, BUT I'M

00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:38.170 align:start position:0%
MORE CONSERVATIVE.

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:39.404 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LOCALLY?

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:42.141 align:start position:0%
IN H-H- I VOTE FOR CANDIDATES
NORMALLY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:44.610 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ANYBODY YOU LIKE
IN 2020?

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:46.746 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ON THE REPUBLICAN OR THE
DEMOCRAT SIDE?

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ANYBODY.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:52.151 size:88% position:44%
I AM VERY CURIOUS TO SEE IF
JOE BIDEN GETS INTO THE RACE

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:58.924 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE I LOVE HIM ON A PERSONAL
LEVEL AND I THINK IT WILL BE

00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:00.926 align:start position:0%
INTERESTING TO SEE IF HE CAN
PULL IT OFF.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:06.332
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HE'S IN HIS
70s BUT HE'S SUCH A BELOVED

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:07.633 align:start position:0%
AMERICAN FIGURE AND, ON A
PERSONAL LEVEL, THE

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:10.836
JUXTAPOSITION IN MY EXPERIENCE
WITH CANCER AND THE TRUMPS AND

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:15.775 align:start position:0%
THE BIDENS HAS BEEN THE I DIDN'T
THINK TO THE I CAN YANG.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:16.909 align:start position:0%
HE WAS THERE FOR ME AND MY
FAMILY.

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:23.716 align:start position:0%
HIS SON DIED OF THE CANCER MY
FATHER HAD, GLIOBLASTOMA.

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.653
IF HE BECOMES THE NOMINEE I WILL
HAVE TO QUIT TELEVISION BECAUSE

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:30.723 align:start position:0%
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT
HIM.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:31.924 align:start position:0%
I TOLD HIM THAT.

00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:36.228
MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR
THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE ME ON THE

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:36.762 align:start position:0%
