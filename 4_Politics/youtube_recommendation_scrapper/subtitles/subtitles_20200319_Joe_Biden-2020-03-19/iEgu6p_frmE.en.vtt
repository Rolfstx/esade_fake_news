00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.680
He was the single most successful investor of the 20th century.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.500
Time Magazine named him one of the most influential people in the world.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.120
He's worth over 70 billion dollars.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.960
He's Warren Buffett, and here are his top 10 rules for success.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.020
How can other people... tap dance to work, what's the secret of that?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.020
You find your passion, you find your passion.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.320
I was very, very lucky to find ....

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.000
you know what? I was ...

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.800
Seven or eight years old and, you know

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.200
and fortunately my children have found their passion.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800
My, you know, one son loves farming like nothing else.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.000
One son loves music like everything else.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.400
And all three of them love philanthropy and what they get to do.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.020
You're lucky in life when you find it, and uh–

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.580
you can't guarantee you're gonna find it in your first job

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.680
but I always tell the college students to come out

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.680
I say, "Take the job that you would take if you would take if

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.800
you were independently wealthy."

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.700
You know, that's, you're going to do well at it.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.720
If you think you're going to be a lot happier if you've got 2x instead of x, you're probably making a mistake.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.400
I mean ... You oughta find something you like that's– that works with that

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.980
I am pagle abbas is good and also hassan is good and iam pagle

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600
Because then you will do things like borrow money when you shouldn't

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.000
... or maybe cut corners on things that your employer wants you to cut corners on.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.700
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.000
You won't like it when you look back on it...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.500
The three things in hiring to people you look for are integrity, intelligence and energy

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.400
and he said, "If the person didn't have the first two, that the latter two would kill him"

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.400
because if they don't have integrity, you want 'em dumb and lazy. You don't want 'em smart and energetic.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.000
It never bothered me, if people...

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.100
disagreed with what I thought,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.680
as long as I felt I knew the facts.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.100
I mean there's a whole bunch of things that I don't know a thing about.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.100
I just stay away from those.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.000
So, I stay within what I call my circle of competence.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.800
Tom Watson said it best.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.800
He said, "I'm no genius but I'm smart in spots and I stay around those spots."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.160
Well, I try and stay around those spots ...

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.100
and I just don't have a problem if

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200
somebody says you know you are wrong on something.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.700
I just go back and look at the facts...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.700
and I think that really is much more important, frankly,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.000
than– than having a few more points of IQ or...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.940
or having an extra course or two in school or anything of the sort.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.420
You need emotional stability.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.120
I just read and read and read. I probably read five to six hours a day.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.740
I don't read as fast now as when I was younger

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.580
but I read five daily newspaper. I read a fair number of magazines.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.400
I read 10-Ks, I read annual reports and I read a lot of other things too.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.000
So I've always enjoyed reading, I love reading biographies.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Famous lesson about a margin of safety ...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
you don't drive a truck

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that weighs 99-hundred pounds across a bridge

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that says limit 10-thousand pounds

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because you can't be that sure about it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If you see something like that, go a down

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
further down the road and go by one that says,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
"limit 20,000 pounds" .. and that's the one you drive across

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The nature of capitalism is  that people want to come and take your castle.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Perfectly understandable.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I mean, if I'm selling television sets or something

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
there's going to be ten other people trying to sell a better television set.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If I have a restaurant here in Omaha,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
people are gonna try and copy my menu

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and give more parking and take my chef, and so on ...

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So, capitalism's all about

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
somebody coming and trying to take the castle.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Now, what you need

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is you need a castle that has some durable ...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
competitive advantage ...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.120
Some castle that has a moat around it.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.000
And that moat, that's one of the best moats, in many respects

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is to be a low-cost producer.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But sometimes the moat is just having more talent.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I mean, if you're the heavyweight champion of the world

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and you keep knocking out people, you've got

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
a competitive advantage as long as you can keep doing it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And it's very profitable

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
if you're the one that happens to be able to do it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If you can turn out great motion pictures ...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Steven Spielberg ...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I mean, he's a fellow to bet on

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and it has enormous economic value.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You'd be surprised

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
at– at my days

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I mean, they are very

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
unstructured

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Uh ... no meetings

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
uh ... none

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I mean ... we don't ... I don't like meetings

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and, uh ...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I read a lot

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I wish I were a faster reader.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'd get more done. But I do read a lot.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.040
And I– I, uh... I'm on the phone

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.000
a moderate amount.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Uh...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Our businesses run themselves, basically, out there.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
My job is allocating capital

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and that's what I'm thinking about.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But I don't like to have

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
things all packed hour to hour to hour

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and Bill and I are both

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
extraordinarily lucky ... I mean, we really get to do

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
what we like to do the way we wanna do it

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
with the people that we choose to be around that are terrific.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.900
I mean, we've really got everything

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.000
our way

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and we're very fortunate.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.280
And ... in his world, he has some...

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.000
he has a different kind of pace than I have

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but we both love it the way we do it

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
my guess is that we're each

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.260
the most productive

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.560
in that particular mode, too

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.920
because it ...

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
it fits our personalities and aptitudes.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.760
What kills great businesses

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.000
If you look at... I do believe in looking at history

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and I–

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I try to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I like to study failure, actually ... my partner says

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
all I wanna know is where I'll die

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
so I'll never go there.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And we want to see what has caused

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
businesses to go bad

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and the biggest thing that kills 'em is complacency.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.400
You want a restlessness

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.000
a feeling that

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
you know, that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
somebody's always after you

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but you're gonna stay ahead of them

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
you always want to be on the move.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And, uh...

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
when you've got a great business

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
you know, like Coca Cola, which is ...

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
there aren't any like Coca Cola.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But you really...

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
the danger would always be

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that you rest on your morals

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but I see none of that in Coca Cola

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that is the key:

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to compete the same way when you've got

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
1.8 billion servings being sold daily

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
as when you were selling

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
ten a day

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that restlessness, that belief

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that tomorrow's more exciting

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
than today.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
You know, you just have to have it permeate the organizations.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Who was Ben Graham ...?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
He was your primary mentor, model ...

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
He was a wonderful man

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and he was my professor at Columbia

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I read his book when I was 19

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.440
at the University of Nebraska.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.000
And I'd started investing when I was eleven

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and I started reading about him when I was like seven.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So, I had gone through all ...

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I'd read every book in the Omaha Public Library that there was on...,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.320
by the time I was twelve, on investing and stock market.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.000
And I had a lot of fun,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
but I never really found out...

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I never got grounded in anything

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and it was entertaining

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but it wasn't gonna be profitable.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And then I read Graham's book

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The Intelligent Investor

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.200
when I was at University of Nebraska

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.440
and that just opened the whole thing up to me.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.000
And I named my oldest son
