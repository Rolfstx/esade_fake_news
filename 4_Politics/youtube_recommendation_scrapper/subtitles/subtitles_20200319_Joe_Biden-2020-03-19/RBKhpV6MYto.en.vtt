00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.180
Ezra Klein: So let’s begin with the economy.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.459
We're in a point where the economy is growing.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:09.360
We have very high corporate profits.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.940
We have a record stock market, and yet for
decades now we've not been seeing significant

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.870
wage increases for the American people.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.220
How have we gotten to a point where we can
have high corporate profits, and businesses

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.410
can be doing so well, but the workers don't
necessarily share in that prosperity?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.750
Barack Obama: Well, this has been at least
a three-decade-long trend.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.910
And this was a major topic in my State of
the Union address.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.050
We obviously came in at a time of enormous
crisis, and the first task was making sure

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.649
we didn't have a complete global economic
meltdown.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.390
The steps we took, whether making sure the
financial system was functioning — saving

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.140
the auto industry, encouraging state and local
spending.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.820
All those things made a difference in buoying
the economy, and then it’s been a hard but

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.170
steady slog to the point where now we're growing
at a robust pace and unemployment has come

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.350
down faster than any time in the last 30 years.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.590
In some ways we're now back to the position
where we can focus on what is this longer-term

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.750
trend, and that is a larger and larger share
of wealth and income going to the very top,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.580
and the middle class or folks trying to get
into the middle class, feeling increasingly

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.550
squeezed because their wages have stagnated.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.070
Now, there are a whole bunch of reasons for
that.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.900
Some of it has to do with technology and entire
job sectors being eliminated: travel agents,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.980
bank tellers, a lot of middle management,
because of efficiencies with the internet

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.090
and a paperless office.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.780
A lot of it has to do with globalization and
the rest of the world catching up.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.050
Post-World War II, we just had some enormous
structural advantages because our competitors

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.470
had been devastated by war, and we had also
made investments that put us ahead of the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.140
curve, whether in education or infrastructure
or research and development.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:15.960
And around the ‘70s and ‘80s and then
accelerating beyond that, those advantages

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.680
went away at the same time as, because of
technologies, companies are getting a lot

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.090
more efficient and one last component of this
is that workers increasingly had less leverage

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.380
because of changes in labor laws and the ability
for capital to move and labor not to move.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.160
&nbsp;You combine all that stuff and it’s put
workers in a tougher position.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:49.620
So our job now is to create additional tools
that, number one, make sure that everybody's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.960
got a baseline of support to be able to succeed
in a constantly moving economy.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.510
Whether it’s healthcare that survives job
loss, whether it is making sure we have child

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:10.840
care that allows a two-working-household-family
to prosper while still caring for their kids.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.180
Having a certain baseline in terms of wages,
through the minimum wage.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.180
So that's one set of issues.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.180
A second set of issues then becomes: how do
we make sure that everybody has the tools

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.740
to succeed in an economy where they constantly
have to adapt?

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.850
And how do they move up the value chain, essentially
because they can work in higher-wage, higher-skill

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.410
professions, and were able to compete for
those jobs internationally?

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.290
Then the third thing is making sure that we
have an economy that's productive.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.630
Now if we do all those things, then what I'm
confident about is that we can continue to

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.620
lower the unemployment rate, increase the
participation rate, and continue to grow and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.819
increase productivity.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.900
We're still going to have a broader, longer
term, global question and that is: how do

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.520
we make sure that the folks at the very top
are doing enough of their fair share?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:13.690
The winner-take-all aspect of this modern
economy means that you've got some people

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.389
who just control enormous amounts of wealth.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.220
We don't really resent their success, on the
other hand just as a practical matter, if

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.260
we're going to pay for schools, roads, et
cetera, and you've got you know, fifty people

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.690
or eighty people having as much wealth as
three billion, you know you're going to have

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.010
problems making sure that we're investing
enough in the common good to be able to move

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.010
forward.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.100
&nbsp;So that's a long term question.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.870
&nbsp;But right now, there's some very specific
things we can do that can makes a difference

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.810
and help middle class families.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.850
And that's why I called it middle-class economics.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.850
&nbsp;

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.180
Ezra: To focus a bit on that long term question,
does that put us in a place long term where

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.250
redistribution becomes, in a sense, a positive
good in and of itself, that you have an economy

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.440
or potentially you have the government playing
the role not of powering the growth engine

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.650
which is what a lot of what had to be done
after the financial crisis, but of making

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.240
sure that while that growth engine is running,
that it is ensuring that enough of the gains

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.930
and prosperity is shared that the political
support for that fundamental economic model

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.130
to remain strong?

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.270
Obama: That's always been the case.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.850
I don't think that's entirely new.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.340
The fact of the matter is that relative to
our post-war history, taxes now are not particularly

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.830
high or particularly progressive compared
to what they were, say, in the late ‘50s

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.830
or the ‘60s.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.860
And there's always been this notion that for
a country to thrive, there are some things,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.910
as Lincoln says, that we can do better together
than we can do for ourselves.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.650
And whether that's building roads, or setting
up effective power grids, or making sure that

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.830
we've got high quality public education, that
teachers are paid enough, the market will

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.020
not cover those things.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.199
And we've got to do them together.

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.700
Basic research falls in that category.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.350
So that's always been true.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.260
I think that part of what's changed is that
a lot of that burden for making sure that

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.320
the pie was broadly shared took place before
government even got involved.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.820
If you had stronger unions, you had higher
wages.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:23.370
If you had a corporate culture that felt a
sense of place and commitment so that the

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:33.400
CEO was in Pittsburgh or was in Detroit and
felt obliged, partly because of social pressure

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.460
but partly because they felt a real affinity
toward the community, to re-invest in that

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.190
community and to be seen as a good corporate
citizen.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:49.040
&nbsp;Today what you have is quarterly earning
reports, compensation levels for CEOs that

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:58.449
are tied directly to those quarterly earnings,
you've got international capital that is demanding

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.990
maximizing short term profits.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:11.110
And so what happens is that a lot of the distributional
questions that used to be handled in the marketplace

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:19.110
through decent wages or health care or defined
benefit pension plans, those things all are

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.460
eliminated.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.510
And the average employee, the average worker,
doesn't feel any benefit.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.060
So part of our job is what can government
do directly through tax policy?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.510
What we’ve proposed, for example, in terms
of capital gains.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.350
That would make a big difference in our capacity
to give a tax break to a working mom for child

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.350
care.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:46.830
And that's smart policy, and there's no evidence
that would hurt the incentives of folks at

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.710
Google or Microsoft or Uber not to invent
what they invent or not to provide services

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.710
they provide.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:02.199
It just means that instead of 20 billion dollars,
maybe they've got 18.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.199
Right?

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:08.580
&nbsp;But it does mean that mom can go to work
without worrying that her kid's not in a safe

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.110
place.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.110
&nbsp;

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.670
We also still have to focus on the front end.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:21.000
Which is even before taxes are paid, are there
ways that we can increase the bargaining power

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.690
and the -- making sure that an employee has
some ... measurable increases in their incomes

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.820
and their wealth and their security as a consequence
of an economy that's improving.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:42.959
&nbsp;And that's where issues like labor laws
make a difference, that's where, say in shareholder

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:50.829
meetings,and trying to change the culture
in terms of compensation at the corporate

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:51.829
level.

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:52.829
Those things could make a difference.

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:57.920
And there's been some interesting conversations
globally around issues like inclusive capitalism

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.009
and how we can make it work for everybody.

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:04.480
Ezra: When you drill into that pretax portion,
one thing you can find in wages is health

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480
care costs.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480
Obama: Yeah.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.939
Ezra: And when you drill deeper into the health
care costs, one thing you find is that a major

00:09:10.939 --> 00:09:16.459
piece of why Americans pay so much more is
that when we go to a hospital, an MRI, or

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:22.199
an appendectomy, or even a bottle of cholesterol
drugs, just costs much more for an American

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:25.920
to buy than it does in Germany, in Japan,
in Canada, in Great Britain.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.910
Why do you think Americans pay so much higher
health care prices than folks in other countries?

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.059
Obama: Well, you know there are a lot of theories
about this.

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:38.769
But I think the evidence points to a couple
of key factors.

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:40.779
One is that we've got a third-party system.

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:46.089
Mostly we've got a system where everybody
gets their health insurance through their

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:47.339
employers.

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:52.690
Obviously the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,
helps to cover the gap for those who aren't

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.319
in that system.

00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:59.540
But for those of us who have an insurer, we
don't track it.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:08.839
And the market then becomes really opaque
and really hard to penetrate.

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:17.889
Health providers are able to, I think, charge
without much fear that somebody's looking

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:21.560
over their shoulders and asking well why does
this cost that much?

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.559
So that's part of it.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:29.970
That's one of the reasons the Affordable Care
Act, a lot of the attention’s been on making

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:35.260
sure that the uninsured have peace of mind,
and people who currently have insurance but

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.379
at some point might lose it or have pre-existing
conditions are going to have it, that's obviously

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:45.029
the moral basis for what we did.

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:49.249
But people haven't been paying as much attention
to the delivery system reforms that we're

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:52.339
trying to institute through the Affordable
Care Act as well.

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:57.339
I can't take credit for all four years of
the lowest health care inflation in the last

00:10:57.339 --> 00:11:01.209
fifty, that we've seen since the Affordable
Care Act passed.

00:11:01.209 --> 00:11:05.059
Some of the trends I think were already on
their way.

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:10.600
But we are accelerating a lot of reforms,
for example.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:17.619
What do we do to make sure that instead of
paying a doctor of a hospital for just providing

00:11:17.619 --> 00:11:22.509
a service, let’s make sure that they're
being rewarded for a good outcome?

00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:30.230
Which may mean in some cases fewer tests or
a less expensive generic drug, or just making

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.910
sure that all your employees are washing your
hands so that you're cutting the infection

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:41.999
rate, or making sure that hospitals are reimbursed
when there's a lower readmissions rate, as

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:44.410
opposed to when they're doing more stuff.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:53.799
And using Medicare as a lever, I think, is
creating an environment in the health care

00:11:53.799 --> 00:12:05.209
field where we can start getting better outcomes
and lower costs at the same time.

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:12.350
There are still going to be those who argue
that unless you get a single-payer system,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.819
you're never going to get all the efficiencies.

00:12:14.819 --> 00:12:22.100
There's certain areas like drugs where the
fact that Congress has not been, and the Republican

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:30.009
Party in particular, has been resistant to
letting drug makers and Medicare negotiate

00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:32.279
for the lowest price.

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:39.220
It results in us paying a lot more than we
should.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:45.579
&nbsp;But if we're paying four, five, six, eight
percent more than other countries for the

00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:51.939
same outcomes, I'd be pretty happy where we're
only paying two or three percent more.

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:56.480
Because that represents hundreds of billions
of dollars and means we can do a lot with

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
that money.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.369
Ezra: When you talk about Medicare as a lever,
Medicare tends to pay a lot less per service

00:13:01.369 --> 00:13:04.739
than private insurers by a margin.

00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:09.689
Before single payer there's also this idea
you hear occasionally of letting private insurers

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:14.059
band together with Medicare, with Medicaid,
to jointly negotiate prices.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.470
Do you think that's a good idea?

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:27.750
Obama: You know, I think that moving in the
direction where consumers and others can have

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:34.119
more power in the marketplace, particularly
when it comes to drugs, makes a lot of sense.

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:38.620
&nbsp;Now you'll hear from the drug companies
that part of the reasons other countries pay

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.299
less for drugs is they don't innovate.

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:47.660
We essentially through our system, subsidize
the innovation and other countries are free

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.470
riders.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.309
There's probably a little bit of truth to
that but when you look at the number of breakthrough

00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:58.279
drugs and the amount of money that drug companies
now are putting into research and where they're

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:07.299
putting it, a whole lot of it is actually
in redesigning, modestly, existing drugs so

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:11.579
they can renew patents and maintain higher
prices and higher profits.

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:14.040
That's not entirely true... but there's some
of that.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:20.220
So there is a lot of savings that could be
achieved while still making sure that our

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.569
drug industry is the best in the world, and
will still be making a healthy profit.

00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:29.059
Ezra: To turn a bit towards politics, at this
point according to the polls, you are the

00:14:29.059 --> 00:14:32.679
most polarizing president really since we
began polling, but before you the record was

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:37.249
set by George W. Bush, and before George W.
Bush the record was set by Bill Clinton.

00:14:37.249 --> 00:14:41.309
It seems that there's something structural
happening there in terms party polarization

00:14:41.309 --> 00:14:45.999
and the way it affects approval ratings and
cooperation with presidents.

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:51.359
In your State of the Union you struck back
at critics who say that the idea of healing

00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:55.239
some of these divisions is naïve or impossible.

00:14:55.239 --> 00:15:00.619
So when you welcome your successor into office,
what would you tell them there is worth trying

00:15:00.619 --> 00:15:04.579
to that you think that can still work, that
would reduce the polarization?

00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:11.949
Obama: Well, there are a couple of things
that in my mind, at least, contribute to our

00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:17.449
politics being more polarized than people
actually are.

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:20.709
And I think most people just sense this in
their daily lives.

00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:30.619
Everybody's got a family member or a really
good friend from high school who is on the

00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:34.119
complete opposite side of the political spectrum.

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:36.929
And yet, we still love them, right?

00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:42.639
&nbsp;Everybody goes to a soccer game, or watching
their kids, coaching, and they see parents

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:48.779
who they think are wonderful people and then
if they made a comment about politics suddenly

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:51.509
they'd go, 'I can't believe you think that!'

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:56.879
&nbsp;But a lot of it has to do with the fact
that a) the balkanization of the media means

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:01.899
that we just don't have a common place where
we get common facts and a common world view

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:06.040
the way we did twenty, thirty years ago.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.709
And that just keeps on accelerating, you know,
and I'm not the first to observe this but

00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:15.499
you've got the Fox News Rush Limbaugh folks
and then you've got the MSNBC folks and the

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:21.799
-- I dunno where Vox falls into that, but
you guys are I guess for the brainiac nerd

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:23.869
types.

00:16:23.869 --> 00:16:30.519
But the point is that technology which brings
the world to us also allows us to narrow our

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:31.699
point of view.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.350
That's contributed to it.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.649
Gerrymandering contributes to it.

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:41.160
There's no incentive for most members of congress,
on the House side at least, in congressional

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.499
districts, to even bother trying to appeal.

00:16:43.499 --> 00:16:47.100
And a lot of it has to do with just unlimited
money.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:56.850
So people are absorbing an entirely different
reality when it comes to politics, even though

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:01.329
the way they're living their lives and interacting
with each other isn't that polarizing.

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:12.579
So my advice to a future president is increasingly
try to bypass the traditional venues that

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:21.100
create divisions and try to find new venues
within this new media that are quirkier, less

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.670
predictable.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:29.700
You know yesterday I did three interviews
with YouTube stars that generally don't spend

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.250
a lot of time talking about politics.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:37.300
And the reason we did it is because they're
reaching viewers who don't want to be put

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.990
in some particular camp, on the other hand
when you talk to them very specifically about

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:47.660
college costs or about health care or about
any of the other things that touch on their

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.770
individual lives, it turns out that you can
probably build a pretty good consensus.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:18:02.810
Now that doesn't ignore the fact that I would
love to see some constitutional process that

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:11.080
would allow us to actually regulate campaign
spending the way we used to, and maybe even

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.180
improve it.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:17.850
I'd love to see changes at the state level
that reduce political gerrymandering.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.560
So there's all kinds of structural things
that I'd like to see that I think would improve

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.500
this, but, you know there’ve been periods
in the past where we've been pretty polarized.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.450
I think, there just wasn't polling around.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:33.400
As I recall there was a whole civil war, that
was a good example of polarization that took

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400
place.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.220
Ezra: Do you think if we don't get some of
those structural reforms, and more to the

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:43.610
point if we continue along this path, in terms
of where the parties are in Congress, are

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.480
there ways to govern with polarization?

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.580
It occurs to me that your argument when you
came to office, but before you, Bush was a

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.320
"uniter not a divider" and before him Clinton
who was going to moderate and change the Democratic

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.100
party with his sort of Third Way approach,
the last couple of presidents have come to

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.760
office promising the way they would get things
done is to reduce polarization.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.190
Is there an argument or an approach that can
be made to govern amidst polarization?

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.620
Obama: A couple observations.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:17.410
&nbsp;Number one is that in American history,
even during the so-called golden age where,

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:22.680
you know, you had liberal Republicans and
conservative Democrats and there was deal

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.150
cutting going on in Congress.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:30.620
Generally speaking, big stuff didn't get done
unless there was a major crisis or you had

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:38.230
-- and/or you had big majorities of one party
controlling the Congress and a president of

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.230
the same party.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.620
I mean that's just been the history.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:46.850
There have been exceptions, but that's often
been the case in terms of big muscle movements

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.030
in the political system.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:56.020
And you know, my first two years in office
when I had a Democratic majority and Democratic

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:03.310
house and Democratic Senate, we were as productive
as any time since Lyndon Johnson.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:07.280
And when the majority went away stuff got
blocked.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:15.290
Probably the one thing that we could change
without a constitutional amendment that would

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:21.570
make a difference here would be the elimination
of the routine use of the filibuster in the

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.570
Senate.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:31.040
Because I think that does, in an era in which
the parties are more polarized, it almost

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.750
ensures greater gridlock and less clarity
in terms of the positions of the parties.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.400
There's nothing in the constitution that requires
it.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:48.060
The framers were pretty good about designing
a house, a senate, two years versus six year

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:52.210
terms, every state getting two senators.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:58.760
There were a whole bunch of things in there
to assure that a majority didn't just run

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760
rampant.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.730
The filibuster in this modern age probably
just torques it too far in the direction of

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:10.920
a majority party not being able to govern
effectively and move forward its platform.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.060
And i think that's an area where we can make
some improvement.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.000
Ezra: One of the powerful things that's happened
as polarization has increased politically

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.560
is it's begun structuring people's other identities.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.510
The one I'm particularly interested in here
is race.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.640
If you look back at polling around the OJ
Simpson verdict or the Bernhard Goetz shooting

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.200
in New York, Republicans and Democrats you
basically couldn't tell them apart.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.520
Now you look at the Zimmerman verdict or you
look at what's going on in Ferguson and opinion

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.890
on racial issues is very sharply split by
party.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.950
&nbsp;Do you worry about the merging of sort of
racial and partisan identity?

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.670
Obama: I don't worry about that because I
don't think that's going to last.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:56.780
I worry very much about the immediate consequences
of mistrust between police and minority communities.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:03.300
I think there are things we can do to train
our police force and make sure that everybody

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.430
is being treated fairly.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:13.610
And the task force that I assigned after the
Ferguson and New York cases is intended to

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:18.110
produce very specific tools for us to deal
with it.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:26.340
But over the long term, I'm pretty optimistic
and the reason is because this country just

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.790
becomes more and more of a hodge-podge of
folks.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:41.510
Again, this is an example where things seem
very polarized at the national level and media

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.860
spotlight, but you go into communities -- you
know one of the great things about being president

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:52.110
is you travel through the entire country and
you go to Tennessee and it turns out that

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.880
you've got this huge Kurdish community.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:07.620
And you go to some little town in Iowa and
you see some hasidic Jewish community, and

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:13.500
then you see a bunch of interracial black
and white couples running around with their

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.500
kids.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:21.160
And this is in these little farm communities
and you've got Latinos in the classroom when

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.670
you visit the schools there.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:30.700
&nbsp;So people are getting more and more comfortable
with the diversity of this country, much more

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:37.810
sophisticated about both the cultural differences
but more importantly the basic commonality

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.780
that we have.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:48.130
And you know the key is to make sure that
our politics and our politicians are tapping

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:55.050
into that better set of impulses rather than
our baser fears.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:24:05.490
And my gut tells me, and I've seen it in my
own career and you see it generally, a politician

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:12.320
who plays on those fears in America, I don't
think is gonna over time get a lot of traction.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:20.280
Even, you know, it's not a perfect analogy
but if you think about how rapidly the whole

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:27.730
issue of the LGBT community and discrimination
against gays and lesbians has shifted.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:39.440
The Republican party, even the most conservative,
they have much less ability I think to express

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.490
discriminatory views than they did even 10
years ago.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.580
And that's a source of optimism.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.860
It makes me hopeful.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.030
Ezra: On Obamacare, something that members
of your administration have always said, and

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:57.390
I think you may have said, there's been a
lot of language about it being a good start,

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.750
a platform to begin building.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.990
It's full of experiments, the idea is that
there will be learning, and there will be

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.990
change.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.310
It's been going -- now we're in the second
year of open enrollment -- what would you

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.270
like to see, if Congress were able to take
up a bill, to tweak, to improve, to change,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.680
to build on that platform.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.470
What specifically from what you wanted in
there originally or what we've learned since

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.470
it's actually been in operation.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.320
How would you like to see it improved?

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:31.460
Obama: Well, I'm not sure, Ezra, that we've
got enough years of it being in place to know

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.120
perfectly what needs to be improved, where
there's still gaps.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.360
&nbsp;It's been a year.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.640
So far the verdict is that this thing's working
for a lot of people.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.250
&nbsp;You've got 10 million people who've been
enrolled, you've got more folks who've been

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:53.410
signed up for the expanded Medicaid coverage,
you've seen health care inflation stay low

00:25:53.410 --> 00:26:00.680
or actually be significantly lower than before
the ACA was passed, satisfaction with the

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.160
insurance seems to be high.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:10.020
We haven't seen major disruptions to the medical
system that a lot of people had predicted.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.410
So, there's a lot of stuff that's working.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:23.810
Over time, I think seeing if we can do more
on delivery system reform, making sure that

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.650
we fill the gaps in those states that haven't
expanded Medicaid.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:34.740
The big problem we have right now with Obamacare
is that it was designed to make sure that

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.050
some subset of people qualified for Medicaid
and that's how that's how they were going

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.260
to get coverage, and others were going to
go into the exchanges because they had slightly

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.260
higher incomes.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:51.730
And because of the decision of the Roberts
court that we couldn't incentivize states

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:58.990
to expand Medicaid the way we had originally
intended, you’ve got a lot of really big

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:04.950
states, you've got tens of millions of people
who aren't able to get their Medicaid coverage.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.840
And so there's this gap.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.260
And that's probably the biggest challenge
for us.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:18.840
The good news is in dribs and drabs, much
as was true with the original Medicaid program,

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:24.390
you're starting to see Republican Governor
and Republican State Legislatures realize

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.180
that we're cutting off our nose to spite our
face.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:34.080
We've got an ideological objection to us helping
our own constituencies and our own health

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080
care systems.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:42.820
And to their credit, you've got folks like
John Kasich in Ohio and Snyder in Michigan

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:48.600
and now, most recently the governor up in
Alaska and others who are saying ‘You know

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.990
what this is the right thing to do.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.420
Let’s go ahead and expand it.’

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.460
So until that kind of settles, I don't think
we'll fully know where there's still gaps

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.850
in coverage, what more we still need to do.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:14.161
But I think that so far, at least, the performance
of the plans itself, not the website in the

00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:21.940
first three months but the performance of
the actual plans, you know has at least met

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.710
and perhaps exceeded a lot of people's expectations.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.920
The website, by the way, works great now.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.160
Ezra: I'm going to tag out and let Matt in.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:38.500
Thank you very much for taking the time, sir.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:44.740
Obama: Thank you, really enjoyed it.
