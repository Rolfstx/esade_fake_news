00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:17.293
OK. stand there, there, there.

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:18.650
You've got a circle for me?

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:22.418
Hi everybody, my name
is Ben Mezrich, and I'm an author.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.281
I'm here to talk about UFOs.

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:27.803
But I'll talk about how I got to UFOs

00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:31.356
because my parents get very upset
when I just talk about UFOs.

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:33.549
I'm a non-fiction writer.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.891
I never really wanted to be
a non-fiction writer.

00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:37.448
I hated non-fiction growing up.

00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:40.161
I loved TV, really bad TV,

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:42.592
like "Saved by the Bell"
and "Three's Company."

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:45.790
My parents, fearing the worst,
made a rule when we were little

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:50.135
that we had to read two books a week
before we were allowed to watch TV

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:53.744
so I became a speed reader
so that I could watch "Three's Company."

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:57.273
When I graduated from college,
I realized I wanted to be a writer.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:01:00.249
I locked myself in an apartment
in Boston nearby here,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.200
and I wrote nine novels in a year;

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:04.513
not something I recommend to any of you.

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:06.489
I was rejected by everyone in publishing.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.880
I got 190 rejection slips
- had them taped to the walls -;

00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:12.052
I look like a serial killer
in my apartment.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:14.900
I was even rejected
by a janitor at a publishing house

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:16.210
because I wrote manuscript

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.950
and sent it to an editor
who was no longer working there.

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:20.342
They got thrown in the trash.

00:01:20.343 --> 00:01:22.933
An editor took it out the trash
and then rejected me.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.550
So it seemed unnecessary,
but that's what happened.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.718
I went on and on and on,
and eventually, I found my way,

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.802
because I was hanging out in a bar
in Boston called "Crossroads"

00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:33.610
- Some of you may know "Crossroads" -

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.100
and there was a group of MIT kids there,
and they had tons of money.

00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:39.528
And it was all in 100 dollar bills.

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.969
I didn't know why they had
all this money in 100s.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.549
So I met the main guy; he invited me
to his apartment in the South End,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.194
and in his laundry was 250,000 dollars.

00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:50.949
I said, "Are you a drug dealer?"
And he said, "No."

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.646
He said, "Come to Vegas with me."

00:01:52.647 --> 00:01:58.168
I went to Vegas, and that turned out
to be the lead of the MIT blackjack team.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.421
I joined the team, and I wrote a book,
and it became the movie "21."

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:04.017
"21" was about to come out,
I was sitting at home,

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:07.250
and I got a weird little email
from a Harvard senior, and it said,

00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:11.160
"My best friend founded Facebook,
and no one's ever heard of him."

00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.046
Another weird little moment in my life:

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:15.825
I go out for a drink
and in walks Eduardo Saverin;

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:17.036
- you've seen the movie -

00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:19.813
kinda looks like the guy in the movie,
not as good-looking.

00:02:19.814 --> 00:02:23.511
if you watched 21, it was the best looking
group of MIT kids you've ever seen.

00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:27.092
"Social Network" was the best looking
Harvard kid you've ever seen.

00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:31.794
Anyways, Eduardo walks in, sits down,
and says, "Mark Zuckerberg fucked me."

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:35.527
As a journalist, I had to say,
"Tell me more!"

00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:38.966
And that became the movie
"The Social Network."

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:41.346
So that's the kind of things
I normally write.

00:02:41.347 --> 00:02:45.318
About a year and half ago,
I heard about another story.

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:47.320
It was about a guy named Chuck Zukowski.

00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:50.601
Chuck was a reserve sheriff's deputy
in Colorado.

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:53.711
Chuck was investigating
a cattle mutilation.

00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:57.514
Out here in Massachusetts, we don't know
a lot about cattle mutilations,

00:02:57.515 --> 00:02:59.964
but in the West,
they are an enormous problem:

00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:05.056
over 10,000 cows and horses
have been found lying on their left side,

00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:09.495
missing organs, all of of the cuts
are surgical and circular,

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:12.665
and bodies are
completely drained of blood.

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:15.049
This has been going on since the 60s.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.719
It's such a huge phenomenon,
that in the 70s,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.783
three state governors got together,

00:03:19.784 --> 00:03:22.379
petitioned the Attorney General
of the United States

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.528
and demanded an investigation.

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:29.064
The FBI investigated,
involving 100 agents over 10 years,

00:03:29.065 --> 00:03:30.525
and found nothing.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:31.996
No one's ever been arrested,

00:03:31.996 --> 00:03:35.113
there's not a single fingerprint,
not a single footprint,

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:38.568
these cows are just found lying there,
missing all their organs.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.918
It's really weird.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.369
Our sheriff's deputy, Chuck,
was investigating this,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.651
and he starts to think, "UFOs."

00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:47.461
He was immediately fired
from the Sheriff's Department.

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:50.703
This is what normally happens
when you say UFOs.

00:03:50.704 --> 00:03:53.723
Anyways, he decided
to become a UFO hunter.

00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:56.235
He got an RV, filled it with his family,

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.954
and started going up and down
the Midwest looking for UFOs.

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:03.059
His family didn't believe,
his wife is a total skeptic.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.095
I interviewed her, and I said,
"How did you put up with this?"

00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:09.529
And she said, "Well, it could be worse!
He could be off having affairs.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.577
He's just in the mountains
looking for aliens!"

00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:15.982
So anyways, he starts
to make a weird discovery.

00:04:15.983 --> 00:04:19.156
Turns out that the majority
of UFO sightings

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:23.287
occur along the 37th parallel
of the United States.

00:04:23.288 --> 00:04:27.737
It also turns out most cattle mutilation
are along the 37th parallel.

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:31.871
It also turns out that almost all
of America's underground military bases

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:34.552
are along the 37th parallel
of the United States:

00:04:34.553 --> 00:04:39.522
The Pentagon, Cheyenne Mountain,
Fort Knox, all the way over to Area 51.

00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:41.514
Chuck is investigating UFOs.

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.864
He starts to have weird run-ins.

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:46.582
You would think he's having run-ins
with the government

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:49.625
because the government used to
investigate UFOs in this country.

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:51.928
There was something
called Project Blue Book.

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:54.304
After that, there were
two other secret projects,

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:57.452
but the government
no longer investigates UFOs.

00:04:57.453 --> 00:05:01.144
It turns out Chuck was having run-ins
with a private corporation.

00:05:01.145 --> 00:05:04.904
This is true, and this is where we are
going down the rabbit hole a little bit.

00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:08.038
There's a company run by a billionaire
named Robert Bigelow.

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.968
Robert Bigelow made his money
from Budget Suites of America.

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.174
He then put most of his fortune
into something called Bigelow Aerospace.

00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:17.394
- You might heard of it -

00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:19.927
They have pieces
on the International Space Station.

00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:22.460
They make something
called the TransHab with NASA

00:05:22.462 --> 00:05:26.361
which is an inflatable gasket
that astronauts can live in.

00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:30.205
They are intending one day
to build hotels on the Moon.

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:31.766
- It was their original project.

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:33.320
Anyway, this is a real company.

00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:37.778
It turns out for the past 20 years,
they have been investigating UFOs.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.867
They're doing this in conjunction with
certain government organizations.

00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:46.738
If you get a copy of an FAA manual
that all of our civilian pilots use,

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:49.116
and you look through it,
deep into the writing,

00:05:49.117 --> 00:05:53.153
what a pilot's supposed to do
if they see something in the air,

00:05:53.154 --> 00:05:55.177
they don't report it to the FAA;

00:05:55.178 --> 00:05:58.344
they don't report to their airline
because then they will be fired;

00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:00.615
they report it to Bigelow.

00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:02.416
Bigelow gets all this information.

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:08.540
He sends out a well-paid for teams
of investigators who investigate UFOs.

00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.358
Chuck started having run-ins with them.

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:13.378
He didn't really know what was going on.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.260
The story comes to a head at Roswell,
as all UFO stories do.

00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:19.884
If you know anything
about Roswell, it's very kitschy,

00:06:19.885 --> 00:06:24.050
you can go there now and eat a hamburger
in an UFO-shaped restaurant

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:27.292
or go to the alien ball,
dressed as your favorite Wookie.

00:06:27.312 --> 00:06:31.633
But the reality is the story
behind Roswell is fascinating.

00:06:31.634 --> 00:06:37.061
In 1947, America's first nuclear base was
there: it's called Walker Air Force Base.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:39.736
They started to track something
coming through a storm

00:06:39.737 --> 00:06:41.819
in the middle of the night in July.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.372
Whatever that thing was,

00:06:43.373 --> 00:06:47.372
it was hit by lighting
and crashed on a ranch in Roswell.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:51.731
It's spread metallic debris
over 300 yards of this ranch.

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:55.230
The metallic debris was covered
in weird hieroglyphics,

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:58.187
it was made of the material
that people couldn't identify.

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:02.200
The rancher sees all this crap
on his lawn, he calls up the sheriff,

00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:04.082
the sheriff calls the Air Force Space.

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:05.718
They send out a team.

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:10.058
The team gathers up the debris
and then puts out a press release.

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:12.934
The press release
from the US Air Force says,

00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:15.927
"We now have
in our possession a flying saucer."

00:07:15.928 --> 00:07:17.046
This is true.

00:07:17.047 --> 00:07:20.253
Two hours later,
they rescind their press release.

00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:22.967
They gather up all the material,

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:25.244
they go for inch by inch
and gather it all up,

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:28.310
they put it on a plane,
first they land in Dallas,

00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:30.216
where they stage a photograph

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:34.115
with a radar operator sitting amongst
the debris of a broken weather balloon.

00:07:34.116 --> 00:07:36.305
Everyone who was involved
in that photograph

00:07:36.306 --> 00:07:38.580
has since come forward
and said it was fake.

00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:41.698
The person who took the photograph,
the person in the photograph,

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.224
and the person who ordered it.

00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:47.835
Anyways, the debris was then carted
to Area 51 where it is to this day.

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:52.999
For whatever reason, the Air Force
will not release the files on this crash.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.626
Hillary Clinton, a few month ago,
was on Jimmy Kimmel,

00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:58.714
and she said
if she were elected president,

00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:00.512
one of the first things she would do

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:04.034
was get the Air Force
to release the UFO files.

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:06.767
Sadly, that is not to be.

00:08:06.768 --> 00:08:08.657
(Laughter)

00:08:08.658 --> 00:08:11.673
I don't know if she was trying to go
for the UFO vote with that.

00:08:11.793 --> 00:08:15.202
I don't think there was enough UFO people
to get over her over the edge.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:20.816
Every president we've had,
with the possible exception of Obama,

00:08:20.817 --> 00:08:24.789
has believed in UFOs and has tried
to get these files released.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.747
Jimmy Carter believed,
Ronald Reagan believed,

00:08:27.748 --> 00:08:30.944
Bill Clinton tried twice to get
these files released and couldn't.

00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:34.470
Hillary wanted to do it, we don't know
whether Trump will or not.

00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:36.220
These files do exist.

00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:40.774
For whatever reason, the government
will not show us what was at Roswell.

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:46.247
I've seen documents which say it's still,
to this day, an unidentified debris.

00:08:46.248 --> 00:08:49.272
That's very strange.
This was a long, long time ago.

00:08:49.273 --> 00:08:53.124
So anyways, I dove into this story
about the 37th parallel,

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:56.574
and I have come to believe
that there is a very good chance

00:08:56.575 --> 00:09:00.450
that whatever crashed at Roswell
was not from here.

00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:02.806
As I said, my parents hate me saying that,

00:09:02.807 --> 00:09:07.198
because the reality is when you talk
about UFOs, there's a giggle factor.

00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:08.849
Everyone assumes you are nuts.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.347
A respected sheriff
can't look at a crash site

00:09:13.348 --> 00:09:16.032
and say it's an UFO without getting fired.

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:17.968
A journalist can't talk about UFOs

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:20.713
without hearing X-Files music
in the background.

00:09:20.714 --> 00:09:23.107
And no scientist can look into it

00:09:23.108 --> 00:09:26.506
with the possible exception of the people
that Robert Bigelow has hired.

00:09:26.507 --> 00:09:29.687
But we don't know what they are doing
with the materials they find.

00:09:29.688 --> 00:09:31.784
So I want to leave you with this:

00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:36.571
the impediments to believing
someone has come here from another planet,

00:09:36.572 --> 00:09:38.234
have actually disappeared.

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:41.315
We used to think
there wasn't life out there, right?

00:09:41.316 --> 00:09:43.915
Now we are all pretty sure
there probably is.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:46.510
We find an Earth-like planet
almost every day.

00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:49.998
We used to think these planets
are too far away, right?

00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:51.666
But we now know that's not true,

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:53.917
Proxima Centauri, which is
one of these planets

00:09:53.944 --> 00:09:57.794
is reachable by current
technology in 40 years.

00:09:57.795 --> 00:09:59.591
That's not that long.

00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:03.005
So, those two reasons
aren't around anymore.

00:10:03.006 --> 00:10:06.903
The Catholic Church recently
put out a weird little edict

00:10:06.904 --> 00:10:10.754
where they said, "If we do
discover life on other planets,

00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:13.154
it will not affect Catholic doctrine."

00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:14.998
(Laughter)

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:17.772
I think they're covering
their basis, right?

00:10:17.773 --> 00:10:22.310
But I think that there's a sea change
going on in the opinions

00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:24.655
of whether or not there's
life on other planets

00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:26.573
and whether or not
they could come here.

00:10:26.574 --> 00:10:29.881
And to be honest, looking at the news
that we are seeing every day,

00:10:29.882 --> 00:10:32.306
if a UFO landed
on the White House lawn tomorrow,

00:10:32.307 --> 00:10:34.599
it wouldn't even be
the top five strange things

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.063
in the newspaper today.

00:10:36.064 --> 00:10:38.888
Anyways, thank you very much.
I appreciated it. Thank you.

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:40.319
(Applause)
