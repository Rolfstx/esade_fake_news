00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.720
 There is a saying in Hong Kong films: 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.120
 "Wi-Fi bat-boo." 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.800
 This means "the only speed is unbreakable". 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.900
 "Wi-Fi bat-boo." 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.500
 This is in Cantonese, a language with tones, 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.189
 Which English speakers have difficulty distinguishing. So when the American says this phrase with 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.930
 Wrong tones - "wifi bat po" - you are getting Cantonese meme. 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.460
 "It has become a kind of joke that people will do send it to each other. It's like oh, that's bad ass 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.000
 Wi-Fi is very good. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.480
 "Wi-Fi bat-boo" is very funny. 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.500
 If English is your first language, you may be more familiar with a different joke: 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.440
 "Supplies!" 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.960
 This is the idea that East Asians mix Rs and Ls in English: 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.280
 "Herro hero!" 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.400
 It's an ongoing gag in Lost in Translation, 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.780
 Oscar-winning movie about two Americans grieving in Japan. 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.900
 "Lat pack. You know lat pack?" 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.540
 "Rat? Rat Pack." 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.290
 The film makes communication with the locals seem hopeless. 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.580
 Hey. Lip my store. “Hey? Lip them?” 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.480
 At one point, the character Scarlett Johansson asks: 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.600
 "Why are they changing Rs and L here?" 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120
 "Oh, for the ships." 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.160
 This movie might be a little rrrrr - rude, however 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.350
 Not a bad question. Because if you are a real curious, then foreign 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.140
 The tone gives us an opportunity to learn something about another language. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.910
 So this cup was applied to Japanese, Korean and Chinese speakers. 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.380
 "McFry!" "Herro." "Fa ra ra ra ra." 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.210
 But all of these languages ​​deal with Rs and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.300
 Ls in different ways. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.770
 First, we need to talk about the R sound 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.390
 In English. It turns out that there is not just one way to pronounce it. 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.700
 "Oh it's incredibly diverse." 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.479
 Eleanor Lawson uses ultrasound to study the English language 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.610
 Phonetics. "I shouted tr's which is kind of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.520
 Rrr sound. Maybe you can hear my t exploited p. So I do ara's voice. diverse. You can take 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.440
 The retroflex R where your tongue essentially curls upside down is under your palatine arch. 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.060
 "run Run." It says runched-r, which is common in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.100
 The North American English language is particularly complex. 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.490
 "Nurse. Nurse." 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.760
 Say the word fur. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.220
 The fur. How can you tell someone to put their tongue to make that R? 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.300
 The middle of the tongue rises in the mouth, 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.580
 While the root of the tongue is retracting. 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.200
 You may have some lip approximation, too. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.360
 R looks like this, where the air flow is not so blocked by the tongue or lips, and is called 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.560
 "Convergence" in the acoustics. 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.430
 "So form all of these structures in 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.800
 The same time can be very difficult for someone who is not used to producing that. " 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.610
 Voice r is one of the last vowels that English-speaking children learn to say. This 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.480
 It takes up to 5 adorable years for them to find out abroad. 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.560
 "Lilac. And red" 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.660
 The L-Audio in English can change depending on 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.340
 On its site in one word. Say the words "scoop" or "level". 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.959
 That the first L is "clear L" you can probably feel your tongue and touch the top of the mouth, 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.840
 Directly behind your front teeth. As in "command". But l at the end of the word is "dark L" 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.360
 It may not tip the tongue until you touch your mouth at all. 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.240
 "Dark L is the posterior position of the tongue that moves toward the soft palate and is 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.960
 It gives an o-ish sound like "Uhh O". 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.660
 "level." "level." 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.920
 So the English R and L are complicated, but still, "lat pack", rrr, llll-- it looks like 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.160
 Very different sounds. 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.660
 May help look at the Spanish - he says 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.600
 The word Salero. 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.180
 "Salero. Salt Shaker." 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.880
 "Salero" "Salero" 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.950
 This R - with tongue flap is made on the edge behind the front teeth 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.000
 Not too far from where L is pronounced. 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.209
 Japanese has this sound R. It does not have an lll in "lake" or rrr in "red". 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.700
 "We have ra ri ru re ro, which looks nice like L and R." 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.320
 These are the five syllables in Japanese that contain the tongue tongue flap: "ra ri ru re ro" 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.310
 Try saying: "ra ri ru re ro." 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.709
 When they are converted to the Latin alphabet, they're written like this, with the letter 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.889
 "s". But the Japanese R-Audio is actually closer to our L-Sound "no" than it is 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.659
 To English "ra". My name is Mariko and for every English-speaking language 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:34.830
 Friends, the intuition that they say is Mary Ko. And how do I explain to them just imagine 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.560
 My name is written with Maliko and you should be fine. 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.940
 When words migrate from English to Japanese, both Rs and Ls become Japanese rupees. 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.200
 "Garasu". 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.760
 "Karendaa". 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.020
 "Boringu". 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.240
 "Raito". 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.520
 There are thousands of these loan words that you 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.199
 Japanese speakers must learn with rrrs and ls, which are two sounds that are Japanese ears 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.889
 Not set to distinguish in the first place. 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.900
 Like Japanese, Korean does not have English RRR sound. They have this message. It's "Ryul". 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.880
 "Lear?" 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.800
 "Me Mujahideen." 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.280
 "Eh me." 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.340
 "The Mujahideen." 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.880
 "ul. me mujahideen." 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.580
 "Like my tongue goes straight to 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.600
 The roof of my mouth. Mujahideen. 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.319
 "RIEUL". It takes on a different sound depending on 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.020
 Its location inside the word. So when it follows a vowel, it contains 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.980
 The flap looks like a Japanese R. 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.540
 "Duriseo. Duriseo". 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.809
 This also means that it is written with 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:36.520
 The letter "r" when converted into a Latin script. 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.510
 Dorisu. But when he's on 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.860
 The end of the word or followed by a consonant, this sounds more like L-sound and it's 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.980
 Written in the Latin alphabet as "L". 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.069
 So it is unlikely that Korean speakers 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:53.999
 He will say "herro" since L-Audio can map on English L. 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.490
 But "Dark L" is not found in Korean. So when they are new to English, Koreans 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.119
 May use their own L sound in locations where we use the Dark L, near the end 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:09.140
 the words. "As the story unfolds, someone may change the world." 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.449
 There are at least 8 major Chinese languages, but we'll take a look at Mandarin and Cantonese. 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.600
 Both have a clear L sound. This is limited to the beginning of the sections. 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.440
 "Ling. It's like" pretty. " "No." Pull "." 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.460
 So the idea that they would change "fa la la" 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.920
 To "fa ra ra" is just a mistake and the makers of Christmas story should feel bad. 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.960
 Like Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese no 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.779
 You have a dark L sound like in "pull". But when they encounter L near the end 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.830
 A word in English, it tends to pronounced more like a vowel. 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.960
 "One hundred years, 90 years. I said we must respect this kind of people." 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.620
 "Choose the coldest possible. Really." 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.300
 Mandarin has the sound of p. At first 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.129
 From the syllable it looks like this: "zrr. Zrr. So actually, maybe R looks more like S 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.880
 The "treasure". zrr Rénxìng. " 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.440
 At the end of a syllable: "Eh". This means "son." 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.289
 Cantonese, on the other hand, does not have 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.000
 R sound at all. 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.379
 So when he speaks English, sometimes they use an aw sound or an L voice. 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:21.860
 "We just tried hard to prove ourselves." 

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:27.939
 Our ability to produce sounds in a new language depends in part on whether these sounds are 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:32.569
 Distinguished purposeful in our first language. So the Japanese speaker hears LP and rrr 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:36.800
 - It is very similar to the English hearing in Chinese tones. 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.060
 "Ling. Ling. Ling. Ling." 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:49.940
 "What. What. What. What. Yes. I know, people's minds are only blown." 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.860
 We all carry the rules of our mother tongue with us when we learn new languages. 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:04.000
 "Accent is your identity, so I don't want to look like an American or a British person." 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.760
 So if you hear a foreign accent, remember 

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:12.129
 It's a unique hybrid, it's like a striped lion - something you can only get if you are 

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:15.620
 Brave enough to venture beyond the comfort of your mother tongue. 

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.200
