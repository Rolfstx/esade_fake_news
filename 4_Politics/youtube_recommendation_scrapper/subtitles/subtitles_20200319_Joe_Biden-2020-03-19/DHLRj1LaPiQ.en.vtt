00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.020
Ladies and Gentlemen,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.000
Hasan Minhaj

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.000
*Cheering and clapping*

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.740
Wow

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.900
Thank you. Wow. Oh my god.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.560
Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the series finale

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.580
of the White House Correspondents' Dinner.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.100
*laughter*

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.080
Oh man.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.060
My name is Hasan Minhaj, or as i'll be known in a few weeks, number 830287

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060
*laughter*

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.500
Who would have thought,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.440
with everything going on in the country right now,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.660
that a Muslim would be standing on this stage

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.260
for the ninth year in a row baby!

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.020
we had 8 years of Barack, whats another year, i see you "fam"

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.380
I see you Barry, what you doin' right now? You jet skiing while the world burns? That's cool, that's cool.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.120
That's cool.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.540
For those of you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.700
who don't know me, I am a correspondent on the Daily show on Comedy Central.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.600
Now I see some of you whispering to each other,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.300
"What is Comedy Central?"

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.040
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.080
Um, its basically an internship for Netflix.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.840
*quiet laughter*

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.320
I'd like to than Jeff Mason and the White House Correspondence association for having me.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.960
I would say "it is an honor to be here" but that would be an alternative fact.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.240
It is not, uhhhh, no one wanted to do this, so of course it lands in the hands of an immigrant.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.700
That's how it always goes down.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.800
No one wanted this gig! No one.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.160
Don Rickles died just so you wouldn't ask him to do this gig, alright?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.780
RIP to Don Rickles, the only Donald with skin thick enough to take a joke like that.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.040
RIP to the legend.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Tha-that's my onlyâ€” That's my o-only Trump joke.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.980
I was explicitly told not to go after the administration. I promise you,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.560
That's my only Trump joke.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.840
("You were not told that!")

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.380
Believe me.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.820
it is amazing to be surrouded by some of the greatest journalists in the world

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.580
and yet when we all checked into the Hilton on friday we all got a USA today

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.300
everytime a USA today slides underneath my door it's like they're saying, "hey, you're not that smart right ?"

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.460
USA today is what happens when the coupon section takes over the newspaper

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
Is this an article about global warming or 50 cents off tide

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.440
Either way, the pictures are so pretty

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.900
Tonight, is about defending the first amendment and the freed press and I am truly honored to be here.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.520
I don't have a solution on how to win back trust

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.540
Because you are how the president gets his news

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.800
Not from advisers, not from experts, not from intelligence agencies

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:19.100
You can't make any mistakes because when one of you messes up, he blames your entire group.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.840
And now you know what it feels like to be a minority

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.420
And... and I can see some of you guys complaining, like what?

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.040
I gotta work twice as hard for half the credit? Remember...

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.040
You're a minority!

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.200
You guys got a lot more experience than me, but I got three decades of being brown.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.940
So if you want to survive the age of Trump, you gotta think like a minority.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.760
And now that you're a minority, oh man...

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.560
Everyone is gonna expect you to be the mouth piece for the entire group.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.960
So I hate to say it, but somewhere right now...

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.080
all of you are being represented... by Heraldo Rivera.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.620
See now that you are truly a minority

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.120
there is a distorted version of you out there

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.740
you know... Taco Bell for Mexican culture

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.120
Panda Express for Chinese culture

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.520
Huffington Post for Journalism

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.340
And Then

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.320
When you actually manage to do great work

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.120
You get hit with the most condescending line in the English language

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.200
Hey...

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.700
You're actually one of the good ones

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.920
Then you have to smile and say "Thank you"

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.280
Kinda sucks, doesn't it?

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.600
By the way, you guys are not really minorities, you guys are super white.... but...

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.300
...but...I can see MS NBC behind, "We got our minority card..."

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.300
No!

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:50.320
... but your work is invaluable. And I mean that, as a fake journalist. I am rooting for you.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.420
We're a hundred days in. One thousand, three hundred and sixty days to go.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:05.220
You guys are running the marathon, and I'm at the half-mile mark giving you tape for your nipples.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.300
So I'm wishing you nothing but the best!

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:20.000
You chafed then, you'll chafe ..... a long way to go!

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.140
This .... This has been one of the strangest events I have ever done in my life...

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.680
I'm being honest with you!

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.460
Like, I feel like I'm a tribute in The Hunger Games...

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:42.180
Like, if this goes poorly, Steve Bannon gets to eat me...  but...

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:50.500
I was asked to not roast the President and the administration, in their absentia

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.320
... and I completely understand that.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.220
We are in a very strange situation, where there's a very combative relationship

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.420
between the press and the President

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.420
but

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.420
now that you guys are minorities

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.420
just for this moment

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.040
You might understand the position I was in

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.880
and it's the same position a lot of minority kids feel in this country

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:22.120
and it's, you know,  "Do I come up here, and just try to fit in...?

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.900
... and not ruffle any feathers?"

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.600
... Or do I say how I really feel?"

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.260
Because this event is about celebrating the First Amendment and Free Speech.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.500
Free Speech is the foundation of an open and liberal democracy

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.580
from college campuses to the White House

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.460
Only in America

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.340
can a first generation Indian-American Muslim kid

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.800
get on this stage,

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.940
and make fun of the President!

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.560
The orange man behind the Muslim ban!

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.660
... and it's a sign to the rest of the world

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.180
it's an amazing tradition,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.620
that shows the entire world

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.060
that even the President

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.920
is not beyond the reach of the First Amendment.

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.780
But the President didn't show up!

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.360
Ale prezident se nezjel!

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.200
 

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.860
... because Donald Trump doesn't care about free speech!

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.740
The man who tweets everything that enters his head

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.189
refuses to acknowledge

00:24:32.189 --> 00:24:35.740
the Amendment that allows him to do it.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.040
Think about it, it's almost, what is it, eleven?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.880
It's eleven pm right now.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.520
In four hours, Donald Trump will be tweeting

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.420
about how bad Nicky Minhaj bombed at this dinner!

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.880
... and he'll be doing it, completely sober!

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.840
... and that's his right!

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.140
and I'm proud that all of us

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.020
are here tonight to defend that right.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.220
even if the man in the White House never would.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.420
So I'd like to thank the White House Correspondents' Association for having me here...

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.420
I want to thank all of you.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.780
I want to thank Woodward and Bernstein for inspiring a generation of journalists...

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.780
 

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.840
and I would like to thank Donald Trump

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.840
for inspiring the next!

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.200
Thank you so much, it's been an honor

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:26.900
 

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.860
Good night! I love you! Thank you!

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.660
Thank you, guys, I really appreciate it. Thank you!
