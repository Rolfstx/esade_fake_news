00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.868
(music)

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:04.504
President Obama: Well,
the White House is

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.238
the people's house.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:08.141
Michelle and I and the
girls, we understand that

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.745
we're here for a limited
time, and we're here

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.847
because we have this
incredible privilege of

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.682
serving the American
people and looking after

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.218
them and what they
are concerned about.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.487
(music)

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:24.357
I think everybody, the
first night they spend in

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.658
the White House, are
a little overwhelmed.

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:30.263
You know, the White
House is such an icon in

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:33.199
American life and around
the globe, and the notion

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.703
that you'd be sleeping in
a bed inside of it, is a

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.205
little bit intimidating.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.408
And, at least when you've
got a couple kids, you

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.877
pretty much get into a
routine because you know

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.479
that you're going to have
to figure out how to wake

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.981
them up, and make sure
they get to school

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.616
on that first day.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.986
So, the transition was
smooth, but that first

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.256
night you kind of wake up
with a start a little bit

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.258
and say to yourself, "My
goodness, what am

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.526
I doing here?"

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.361
(music)

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:04.864
Everyday -- although you
consider it the place you

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.834
live -- I think you're
very mindful that this is

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.804
a place of history; that
this is a place that

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.106
belongs to the people
and to the country.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.576
As much as you want to
feel comfortable in that

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.012
place, you also want to
feel a little bit of

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.614
reverence for the fact
that down these halls

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:26.719
Lincoln has walked, and in
these rooms FDR has made

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:32.859
decisions that had
impacts around the world.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.327
(music)

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.797
While you're here, you're
maybe part of the first

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:41.634
family, but once your
term's up you're going to

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.970
be a citizen once again.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.008
And that, I think, it both
humbling, but extremely

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.811
gratifying because it
reminds us that this is a

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:56.749
democracy, and those who
come into this office are

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.652
here temporarily and
someday soon there's going

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.821
to be somebody else who
takes up that mantle and

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.724
you just make sure that
during the time that

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.059
you're here you're doing
the best you can to serve

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.327
the people
who've sent you.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:15.435
(music)
