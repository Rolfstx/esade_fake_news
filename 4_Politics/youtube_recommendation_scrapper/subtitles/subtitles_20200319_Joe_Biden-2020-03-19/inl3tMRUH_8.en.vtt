00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 align:start position:0%
would test positive the people would go
 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
would test positive the people would go

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:12.470 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to understand what
 

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.650 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to understand what
those<00:51:12.860><c> relationships</c><00:51:13.100><c> are</c><00:51:13.940><c> we're</c><00:51:14.390><c> very</c>

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:14.660 align:start position:0%
those relationships are we're very
 

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.570 align:start position:0%
those relationships are we're very

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:16.580 align:start position:0%
interested in the curves in Italy
 

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.810 align:start position:0%
interested in the curves in Italy
because<00:51:17.210><c> of</c><00:51:17.650><c> their</c><00:51:18.650><c> different</c><00:51:19.070><c> approach</c><00:51:19.490><c> and</c>

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:19.820 align:start position:0%
because of their different approach and
 

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
because of their different approach and
we're<00:51:19.910><c> following</c><00:51:20.150><c> every</c><00:51:20.630><c> single</c><00:51:21.020><c> country's</c>

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:21.530 align:start position:0%
we're following every single country's
 

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.340 align:start position:0%
we're following every single country's

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:24.350 align:start position:0%

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.790 align:start position:0%

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.020 align:start position:0%
started later and so you're asking me to
 

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.770 align:start position:0%
started later and so you're asking me to

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:53.780 align:start position:0%
predict based on a later start and
