00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 align:start position:0%
and we're still looking got some more
 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.010 align:start position:0%
and we're still looking got some more
reagent<00:05:34.120><c> from</c><00:05:34.270><c> them</c><00:05:34.450><c> and</c><00:05:34.660><c> so</c><00:05:34.780><c> we're</c><00:05:34.900><c> looking</c>

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 align:start position:0%
reagent from them and so we're looking
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.830 align:start position:0%
reagent from them and so we're looking
at<00:05:35.320><c> more</c><00:05:35.530><c> of</c><00:05:35.590><c> that</c><00:05:35.860><c> to</c><00:05:36.010><c> come</c><00:05:36.160><c> forward</c><00:05:36.430><c> so</c><00:05:36.840><c> we</c>

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
at more of that to come forward so we
 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.270 align:start position:0%
at more of that to come forward so we
hope<00:05:37.990><c> with</c><00:05:38.169><c> that</c><00:05:38.200><c> and</c><00:05:38.590><c> with</c><00:05:38.890><c> our</c><00:05:39.040><c> satellite</c>

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
hope with that and with our satellite
 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.659 align:start position:0%
hope with that and with our satellite

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
then you have community wide and that
 

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.300 align:start position:0%
then you have community wide and that

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:06.330 align:start position:0%
but I think they can honor that because
 

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.370 align:start position:0%
but I think they can honor that because
they're<00:42:06.450><c> going</c><00:42:06.570><c> to</c><00:42:06.630><c> be</c><00:42:06.690><c> close</c><00:42:06.900><c> contacts</c>
