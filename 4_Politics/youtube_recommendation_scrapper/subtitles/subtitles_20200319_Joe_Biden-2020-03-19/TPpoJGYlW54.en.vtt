00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.680
It was New Years Eve, 2019 when health officials
in China admitted they had a problem.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.980
Health authorities have activated their most serious response level.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.000
After an outbreak of a new type of viral pneumonia

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.940
in central China.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.400
A rapidly growing number of people were developing
a dry cough and fever, before getting pneumonia.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.080
And for some, it turned fatal.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.840
Doctors have named the disease COVID-19 or
“coronavirus disease, 2019” indicating

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.250
that a type of virus is causing the illness.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.520
When they’d tried to trace its origin, they
found a likely source:

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.239
This food market in Wuhan.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.340
Out of the first 41 patients, 27 had been
here.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.770
It wasn’t conclusive evidence, but Chinese
officials quickly shut down the market.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
They had seen this happen before at a place
just like this.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.240
Health officials are trying to get a grip on an alarming outbreak of SARS.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.340
The virus originated in mainland China.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.540
Then spread across the country.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.180
The disease had been festering for months in southern China.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.320
In 2002, a coronavirus had emerged at a very
similar market, in southern China.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.010
It eventually reached
29 countries and killed nearly 800 people.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.970
Now, 18 years later, this coronavirus is in
at least 71 countries and has already killed

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.160
over 3100 people.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.601
So, what do these markets have to do with
the coronavirus outbreak… and why is it

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.060
happening in China?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.600
A lot of the viruses that make us sick, actually
originate in animals.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.330
Some of the viruses that cause the flu come
from birds and pigs.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.920
HIV/AIDS comes from chimpanzees.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.672
The deadly Ebola virus likely originates in
bats.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:53.450
And in the case of the 2019 coronavirus, there
is some evidence it went from a bat to a pangolin

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.990
before infecting a human.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.670
While viruses are very good at jumping between
species, it’s rare for a deadly one to make

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.540
this journey all the way to humans.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.280
That’s because it would need all these hosts
to encounter each other at some point.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280
That’s where the Wuhan market comes in.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.940
It’s a wet-market.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.880
A kind of place where live animals are slaughtered
and sold for consumption.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.900
Peter Li is a professor and expert on China’s
animal trade.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.380
That’s exactly how a virus can jump from
one animal to another.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.400
If that animal then comes in contact with
or is consumed by a human, the virus could

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.530
potentially infect them.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.840
And if the virus then spreads to other humans,
it causes an outbreak.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.000
Wet-markets are scattered all over the world,
but the ones in China are particularly well

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.400
known because they offer a wide variety of
animals, including wildlife.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.540
This is a sample menu, reportedly from the
market in Wuhan.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.980
These animals are from all over the world
and each one has the potential to carry its

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.590
own viruses to the market.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.790
The reason all these animals are in the same
market is because of a decision China’s

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.810
government made decades ago.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.770
Back in the 1970s, China was falling apart.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.780
Famine had killed more than 36 million people.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.700
And the communist regime, which controlled
all food production, was failing to feed its

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.180
more than 900 million people.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.760
In 1978, on the verge of collapse, the regime
gave up this control and allowed private farming.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.280
While large companies increasingly dominated
the production of popular foods like pork

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.590
and poultry, some smaller farmers turned to
catching and raising wild animals as a way

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.140
to sustain themselves.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.480
And since it started to feed and sustain people, the Chinese government backed it.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.940
But then in 1988, the government made a decision
that changed the shape of wildlife trade in

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.940
China.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.290
They enacted the Wildlife Protection Law which
designated the animals as “resources owned

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.940
by the state” and protected people engaged
in the “utilization of wildlife resources”.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.900
The law also “encouraged the domestication
and breeding of wildlife.”

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.660
With that, an industry was born.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.580
Small local farms turned into industrial-sized
operations.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.700
For example, this bear farm started with just
three, and eventually grew to more than 1,000 bears.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.240
Bigger populations meant greater chances that
a sick animal could spread disease.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.440
Farmers were also raising a wide variety of
animals.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.180
Which meant more viruses on the farms.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.510
Nonetheless, these animals were funneled into
the wet-markets for profit.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.630
While this legal wildlife farming industry
started booming, it simultaneously provided

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.750
cover for an illegal wildlife industry.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.790
Endangered animals like tigers, rhinoceroses,
and pangolins, were trafficked into China.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.740
By the early 2000s, these markets were teeming
with wild animals when the inevitable happened.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.700
The latest on the deadly SARS virus, the worldwide death toll up again today.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.240
China has reported more than 1,400 cases of infection nation-wide.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.440
It is what health officials have feared all along.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.060
In 2003, the SARS outbreak was traced to a
wet-market here, in southern China.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.320
Scientists found traces of the virus in farmed
civet cats.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.680
Chinese officials quickly shut down the markets
and banned wildlife farming.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.350
But a few months after the outbreak, the Chinese
government declared 54 species of wildlife

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.180
animals, including civet cats, legal to farm
again.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.860
By 2004, the wildlife-farming industry was
worth an estimated $100 billion yuan.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.600
And it exerted significant influence over
the Chinese government.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.420
It's because of this influence that the Chinese
government has allowed these markets to grow

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.430
over the years.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.639
In 2016, for example, the government sanctioned
the farming of some endangered species like

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.350
tigers, and pangolins.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.040
By 2018, the wildlife industry had grown to
148 billion yuan and had developed clever

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.150
marketing tactics to keep the markets around.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.460
Yet, these products became popular with an
influential portion of China’s population:

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.890
It’s this minority that the Chinese government
chose to favor over the safety of the rest

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.440
of its population.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.120
Soon after the coronavirus outbreak,
the Chinese government shut down thousands

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.330
of wet-markets and temporarily banned wildlife
trade again.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.039
Organizations around the world have been urging
China to make the ban permanent.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.520
Chinese social media, in particular, has been
flooded with petitions to ban it for good this time.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.070
In response, China is reportedly amending
the Wildlife Protection Law that encouraged

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.650
wildlife farming decades ago.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.770
But unless these actions lead to a permanent
ban on wildlife farming, outbreaks like this

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.300
one are bound to happen again.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.760
For a bunch more information about China’s wet-markets, viruses, and wildlife,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.060
we have an episode on our Netflix show called The Next Pandemic, explained.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.520
It talks about a coronavirus could spark the next pandemic and what the world’s experts are doing to stop it.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.520
That’s on our Netflix show ‘Explained’. Check it out.
