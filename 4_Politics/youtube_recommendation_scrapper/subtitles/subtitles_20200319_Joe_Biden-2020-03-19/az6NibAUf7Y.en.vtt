00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.690
The most obsolete idea

00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:05.198
is go to school, get a job,
work hard, save money,

00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:08.047
get out of debt and invest for
the long-term in the stock market

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.141
See, why would you save money

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.221
when they're printing
trillions of dollars?

00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:16.434
The gap between the 1% and 99% is massive.

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:18.362
You see it's not just money,

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:20.528
you have to step back
and look at the bigger picture.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:22.583
So what do you do?

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:27.107
In every one of us there's a poor person,

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:29.399
there's still a poor person inside me.

00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:32.065
There's also a middle-class person

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:34.065
and the middle-class
person wants security

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:35.914
they want that steady paycheck.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.969
And there's a rich person

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.611
And they're all inside
of us except that...

00:00:43.404 --> 00:00:44.777
It's not taught.

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:48.301
It's- you're taught to go to school,
get a job and get a paycheck.

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:50.944
Not taught how to get rich.

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:55.118
If you've read Rich Dad Poor Dad,
my rich dad refused to pay me.

00:00:55.753 --> 00:00:56.935
He said the paycheck

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.824
was one of the most damaging
things you can take in your life.

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:03.014
He says the moment you take
a paycheck you're an employee

00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:05.038
and that's the mindset.

00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:07.021
So my rich dad never paid me.

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:10.076
It drove my poor dad, you know,
a government employee nuts.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.568
"You got to pay people,
you got to pay people"

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:15.622
And rich dad was not saying
that the paycheck was bad,

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:18.677
he says he didn't want
to be a slave to money.

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:21.009
So as an entrepreneur,

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:23.739
you know, if rich dad folded

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:25.404
I just try another company.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.189
I don't need a paycheck.

00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:29.561
I don't need anybody to take care of me.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.251
If my government doesn't like me
I move to another country

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.171
because they need entrepreneurs there.

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:36.821
So the entrepreneur
is not so much the business,

00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:40.527
the entrepreneur is really
the mindset and the skill sets

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:42.677
and the different set of rules.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:46.183
You see, I don't operate small business

00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:48.905
does not not operate in
the same rules as big business.

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:52.428
Entrepreneur is a mindset first,

00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:55.309
a skill set and rules.

00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:59.252
And depending upon whether you're
an employee or small business

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:00.934
the rules are different,

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:03.647
the mindsets are different,
the skill sets are different.

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:07.512
If you could say one thing to somebody
whose never been an entrepreneur

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.940
and they're thinking about
making the leap of faith

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:11.249
into becoming an entrepreneur,

00:02:11.274 --> 00:02:13.178
what could you tell them?

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.639
Well, I'll just tell them the same
thing that happened to me.

00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:22.487
You know, my last paycheck,
I still remember it clearly

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.764
it was one of the worst
and the best days of my life

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:27.478
and I was in Puerto Rico,

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.828
I was in, I was working for Xerox

00:02:29.947 --> 00:02:33.304
and my boss gave me my last,
it wasn't a paycheck it was a bonus check

00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:35.264
I think it was about 30,000 bucks

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.288
taxable, that's the only problem with that.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:40.200
So I get this check
and I went, "Holly mackerel."

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:42.906
You know, I mean, so I was excited

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.930
but I was also disturbed.

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.953
And so this other guy comes up
to me, his name was John

00:02:47.977 --> 00:02:49.453
and John says to me says to me this,

00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:51.477
"you're going to be back."
I said "Why?"

00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:53.119
he says, "because you're going to fail."

00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:55.174
I looked at him and I said, "look...

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920
few expletive words

00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:01.491
Because that's what he did,
he left Xerox, failed and he came back.

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:04.141
I said, "look...

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.664
You fail and you came back

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:09.362
but I'm going to fail
and I'm never coming back."

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.218
and that's the attitude.

00:03:11.242 --> 00:03:12.774
- Do you know what I mean,
- yeah

00:03:12.798 --> 00:03:15.734
If you say, "Well, if I fail
I'll go back to mommy and daddy"

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.210
then that's what you'll do.

00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:21.059
So if you fail, that's when I became
an entrepreneur because I had no money.

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:23.060
I had no money for years

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:25.321
Yeah, I didn't have a paycheck

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:27.623
But that's what my rich dad
encouraged me to do.

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:30.035
He says when,
when you don't have this paycheck

00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:33.764
you get hungrier, smarter
and it's a test of your character

00:03:34.058 --> 00:03:36.636
will you become a crook?
Will you become dishonest?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.040
Will you cheat and steal?

00:03:38.065 --> 00:03:40.398
Or will you become a better human being?

00:03:40.857 --> 00:03:43.983
So really that's the benefit
of becoming an entrepreneur

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:45.895
you really find out who you are

00:03:45.974 --> 00:03:47.974
when you don't have anything.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.894
So you always have
to look at the big picture.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.752
Too many people look at, "well,
what's, what's going to happen to me?"

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:56.934
When you look at the big picture,
you're also going to know

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.401
that when something bad happens
something good is going to happen.

00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:03.424
But you gotta prepare
for whatever is coming

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:06.907
If you think the next 20 years
will be like the last 20 years

00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:08.050
you're going to get creamed.

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:09.923
You know, when you
and I go to the supermarket

00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:11.597
and we buy a carton of milk

00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:14.058
We always check for the expiration date.

00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:18.335
But most people do not check for
the expiration date on their brains

00:04:19.415 --> 00:04:22.081
Instead of getting out
of debt I get into debt.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.594
I just refinanced 300 million in debt

00:04:25.618 --> 00:04:28.443
I went from 5% to 2.5% interest

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:29.800
I made a fortune.

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:34.077
Every month more money comes in
because my cost of money has gone down.

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:37.497
So while some financial experts
are saying get out of debt,

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.521
I'm saying learn how to use debt.

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:42.719
See when I came back
from serving in Vietnam

00:04:42.743 --> 00:04:44.949
in January of 73

00:04:44.973 --> 00:04:46.711
and the first thing my
rich dad said to me was,

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:49.544
"Go to school to learn how
to invest in real estate."

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:52.996
It wasn't real estate, it was
how to use debt and taxes

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.781
debt and taxes make the rich richer.

00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:58.971
Debt and taxes make the poor
and middle class poorer.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.169
So all the rich guys who are
doctors and lawyers or...

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.382
you know, those guys,
they're getting creamed

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.056
- and they don't know why
- doctors are getting creamed?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.730
Oh, yeah, they're making more money
but the take-home is less

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:14.435
You know, my doctor just yelled at me

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.141
he's happy, he says, "Oh, guess what
I finally made a million dollars."

00:05:18.165 --> 00:05:20.871
And I said, "Yeah",
this is just three weeks ago.

00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:23.529
And so I said, "Yeah,
well how much you pay in tax?"

00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:26.299
He says, "$750,000 in taxes."

00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:28.893
So his net was about $400,000

00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:30.512
That's not bad

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.614
but when I make a million bucks,
I keep a million bucks.

00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.740
And the reason is because I don't
make it by working for money.

00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:38.764
See if you work for money your taxed.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.620
So that's why lesson number one
in Rich Dad Poor Dad

00:05:41.644 --> 00:05:43.350
is the rich don't work for money.

00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:46.858
What we do instead is we create
businesses as entrepreneurs.

00:05:46.882 --> 00:05:48.501
We acquire real estate.

00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:50.323
I don't invest in the stock market

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:53.639
So the reason is because as entrepreneurs

00:05:53.663 --> 00:05:56.916
I have more control over my income,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.273
how much I make
and how much I pay in taxes.

00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:04.773
And because I'm an entrepreneur
as well as an investor in real estate

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.122
I pay zero tax.

00:06:06.146 --> 00:06:09.820
So every time I make let's say
a million dollars as an entrepreneur

00:06:09.844 --> 00:06:13.828
I immediately invest it in real estate, and
I have a 4 to 1 step up.

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:17.709
So I put a million dollars in real estate,
I get four million from the bank.

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:19.066
That's why I love banks.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.970
But the banks are screwing everybody else

00:06:20.994 --> 00:06:23.295
you know, terrible but it's good for me.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.509
I thought you said when you
print it's good for you

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:27.723
but when you print it's bad
for people that work for money.

00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:30.056
Because when you print savers get creamed

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.484
and people who work for money get creamed.

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:34.611
When they print debtors get rich.

00:06:34.635 --> 00:06:39.119
You see, debt and taxes
make the rich richer

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.094
and debt and taxes make
the poor and middle class poorer.

00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:48.324
When we have obsolete ideas
we get obsolete results.

00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:51.069
So what's happening for most people

00:06:51.093 --> 00:06:53.093
the idea of going to school,

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:58.005
getting a job, working hard,
saving money, getting out of debt,

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.171
buying your house because it's
an asset and investing for a long term.

00:07:01.195 --> 00:07:02.893
It's obsolete.

00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:06.431
The world has changed,
the world changed in 1971

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.454
when President Nixon
took us off the gold standard

00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:11.795
and money became debt.

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.428
What if we get rid of school
then what would happen?

00:07:14.453 --> 00:07:17.254
Would it be better if we had
no educational system at all?

00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:20.736
No, I'm saying education was more
important before, it's just obsolete.

00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:22.958
You know, there's Moore's law that...

00:07:22.982 --> 00:07:26.394
Moore's law which states information
doubles every 18 months.

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.887
In other words,
everything is obsolete, 18 months.

00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:31.093
So, and this is a recent phenomenon.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.323
So when you come out of school,
you're already obsolete,

00:07:33.347 --> 00:07:34.704
and that's why I'm the old guy,

00:07:34.728 --> 00:07:36.497
you know, I meet
my friends, I went to Harvard.

00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:38.274
Yeah, I went to Harvard. I said,

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:40.614
"Yeah, that was how long
50 years ago?"

00:07:40.638 --> 00:07:44.828
Today the banks are charging
you interest to save money.

00:07:44.852 --> 00:07:47.352
In other words,
the banks don't want your money

00:07:47.376 --> 00:07:49.518
because they've printed too much of it.

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:53.462
And that's why there's bubbles and stocks
and bubbles in real estate and all this.

00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:55.605
People are dumping the cash.

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:59.192
Because as I said in here,
"Savers are losers and cash is trash"

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.834
And yet people are,
"Well, I want a high-paying job."

00:08:01.858 --> 00:08:03.548
Well, that's an obsolete idea.

00:08:03.572 --> 00:08:05.270
Get out of debt, it's an obsolete idea.

00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:08.706
You should learn how to get into debt
How to you use debt to get rich

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.730
And they'll never teach you about taxes.

00:08:10.754 --> 00:08:14.896
The reason the 1% is way up here
and the 99% are going this way

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.483
is because when you print
money two things happen

00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:19.340
inflation and taxes.

00:08:19.364 --> 00:08:21.364
It's crushing them.

00:08:22.522 --> 00:08:24.887
And any entrepreneur that thinks
"I'm just going to make money

00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:27.855
and start a business and make a lot of
money because that what we talk about

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:30.736
They really have got
to smell the roses man.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.719
You know, that's not what
the real entrepreneurs are doing.

00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:40.020
Most entrepreneurs, there's 28 million
small business owners in America

00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:44.654
24 million are,
are one person entrepreneurs.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.701
They're called non-employee entrepreneurs.

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:49.923
So that because, and that's what happens

00:08:49.948 --> 00:08:53.765
is when people don't really
understand what an entrepreneur does.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.725
So most people are self-employed,
but they're not really entrepreneurs.

00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:01.851
The self-employed pay
the highest taxes of all

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.604
and nobody tells them that.

00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:07.976
Yeah, it's also called
the entrepreneurial spirit

00:09:08.555 --> 00:09:10.301
but what we're actually talking about

00:09:10.326 --> 00:09:13.095
was there's no such
thing as a bad economy.

00:09:13.538 --> 00:09:17.538
You know those externally, you and I,
we all have an external economy.

00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:19.903
But we also have an internal economy

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:23.196
and the will power is to
change our internal economy.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.910
So for me, I can see the good,
I can see the bad

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:28.441
I don't really give a damn.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.702
Because I'm going to be rich anyway.

00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:34.440
But a poor person with
a poor personal economy

00:09:34.464 --> 00:09:37.194
All they're going to see is a bad economy.

00:09:37.361 --> 00:09:40.900
Because they don't know how
to make money in any economy.

00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:43.835
And a middle-class person,
they have a middle-class economy

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:47.216
you know what they want is
a nice house, a steady paycheck

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.462
and the job and the car.

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:52.930
And so when you take their
job away to them that's disaster.

00:09:52.954 --> 00:09:56.914
Well since an entrepreneur doesn't
have a job anyway, it's no big deal.

00:09:57.152 --> 00:10:00.755
So all I'm saying to people
is what Bucky Fuller taught me.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.008
There's always two sides,
you know what I mean,

00:10:03.032 --> 00:10:05.484
you know to use plural at minimum two.

00:10:05.508 --> 00:10:09.587
So if you think the economy is bad,
it's because your economy is bad.

00:10:09.793 --> 00:10:13.332
If you think that steady,
you know, employment is important

00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:17.252
- then you'll see an economy without jobs.
- Your economy

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:20.427
Your economy versus the external economy.

00:10:20.451 --> 00:10:21.966
Where you control VS
where you can't control

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.410
I can control yes, it's called,
it's called an internal focus

00:10:25.434 --> 00:10:27.648
versus an external focus.

00:10:27.672 --> 00:10:31.156
So the real entrepreneur
has an internal focus

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.068
but if they fall down
they say, "Oh, this is good

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.893
because I'm going to go up higher."

00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:37.551
You know, the average
person will fall down and

00:10:37.576 --> 00:10:39.227
say "Oh, I'm going to take some Prozac"

00:10:39.266 --> 00:10:42.908
Or, or the- or somebody has the mistakes,
all the mistakes don't matter well

00:10:42.932 --> 00:10:45.701
Mistakes, mistakes matter,
it means you didn't know something.

00:10:46.264 --> 00:10:48.835
But a real entrepreneur
whether they fall down

00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:50.874
or they go, they always can go up

00:10:50.898 --> 00:10:53.088
They can stand back up and go higher.

00:10:53.112 --> 00:10:54.691
That no matter what happens to them

00:10:54.715 --> 00:10:58.294
they got stronger and better
and smarter and happier.

00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:02.000
But a person with a weak internal mindset

00:11:02.476 --> 00:11:05.865
Is that they're so afraid of
what happens, it generally happens.

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:08.190
Like, you know, people who are
afraid of losing their jobs

00:11:08.214 --> 00:11:09.952
they generally lose their jobs.

00:11:09.977 --> 00:11:10.999
- You know what I mean,
- yeah,

00:11:11.023 --> 00:11:13.023
no doubt, so everything comes through you

00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:16.379
Yeah, so the entrepreneur
first job is control inside here

00:11:16.403 --> 00:11:17.863
not outside there.

00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:21.489
The moment you take that
paycheck you're an employee

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.361
You've got to be stronger than that.

00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:25.385
It's about inside control.
