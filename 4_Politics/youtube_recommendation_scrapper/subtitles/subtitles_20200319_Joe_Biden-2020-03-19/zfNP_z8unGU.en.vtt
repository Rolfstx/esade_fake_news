00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.436
Thank you!

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.405
(cheering and applause continue)

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.845
Do you ever get used to this?

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.181
It's a good feeling
to get used to.

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.384
-Thank you very much.
-(cheering and applause)

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.553
It feels like...

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:23.890
It literally feels like
you are the political Beatles.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.492
That's what you are. You're
all of them, rolled into one.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.494
-MAN: I love you, Bernie!
-Is-is it strange--

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:30.430
is it strange
to be in a position where,

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.932
in 2016, you were
the insurgent candidate--

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.401
you know, you were-- you were
leading a political revolution--

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.937
but now you're entering the race
as a frontrunner?

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.406
Um, like, d-does that
feel different for you?

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.941
Are you gonna do things
differently this time around?

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.409
It does feel differently.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.079 line:0%
And-and what's happened is that,
four years ago,

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.581 line:0%
Trevor, the ideas
that we talked about,

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:51.918 line:0%
the idea that health care is a
human right, not a privilege...

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.120 line:0%
-Right.
-(cheering and applause) -Yeah.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:57.790
Four years ago, that was
perceived as a radical idea.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.192
Not anymore!

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:02.995
The idea that if you work
40 hours a week in this country,

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.331
you should make
at least 15 bucks an hour

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.999
and not live in poverty,

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.535
-not a radical idea anymore!
-(cheering and applause) -Right.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:13.206
The idea that,
in a competitive global economy,

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.876
our young people need
the best education possible--

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.146
we should make public colleges
and universities tuition-free

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.216
and reduce student debt
substantially...

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.418
(cheering and applause)

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:27.220
Again, four years ago,

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.489
you will recall,
"Oh, Bernie's crazy.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.758
I mean, there's just-- Nobody in
America supports those ideas."

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.894
-Yes. -Well,
four years have come and gone.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.362
Those ideas are now supported

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:37.964
by a majority
of the American people.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.365
(cheering and applause)

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:42.034
So...

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:44.570
So, then-- so, then you're done.
Why run?

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:46.239
(laughs)

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.241
One little problem.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.944
We have to take on an incredibly
powerful establishment

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.447
that, to a large degree,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.049
controls the economic and
political life of this country.

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:58.718
-Right.
-And when we talk--

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.053
The, you know--
the mantra of our campaign

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:03.389
is "Not me. Us."

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:05.124
And the reason for that is,

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:06.526
to take on Wall Street,

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:09.328
to take on the greed
of the pharmaceutical industry

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.264
and the insurance companies,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.932
and if you want to save
the planet,

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.401
you're gonna have to take on
the fossil fuel industry,

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:17.737
and that means
millions of people

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.473
are gonna have to stand up
and fight back

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.208
in a way
that we have never done before.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.876
And that's what this campaign
is about.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.545
You know,
the media has picked up

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.480
on we raised a lot of money,
and that's great.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:30.316
What was more important to me,
Trevor,

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.852
is we have over a million people
who are prepared

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.521
to volunteer on this campaign,
which is unprecedented.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:38.724
-It's interesting that you,
uh... -(cheering and applause)

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.726
It's interesting
that you bring that up,

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.862
because you-you have raised
a lot of money--

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.331
I believe, $18 million
in under six weeks.

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:46.499
You-You're breaking records,

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.634
raising money
from individuals who say,

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.236
"Hey, we want to help you out,
Bernie."

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.572
But you hate the banks.
So where do you keep the money,

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.907
-under a mattress?
Where do you... -(laughs)

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.509
-Well...
-(laughing)

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.377
Still there. All right.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.645
Let's-let's talk about--

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:01.247
let's talk
about this Democratic field.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.548
This is an interesting time

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:04.717
where this field is more diverse
than ever before.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.352
But some people have said,
"All right,

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:09.021
"you have a diverse field, but
it feels like the frontrunners

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:11.123
are still old white men."
You still have yourself,

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:12.658
you have Joe Biden,
who's not even in the race.

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:14.260
-You're not talking
about me, are you? -No, no, no.

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:15.561
-(laughter) -Oh.
-No, of course... of course not.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:16.762
I mean, the white men,
the old white men.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.264
Those older guys. Yes.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:19.799
Um, but-but... but how do you
respond to that criticism

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.001
that people sometimes say like,
"Oh, well, isn't this a time

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:23.769
for you guys to step aside?"

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:25.438
Look, I think

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.173
the American people have
to make that decision.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.941
-Right.
-No-Nobody else makes it.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:32.645
And what I believe what politics
is about is taking a hard look

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:35.248
at the ideas and the history

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.550
and the experience
that candidates have.

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.118
And let me be very clear.

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.921
I know, you know, certainly all
of the senators who are running

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:43.856
for president,
and without exception,

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.825
that are good, smart,
dedicated people.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.727
-Many of them are my friends.
-Right.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.363
So you're not gonna hear me
disparaging other candidates.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.465
Uh, but I think
it is appropriate

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.601
for people to say, "Okay, uh,

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:58.971
"who has been talking
about this issue when?

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:01.173
"Who had the courage
to go forward,

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:03.209
-uh, and at what time?"
-Right.

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:06.212
So it's important not to look
at just personalities.

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:08.447
I think in American politics
in general,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.949
-we do too much of that.
-Yes.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:11.817
What we need to do is to say,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.453
"Okay, we have massive levels
of income and wealth inequality.

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:17.657
"As a nation, are we happy that
three people own more wealth

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.492
"than the bottom half
of America?

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:23.396
"Are we happy that billionaires
are able to buy elections?

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.332
"How do we change that?
How do we create a nation

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:28.534
-in which you have universal
childcare?" -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.436
Where you don't have
half of our people

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.104
living paycheck to paycheck.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:35.875
So I think what we need to do is
focus on a progressive agenda.

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:38.511
And I'm proud of the fact
that I've been a leader

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.646
in fighting for that agenda
for a long time.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.682
It's interesting. Basically,
what you're saying is...

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:46.252
(applause and cheering)

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.187
You're basically saying,
people have jumped on,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.389
-but you're the O.G.
of this idea. -(laughter)

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.391
That's-that's essentially
what you're saying.

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:54.527
And-and interestingly enough,
as an O.G.,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.262
you've-you've managed to connect
with groups

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.364
that many people haven't been
able to connect with.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:00.533
I mean, you're-you're able
to connect with young voters.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.702
You know, historically,
18 to 29-year-olds don't vote.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.337
-Right. That's right.
-You know?

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.305
But they've... they've-they've
come out for you.

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:07.606
We've seen this repeatedly.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.275
It's also been interesting
to see

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:12.278
that you are actually leading
with minority voters, as well.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.280
The people that have been polled
right now.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:17.483
What do you think is driving
those... those-those voters?

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:19.318
Why do you think
you're connecting so well

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:20.720
with young people
who don't think

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.455
voting is usually worth it?

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:26.125
Uh, I think that this generation
is, in my view,

00:05:26.158 --> 00:05:29.628
the most progressive generation

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:32.331
probably in the history
of the United States of America.

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.934
-This is a generation
of young people... -Right.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:37.236
(applause and cheering)

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:40.673
...who are not going
to tolerate racism

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:44.377
or sexism or homophobia
or xenophobia

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.646
or religious bigotry,
all of which, sadly,

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.216
the president of
the United States is giving us.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.552
And I think it is also
a generation, Trevor,

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:55.321
and we should make
this point out--

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:57.590
they're not doing well
financially, all right?

00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:00.960
Everything being equal,
this is a generation that,

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.628
unless we turn it around,

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.030
will have a lower standard
of living than their parents.

00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:06.432
They are leaving...

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:09.201
I just met with some young
people yesterday in my office.

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:11.904
Young people who are going
into teaching

00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:15.741
$180,000 in debt
for college loans.

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:17.443
That's not uncommon.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.745
People, young people
can't afford apartments.

00:06:19.778 --> 00:06:21.547
They're living
with their parents.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.916
So they understand
that we need to have an economy

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.185
-and a government that works
for everybody... -Right.

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:27.486
not just the one percent.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.523
And I think our message
resonates with them, as well.

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.525
-(applause, whooping)
-You really have...

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.193
you really have connected
with people

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:35.861
that-that-that
you wouldn't expect.

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:38.063
I mean, young people,
uh, people of color--

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:39.999
you've connected
with so many groups.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.001
And now what's really
interesting to me is,

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:44.203
it recently came out
that you have decided to do

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:46.772
-a Fox News town hall...
-Yeah.

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:49.475
even though, you know,
the DNC made a decision

00:06:49.508 --> 00:06:52.478
to not go with Fox News
for any of the, uh, the debates.

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:54.313
-Yes. -You're breaking
with that line of thinking.

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:57.016
Some would say, "But, Bernie,
why would you go to Fox News?

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.784
It's not a legitimate
news organization."

00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:02.188
-So what are you doing there?
-Well... -(laughter)

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.223
Trust me, I know Fox News.

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:06.392
-(laughter)
-I know who they are,

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.494
and I know the role
that they are playing.

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.563
-Right.
-Uh, on the other hand,

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:13.065
the, uh...
during the last campaign,

00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:17.069
I did a town meeting with a
fellow named, uh, Bret Baier...

00:07:17.102 --> 00:07:19.138
-Yes.
-who did it very fairly.

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:21.140
And, uh, he did it
straightforward.

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:23.609
Believe me, we went over
the ground rules before,

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:24.844
and they kept their word.

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:27.446
So to me it is important

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:31.217
to distinguish Fox News
from the many millions of people

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.118
who watch Fox News.

00:07:33.151 --> 00:07:34.954
-Right.
-And I think it is important

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:37.456
to talk to those people
and say: You know what?

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:40.059
I know that many of you voted
for Donald Trump,

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.560
but he lied to you.

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.128
He told you, for example,

00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.130
he was gonna provide health care
to all people.

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:47.132
Now he wants
to throw 30 million people

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:49.134
off the health care
that they had.

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.370
He told you that he
was gonna give tax reform

00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:53.172
that would not benefit
the wealthy.

00:07:53.205 --> 00:07:56.075
83% of the benefits go
to the top one percent.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:59.044
So I think it is important
to talk to Trump's supporters

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:02.882
and explain to him
to what degree he has betrayed

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:05.451
the working class
of this country

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:08.754
and lied during his campaign
in terms of what he would do.

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:10.089
This has been
an interesting time

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.957
where, you know,
people have said:

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.559
Bernie's running again.

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:16.962
Uh, Bernie doesn't feel old,
but your age is still a number,

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:19.331
-despite what Aaliyah says,
and... -(laughter)

00:08:19.364 --> 00:08:21.333
and some people are saying:
Hey, Bernie...

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.435
do you have any concerns
about your health?

00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:25.471
Are you doing things
to keep yourself healthy

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:27.773
if you were to take
the office of the presidency?

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:30.309 line:0%
Look, all I can say is,
thank God--

00:08:30.342 --> 00:08:32.878 line:0%
this is not wood,
but I'm knocking on it anyhow--

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:34.380 line:0%
-my health is good.
-Right.

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.682
When I was a kid,
I was a long distance runner.

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:38.984
I had a lot of endurance,
and I still do.

00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:40.986
-(woman whoops)
-So I am feeling...

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:42.354
(laughter, cheering, applause)

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:45.824
Not like that. Hey. Hey.

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.593
Sorry. I'm sorry about them.

00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:49.762
-I'm so sorry.
-(laughter)

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.931
You know, and-and I recall
some of these reporters

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.532
who say,
"Well, you're kind of old,"

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:55.601
and they were following me
on the campaign trail,

00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:57.336
and they say,
"Slow down, slow down.

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:58.871
-Right.
-You're moving too fast."

00:08:58.904 --> 00:09:01.807
It really is something that-that
you have used to your credit.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.310
And, um, let's talk
about some of the policies.

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.312
-Good. -You know,
Bernie Sanders is someone

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.846
who has been notorious

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.848
as the person
who can tell it like it is.

00:09:09.881 --> 00:09:11.850
You know? That's one thing
I loved, you were like...

00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:13.619
Howard Schultz, when they said:
Oh, he... he'll agree

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:16.055
to step out of the race
if people like Bernie go away,

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.590
if they put up
a moderate candidate.

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:19.725
And you were like,
"Oh-ho, thank you very much.

00:09:19.758 --> 00:09:22.061
Oh, how nice of him."
But you've always been

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:24.063
a person who seems like
a complete straight talker,

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.931
so let's get into some
of the issues here.

00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:28.233
-Let's talk about health care,
all right? -Good.

00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:30.269
This past week, House Democrats
introduced a bill

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:32.338
to strengthen Obamacare, right?

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:35.007
It was supported by everyone
from Pelosi through to AOC,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.242
but you said, "No. I don't want
to support this."

00:09:37.275 --> 00:09:39.745
You said "I want to come in
and I want to fight

00:09:39.778 --> 00:09:42.381
for Medicare for everyone."
Right?

00:09:42.414 --> 00:09:44.817
And some people might say,
"Okay, but Bernie,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.419
"if everyone is going one way
and you're going your own way,

00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:49.021
"doesn't that go against
what the job

00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:50.990
of the president's gonna be?
Don't you have to sell ideas?"

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.558
Trevor, here is the reality.

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.994
The reality is that bill
will never pass the Senate.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.463
I don't even think it'll be
taken up by the Senate.

00:09:57.496 --> 00:10:01.533
So where we are right now
is a fight for

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.602
how we do two things.

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:05.604
Number one, as a nation,

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:08.641
should we guarantee health care
to all people as a human right?

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:10.442
-Right.
-I think, "yes."

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:14.179
If you do that, how do you do it
in a cost-effective way?

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:16.482
And I think the answer
is overwhelming

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.417
that the only way to do that
is through

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.586
a Medicare-for all,
single-payer program.

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:22.488
Now, I supported Obamacare.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.690
In fact, we got some really
important provisions in it.

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:26.592
But the discussion
that you're raising

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.027
is a little bit academic,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.762
'cause that bill is not gonna
come to the Senate.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.798
What we have to do now is rally
the American people

00:10:32.831 --> 00:10:35.668
and ask the questions why,

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.337
at a time when we have
30 million uninsured,

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.707
we are spending twice as much
per capita on health care

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.976
as do the people
of any other country?

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:45.511
Why do we pay by far

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:47.846
the highest prices in the world
for prescription drugs?

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:49.948
So would you try and bring
the cost of Medicare--

00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:52.151
-medical aid down? -Absolutely.
We got legislation...

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:53.752
Would you bring health care,
prescription drugs...?

00:10:53.785 --> 00:10:57.456
Absolutely. Look,
we have legislation in

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:59.992
that will lower the cost
of prescription drugs

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:01.860
in this country by 50%.

00:11:01.893 --> 00:11:03.729
Is that a radical idea? No.

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:05.864
It's not a radical idea

00:11:05.897 --> 00:11:08.801
because that's what
the rest of world is paying.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.070
We are getting ripped off
by the greed

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:12.838
of the pharmaceutical industry.

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:15.641
In terms of health insurance,

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:19.111
it now costs
about $11,000 per person

00:11:19.144 --> 00:11:22.247
for health care in this country;
family of four, 28,000 bucks.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.216
-That is unsustainable.
-Right.

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:26.085
Twice as much
as the Canadians do.

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:27.820
They guarantee health care
to all people.

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.755
Why is that?
Because the function

00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:31.290
of the current
health care system--

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.858
you're not gonna hear
too many people say this--

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:35.327
is not to provide health care
to all people,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.463
it is to make huge profits

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:40.332
for the insurance companies
and the drug companies.

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:42.534
It is to provide people
like the guy

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.670
who's head of
United Health Insurance

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:48.407
$83 million in compensation
in one year.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.909
It is to allow the five major
drug companies

00:11:50.942 --> 00:11:53.879
to make $50 billion
in profit last year.

00:11:53.912 --> 00:11:55.981
Somebody has got
to take these guys on.

00:11:56.014 --> 00:11:58.183
They're criminals,
people are hurting.

00:11:58.216 --> 00:12:01.653
We need to move toward
Medicare-for-all.

00:12:01.686 --> 00:12:03.655
(cheers and applause)

00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:05.991
One thing you...

00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:07.426
you really do bring up,

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:09.094
and, I mean, health care
just touched on it,

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:10.963
-is income inequality.
-Yes.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:14.900
Um, you have been proud to say,
"Yes, I believe that we need

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:17.436
"to adjust how people earn money
in this country,

00:12:17.469 --> 00:12:19.204
-and how people are taxed."
-Yes.

00:12:19.237 --> 00:12:21.473
Trump has now used this
as a slur against you,

00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:23.108
calling you a socialist,
you know.

00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:24.643
And saying that it means
that we're gonna all

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:27.613
have to drive battery cars
and-and share one road.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:30.883
-But what does it mean to you?
-Good-- Good question.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.384
Thank you for asking it.

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:37.055
It means that economic rights
are human rights, okay?

00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:39.358
I believe, from the bottom
of my heart,

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:42.161
that health care
is a human right.

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:44.296
I believe that in
the richest country

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:46.098
in the history of the world,

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:49.468
we should not have a tax system
which allows Amazon,

00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:51.937
owned by the wealthiest guy
in the world,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.040
to pay zero in federal taxes
last year,

00:12:55.073 --> 00:12:57.876
after making $11 billion
in profits.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:00.078
That is insane.

00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:04.183
To be a democratic socialist
means that we believe--

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:07.352
I believe-- that human rights

00:13:07.385 --> 00:13:11.156
include a decent job,
affordable housing,

00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:13.058
health care, education

00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:15.794
and, by the way,
a clean environment.

00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:18.630
It means
that we cannot allow our kids

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:22.234
to grow up in an environment

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:26.138
-which is increasingly unhealthy
and uninhabitable. -Right.

00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:28.607
We have got to take on
the fossil fuel industry,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.109
move to energy efficiency
and sustainable energy.

00:13:31.142 --> 00:13:33.512
-That's what it means to me.
-I know that you are...

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:35.481
(cheering and applause)

00:13:37.215 --> 00:13:39.318
I know that you are
proposing legislation

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:42.054
arguing that companies
shouldn't be able

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.089
to participate in stock buybacks

00:13:44.122 --> 00:13:46.291
if they don't provide
their workers

00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:48.026
-with a minimum wage
of a certain amount... -Exactly.

00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:50.796
-...and health care and
seven days off in a year. -Yes.

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.831
-Right.
-But let me ask you this.

00:13:52.864 --> 00:13:54.833
Doesn't... Some people
may argue that, like,

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:56.268
"Bernie, that's the government
getting involved

00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:57.402
at the boardroom level."

00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:58.737
Shouldn't you just go in
and say,

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.806
"Hey, let's reverse
the SEC ruling

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:03.242
on how easy it is
for stock buybacks to occur"?

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.310
Well, we-we're in favor
of doing that, as well.

00:14:05.343 --> 00:14:07.880
But I think what we have
right now, Trevor,

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:10.249
is an economic system

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:13.285
where the people on top
in corporate America--

00:14:13.318 --> 00:14:15.220
to a large degree,
not-not totally--

00:14:15.253 --> 00:14:17.289
are just incredibly greedy

00:14:17.322 --> 00:14:19.258
and very contemptuous
of working people.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:22.828
For example, the average CEO
of a major corporation

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:27.199
now makes 300 times more
than his or her employees.

00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:29.034
-Mm-hmm.
-That's really not acceptable.

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:32.938
People are doing buybacks,
stock buybacks,

00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:35.173
uh, while at the same time,

00:14:35.206 --> 00:14:37.743
they're not paying their workers
a living wage.

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.745
So I think it is
the responsibility

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:42.080
of the federal government
to be aggressive

00:14:42.113 --> 00:14:44.449
and to make certain
that the working people

00:14:44.482 --> 00:14:46.585
of this country,
uh, get a fair shake.

00:14:46.618 --> 00:14:48.420
Give you another example.

00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:51.423
Uh, if a company today
is making money

00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:52.624
but they want to shut down

00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:55.527
and move
to low-wage countries abroad,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.496
well, you know,
I got a problem with that

00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:00.365
if they then get online
to get a federal contract.

00:15:00.398 --> 00:15:01.833
-They want a military contract.
-Right.

00:15:01.866 --> 00:15:03.335
So we have a right
to say to them,

00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:04.603
"You want a military contract?

00:15:04.636 --> 00:15:06.371
"You want some federal money?
You know what,

00:15:06.404 --> 00:15:08.707
treat your workers
with respect."

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.009
What's happened
in the last 40 years,

00:15:11.042 --> 00:15:13.211
there's been a massive transfer
of wealth

00:15:13.244 --> 00:15:15.614
from working families
to the top one percent.

00:15:15.647 --> 00:15:18.250
We've got to reverse that trend.

00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:20.252
-(cheering and applause)
-Speaking of a fair shake...

00:15:20.285 --> 00:15:23.455
speaking of a fair shake,
before we're done,

00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:25.524
it's been interesting
that now the Democrats

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:28.260
have used their power
to say to the IRS,

00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:31.430
-"We want to see Donald Trump's
tax returns." -Yeah.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:34.232
Um, people on the right
have responded and said,

00:15:34.265 --> 00:15:35.801
"But where's Bernie's
tax returns?

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.369
"Bernie only released 2014.

00:15:37.402 --> 00:15:39.271
We still don't have
Bernie's tax returns."

00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:41.239
And I was like, "Well,
if Bernie hasn't released them,

00:15:41.272 --> 00:15:42.374
"and Trump hasn't released them,

00:15:42.407 --> 00:15:44.042
there's probably secrets
on both sides."

00:15:44.075 --> 00:15:47.045
-(laughs) -My theory is
Trump doesn't want us to know

00:15:47.078 --> 00:15:49.114
that he's not a billionaire,

00:15:49.147 --> 00:15:51.249
and you don't want us to know
that you are.

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:52.985
(laughter)

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.487
-So, are we gonna see
your tax returns? -You sure are.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.756
Look, um, April 15 is coming.

00:15:57.789 --> 00:15:59.658
That will be the tenth year,

00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:02.427
and we will make them all public
very shortly.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.829
But what's all? What's all?
Just so people know.

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:04.997
-Ten years.
-Ten years of tax returns.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.099
And by the way,
I'm delighted to do that.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.767
Proud to do that.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.303
Hey, Mr. Trump,
you do the same thing.

00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:13.305
(cheering and applause)

00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:15.341
Senator Bernie Sanders,
everybody.
