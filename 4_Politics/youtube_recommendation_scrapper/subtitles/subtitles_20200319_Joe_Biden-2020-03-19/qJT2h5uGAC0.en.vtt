00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.529
This is a chart that has never been seen before.

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:04.359
This one hasn’t either

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:06.290
nor has this one.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.689
None of these have.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.550
That because I made them, along with Matt
here.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.540
My name is Matt Daniels and I'm a journalist
at the Pudding, which is a publication for

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.929
visually led storytelling.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:21.110
Well, mainly Matt made them, I just sent him
a bunch of emails.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.070
These charts are the result of a year long
obsession I’ve had over a very specific

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.660
trend I’ve noticed in music.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:40.850
Men singing really high.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.180
When I listen to the radio, I’ve come to
expect one thing.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.629
Male pop stars exploiting their upper register.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.000
Bruno Mars, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Charlie
Puth, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Adam

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.359
Lavine, the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, Khalid,
Childish Gambino, Frank Ocean, all of One

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.890
Direction, BTS, Chris Martin, One Republic,
and Sam Smith.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.079
I’m not the first person to pick up on this.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.269
In 2015 alone it seemed every guy was singing
high.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.309
There was Jason Derulo

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.770
“Just the thought of you, gets me so high
(so high)”

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.799
Maroon 5

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:15.869
“I’m right here, cause I need a little
love a little sympathy”

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.880
And Justin Bieber

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.770
“Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?”

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.420
But maybe this fact is best illustrated by
this 10 week period on the Billboard Charts.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.270
When The Weekend battled for the top spot
against Justin Bieber

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.540
“And I know she'll be the death of me”

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.100
“What do you mean?”

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.100
And then Himself

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.810
“I only call you when it's half past five”

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.030
until finally his Michael Jackson inspired
voice was was dethroned by Adele’s “Hello.”

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.350
“Hello, It’s Me”

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.540
Really the only way to know if this hypothesis
holds up, though, is to crunch the numbers

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.520
and quantify it.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.541
And that’s where Matt came in.

00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:56.541
It kind of fits a really good mold of the
questions that I really like, where we have

00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:02.850
a cultural question about vocal ranges and
usage of falsetto and music and there is no

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.950
perfect data set for that.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.810
We wanted to make a chart that showed how
prevalent the male falsetto was in pop music,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.510
not just in the last 5 years, but as far back
as we could go.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.819
That meant looking at music streaming services.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.430
Every streaming platform tags the millions
of songs in their respective libraries with

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.700
metadata, but each one does it a little differently.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.879
For example, Spotify has over 35 millions
songs in their library, but their metadata

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.580
is algorithmically driven and pretty broad.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.170
Matt: some of it was around the tempo of music
and how danceable it was or its somber or

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.540
positive tone.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.790
Pandora, on the other hand has a smaller library,
but they are committed to very specific data.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.250
In their case it wasn’t algorithmically
driven.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.050
They were actually having humans review songs
and say what its DNA, or what its genome was.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.470
The result is a library of 2 million songs
with up to 450 individual identifying markers.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.840
So that was interesting to me because falsetto
and vocal range, while could be determined

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.530
by a computer, often lends itself to the human
ear because there is some subjectivity to

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.530
it.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.780
So, we asked Pandora if they had vocal data.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.780
They did.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.780
And they shared it with us.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.110
So do you actually have available the original
dataset that we received?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.970
Oh yeah yeah I can.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.180
Should I just bring that up?

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.299
It's forty two thousand rows.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.930
The first entry is by George P. Watson from
1911

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.680
He was a Yodeler.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.239
One hundred and eight years later and 42,948
rows down we have the iconic high voice of

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.630
Thom Yorke.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.610
Sudden words

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.519
We’ll get to exactly how these are scored
in a bit, but damn that’s a lot of songs.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.329
So what we said was “OK this is great to
see these forty three thousand songs but really

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.569
we only care about songs that charted.”

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.690
So we created a data set of the Billboard
Hot 100, a 28,000 song list of the 100 most

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.200
popular songs in the US every week since 1958.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.230
and we went back to Pandora.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.940
And said we only really want the falsetto
data for these songs, and not only do we want

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.861
the falsetto data, but we also
need data about the register.

00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:31.240
And a few other important things, like the
gender of the person singing.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.251
It’s not just a matter of like putting
into their system and it spits out the falsetto

00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:36.251
data.

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:41.730
We need to match the names of the songs and
the artists names to whatever Pandora has.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.730
Wait.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.500
So you have to do that manually?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.690
We write fancy programs to guess that there's
a match and confirm that there's a match.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.510
So with Matt’s fancy program we matched
20,075 songs.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.040
So the biggest gap in the data is actually
the missing songs that aren't on streaming

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.600
services, but were on the Billboard Hot 100
and did have very valid falsetto data behind

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600
them.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.300
So in 1958 we have data for 50% of the songs
that charted.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.390
In 2018 we have data for 95% of the songs
that charted.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.911
The good thing though is, you think of an
average number one hit from 1958 - that's

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:27.390
more likely to appear on Pandora than a song
that hit number 100 for one week.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.340
When I first sat down with this giant spreadsheet,
I immediately wanted to see how songs that

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.120
I thought had a lot of falsetto had actually
been scored.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.032
The first song that I looked for was Childish
Gambino’s “Redbone.”

00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:45.960
“If you want it, you can have it, ohhhhhh”

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.010
His voice is super high and very memorable.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.150
Not only that, a lot of articles about this
song mentioned it had a lot of falsetto.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.890
To my astonishment, Pandora determined there
was no falsetto in the song, instead they

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.060
said it was just sung in a high register

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.480
This trend was most stark in the hard rock
and heavy metal genres.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.110
Def Leppard’s “Rock of Ages” had a falsetto
score of zero but register score of 9 out

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.110
of 10.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.440
I don't care if it takes all night
I gonna set this town alight, come on

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.560
Knowing this, let’s define what falsetto
and vocal register actually are.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.550
To do that I’ve brought in an actual opera
singer.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.810
Hi I'm Anthony Roth Costanzo and I'm a countertenor
and opera singer.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.180
Prove it.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.020
Perfect, let’s talk about vocal range first.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.800
The voices starting from the bottom in the
classical tradition are bass, baritone, tenor,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.720
contralto, countertenor, mezzo soprano, Soprano.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.710
Countertenor is kind of a catch all term and
it's a range that goes up and down.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.130
Most male pop stars today are tenors.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.010
That means their average range is somewhere
between here and here.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.790
Pandora’s data scores vocal register - which
measures a singers ability to go up and down

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.790
their range consistently.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.850
A super high register

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.360
Pandora rates songs from 0-10 from low to
high.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.900
“Rock of Ages” ranked super high with
a 9 -

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.370
Pharrell’s voice in “Get Lucky” was
given an 8

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.620
“I’m up all night to get some, she’s
up all night for good fun, I’m up all night

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.620
to get lucky”

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.820
As was Elton John in “Crocodile Rock”

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.260
“I never knew me a better time and I guess
I never will”

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.400
So I think it's safe to say that between a
7 and 8 is pretty high on the vocal register

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.400
range.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400
But it's not crazy.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.440
So when these artists want to access even
higher notes

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.380
they’ll likely switch to their falsetto

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.720
register.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.430
Falsetto is an Italian word which means “false
little voice.”

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.210
Falsetto is typically a technique ascribed
to a male singer that switches from their

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.310
chest voice to their head voice.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:53.110
Whenever you're going from chest voice - meaning
the speaking register - to head voice, there's

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.710
often a little break because there are two
different sets of muscles handing off to each

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.260
other, and that's how you yodel right.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.140
[demonstrates yodeling] And that's what yodeling
is.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.090
George, you’re back!

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.760
It’s not just Yodeling.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.580
It happens in pop all the time, though that
transition is often more invisible.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.770
Notice how Freddie Mercury goes from his chest
voice to falsetto when he says the word “decline”

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.910
“A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:31.370
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline”

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.950
Okay so let me just pause for a second and
say that

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.380
“falsetto,” as a term, has been around

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.990
forever, but its definition has changed and
evolved.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.560
Many vocal coaches would say that falsetto
is that breathy, light sound you heard from

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560
Freddie Mercury.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.520
And they say the generic term “head voice”
should describe crisper, reinforced high notes.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.940
A perfect example of that is from this 90s
classic.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:04.892
“I knew I loved you before I met you.

00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:05.892
I knew I loved you.”

00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:06.892
That's amazing.

00:09:06.892 --> 00:09:09.130
I mean you know that's like a really well
integrated instrument.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:14.530
For your average music listener, aka me, the
technical distinction between head voice and

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:20.070
falsetto is less important than the fact that
they both just sound impossibly high.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.390
That brings us again to the scoring system.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.320
A 10 on the Pandora scale is a song that’s
sung entirely in Falsetto

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.000
“Staying alive”

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.030
That’s pretty extreme, and

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.680
according to our data set, it’s also pretty
rare.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.030
So here’s the tricky determination I’ve
got to make.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.880
What falsetto score is enough to really define
a song.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.670
I think a good place to start is a song literally
called “Falsetto”

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:52.030
“Now I got her talking like this, in a falsetto.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:56.310
She’s like oooh oooh baby ahh ah ah”

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.880
Pandora gave this song a 6 - in their ears,
The-Dream only used the technique moderately.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.990
This is where I could split hairs all day.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.921
Because while, yeah, The-Dream doesn’t use
a falsetto the whole time, the technique plays

00:10:08.921 --> 00:10:10.940
does play a central role in the track.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.680
The hook of the song, the most memorable part,
is sung in falsetto.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.680
Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River”
also got a 6.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.530
“Cry me a river (go on and just)
Cry me a river (go on and just)

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.940
Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)”

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.490
So, I’m going to look at songs with a falsetto
above a 5

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.370
If there’s one thing I can’t stress enough,
it’s that this data can be addressed in

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.430
a 1,000 different ways.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.700
To keep things simple, though we’ve separated
falsetto and vocal register as two separate

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.710
data points.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.870
I think this is probably the first chart I
made that just was super simple and just said

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:53.080
all right “What is the average value of
all the songs that charted in a year.”

00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:00.300
First let's focus on vocal register.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:06.180
I was not expecting to see this just a very
clear like march to the top in the late 80s

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.770
The average vocal register for male singer
in 1988 was a 7.1.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:17.910
But as you can see across any time period,
that average never really dropped below 5.4.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:22.490
Because there were so many songs in 1988 that
had a register of 7 or higher, we’re going

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.810
to make this a little bit tougher.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:28.620
I’m going to boost the register to an 8
and only allow songs that made it in the top

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.620
10.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.350
We’ve got a strong hard rock and heavy metal
showing.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.380
“She's got a smile it seems to me”

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.070
There’s my man Phil Collins

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.850
“I'm always right there beside her
We're two hearts”

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.450
I’ve literally never heard this song

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:51.360
“I can rocket 2 u”

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.930
Okay, wow.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.170
If we push the Falsetto score up to a 6, we’re
left with just two songs from 1988.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.270
“Smooth Criminal”
“He came into her apartment

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.250
He left the bloodstains on the carpet”

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.070
and “Nite and Day” by Al B Sure!

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:13.190
“I can tell you how I feel about you night
and day”

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.190
With Nite and Day just barely edging out to
win.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.050
The 1980s blew a high male vocal register
out of the water.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.940
So let’s see how this chart changes when
we just focus on falsetto.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.990
Things start to shift going back from the
1980s to the 1970s - the disco era.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.310
1975 was the highest year for falsetto.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.390
Where 18% of songs had a value over 4.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.440
It also serves as a turning point for the
Bee Gees.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.860
This might be surprising to hear, but before
1975 the Bee Gees’s average falsetto was

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.660
around 0.8.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.510
After 1975 it rose to a 5.5.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.510
And that makes sense.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.470
They had to compete with the likes of Earth,
Wind, and Fire, Ohio Players, Eddie Kendricks,

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:02.620
Curtis Mayfield - all artists whose careers
were defined by their high voices.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.950
I can imagine a record executive in a room
listening to a song and they're like “Yeah

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.620
that's great but you should put some falsetto
in there somewhere”

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.820
It wasn’t until 1976 that their now trademark
falsetto hit number one.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:20.980
“You should be dancing, yeah”

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.970
Looking back at both of these charts, it’s
obvious something shifted after the 1980s.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:31.010
The thing that changed after the 80s is you
have hip hop becoming massively popular.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.779
And today it's the most popular genre.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:39.029
If you look at the average song there just
isn't as many opportunities for for a falsetto

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:41.130
because there's just less singing.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.070
So how do we account for that?

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.890
So I created this toggle that basically said
is there singing in this song which is also

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.890
from the Pandora data, they basically have
a spoken variable.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.660
So first let’s see what happens when we
toggle the singing function for songs in the

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.860
top 10.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.620
1996 and 2015 really shoot up.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.330
Let’s focus on 1996 first.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.130
This was the year Neo-Seoul went mainstream.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.290
Artists like D’Angelo and Maxwell led the
charge.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.220
Their voices were a modern twist on the soul
artists of the 1970s.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.130
I mean just listen to D’Angelo next to Curtis
Mayfield.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.730
“When I first saw you baby
I wanted to die

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.440
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine”

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:29.490
“So In Love, every time we kiss”

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:35.720
2
1996 was a huge year for Falsetto, but so

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.490
was 2015.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.920
And here are maybe your your your ears hearing
the right thing, relative to other years,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.440
2015 was the year of high voices.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.500
Regardless of which toggle we select or which
combination of falsetto and register we choose,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:55.110
we did find this: if a song has falsetto,
whether it’s a 1 or a 10, it’s going to

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.500
chart higher — and longer.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.029
This is true across nearly every year.

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:05.040
Not only that, Top 10 Hits are more likely
to use falsetto.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.660
Take a look at that huge spike in 2015.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:14.430
66% of songs that peaked in the top 10 had
falsetto.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.080
Regardless of the decade, high male voices
are iconic.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.050
From the Frankie Vallie belting Sherry

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:26.380
“Sherry baby”

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.270
To the 70s swagger of Bloodstone’s “Natural
High”

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:40.589
“I'm trying to make something out of nothing
And I don't even know you”

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:41.870
To the Weeknd’s hazy R&amp;B

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:49.770
“None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah”

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.610
It feels like today is very good for the commercial
viability of the high male voice.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.850
And I think that's true if the window of time

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.860
is the millennials' lifetime.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.611
But if you were to talk to your parents or
your parents parents they'd be like Oh you

00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:05.310
think today is good.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.240
In nineteen seventy five it's not even comparable.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.740
The reason why it might feel like a trend
today is because this is all we've ever known.
