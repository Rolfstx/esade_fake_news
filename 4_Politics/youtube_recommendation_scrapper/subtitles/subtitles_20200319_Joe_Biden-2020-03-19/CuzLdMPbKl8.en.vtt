00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.631
Narrator: Ladies and
gentleman the President of

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.900
the United States and
Mrs. Michelle Obama.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.337
(applause)

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:20.046
The President:
Hello, hello, hello.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:20.847
Thank you.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:21.981
Thank you.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:26.986
Thank you.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:31.724
Everybody have a seat.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.827
Well, you can tell what
kind of night this is.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.528
(applause)

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:39.933
That was not the usual
ruffles and flourishes.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:46.673
That was not John Philip
Sousa right there.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.509
(laughter)

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.010
This must be a BET event.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.012
(applause)

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.687
Hello, everybody.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.855
Audience Members: Hello.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.022
The President: Welcome
to the White House.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.190
(applause)

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.425
Female Speaker:
We love you.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.160
The President:
I love you back.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.631
That's why we're
having this concert.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.701
So, over the past eight
years Michelle and I have

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:20.106
set aside nights like this
to honor and celebrate the

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.775
music that has
shaped America.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:27.313
And it's with a little bit
of bitter sweetness that

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:31.251
this is our final musical
evening as President

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.852
and First Lady.

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:37.757
I know.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.325
It's going to
be all right.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.027
(laughter)

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:43.630
(applause)

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.967
It's going to
be all right.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:51.037
And I want to thank BET
for helping us out tonight

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:53.273
to throw a great party.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.441
(applause)

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.948
It's no secret that
Michelle and I love music,

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.584
and we try to share our
passion with the

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:05.585
rest of the country.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.487
But it is important to
note we are not the first

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:11.824
occupants of this house
to fill it with music.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.594
The truth is that
throughout history, the

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:17.630
White House has celebrated
the new and innovative.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.800
It's even been a little
edgy once in a while.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.468
President Chester A.

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:24.604
Arthur was ahead of his
time in inviting the

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:26.940
all-black Fisk
Jubilee Singers.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.509
And their performance
moved him to tears.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.644
(applause)

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:35.882
Teddy Roosevelt welcomed
Scott Joplin because his

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.352
daughter wanted to
hear that new jazz.

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:42.555
And then, guests of the
Kennedys apparently did

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:46.192
the twist in the East
Room, which may not sound

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.394
like a big deal to you,
but that was sort of the

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.729
twerking of their time.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.564
(laughter)

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:52.932
It was --

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.467
(applause)

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.536
-- it was bold.

00:03:56.536 --> 00:04:00.239
There will also be
no twerking tonight.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.475
(laughter)

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:04.444
At least, not by me.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:05.612
I don't know about Usher.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:09.482
(laughter)

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:13.419
But it makes sense because
this is the people's

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.690
house, and it ought to
reflect the amazing

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.793
diversity, and the
imagination, and the

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:24.263
incredible ingenuity that
defines the American people.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.000
And while much of the
music that you will hear

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.971
this evening -- gospel,
R&amp;B, rap, is rooted in the

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.307
African American
experience, it's not

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:35.375
just black music.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.543
This is an essential
part of the

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:38.511
American experience.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:42.482
(applause)

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.923
It's a mirror to who we
are, and a reminder

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.259
of who we can be.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.762
So, with that, I'm
going to stop talking.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.263
Are you ready
to get started?

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.865
(applause)

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:03.002
If so, give it up for
our first performer the

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:06.773
amazing, the
lovely Jill Scott.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:08.141
(applause)

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:15.748
Jill Scott: This song I'm
about to do is dedicated

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:20.553
to all the working
mothers, working wives.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:27.060
Working women
of the world.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.261
Hello, ladies
and gentlemen!

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.664
(applause)

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:37.603
Baby, Mama be back in a

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:43.076

But when I walk by the

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:06.032
/You can cruise on down

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:10.069

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:37.089
(applause)

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.695
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:46.032
Can I get one more?

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:52.672
Okay.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:57.143
Now, we get loose.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:06.853
I'm taking my
freedom,/Pulling it off

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:11.123
the shelf,/Putting it on
my chain,/Wear it around

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:16.262
my neck,/I'm taking my
freedom,/Putting it in my

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:21.267
car,/Wherever I choose to
go,/It will take me far/

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:26.339
I'm livin' my life like

I'm holding onto my own
freedom/Putting it in my

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:49.128
song,/Singing loud and
strong,/Grooving all day

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:53.399
long,/I'm taking my
freedom,/Putting it in my

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.938
stroll/I'll be

(applause)

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.573
Narrator: BET presents
Love and Happiness: An

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.342
Obama Celebration.

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.877
We will return with our
hosts, Regina Hall and

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:14.513
Terence Jade as they take
us through a night of

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:19.218
spectacular performances,
from Common, Usher, the

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:24.156

Janelle Monae, De La Soul,

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:29.762
Jill Scott, Yolanda Adams,

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:33.199

Jesse Williams,
Bradley Cooper,

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:39.372
and Angela Bassett.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:44.810
It's a celebration you
don't want to miss.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.713
From the White House South
Lawn, BET presents Love

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:50.850
and Happiness: An
Obama Celebration.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.619
And now, please welcome
your hosts, Regina Hall

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.021
and Terence Jade.

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:58.257
(applause)

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.128
Terence Jade: Thank you
for having us as your

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.363
hosts for this most
important evening.

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:07.767
Love and Happiness, a
musical experience.

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.101
You look amazing, Regina.

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:10.102
Regina Hall: Thank
you, Terence.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:10.736
Terence Jade: Thank you.

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:12.004
Regina Hall: We are so
honored to be here.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:15.674
Everything about this
first family is historic.

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:18.244
And the BET Network felt
that you deserve an event

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:19.945
to celebrate you for
everything that you have

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:21.547
given us the
last eight years.

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:24.750
And of course, for
your love of music.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.652
Terence Jade: Being able
to call you Mr. President

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:29.155
for two terms, I think I
can speak for everyone.

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:31.157
It's filled us with
enormous pride.

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:34.126
(applause)

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:42.902
As I stand here with
everyone, you can feel it.

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:44.503
(applause)

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:52.078
This standing ovation
takes me back, and reminds

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:55.781
me of some words I heard
back in the day, from the

00:11:55.781 --> 00:12:00.252
late great Tupac who said
"We ain't ready for a

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:02.521
black president."

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:04.990
Regina Hall: Eight years
later, there are children

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.660
who have only known
a black man --

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.828
(applause)

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:11.764
-- as President of
the United States.

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.899
Terence Jade: We were
talking about that back

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:14.600
in the dressing room.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.701
That's no small thing.

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.570
You know, these children
-- no matter where they

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.872
are on the planet, have a
radically different idea

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:21.907
of what you a world leader
can be, and that's

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.710
because of you, sir.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.448
It's kind of a
bittersweet occasion.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:29.915
Regina Hall: Oh, yeah.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:30.316
Oh, yeah.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:30.916
Oh, yeah.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.017
Terence Jade: We're
really going to miss you.

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.419
I mean, this is worse
than -- like, this is --

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.254
Regina Hall: Well, this is
actually worse than when

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.889
BET replaced Free and AJ.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.325
That was devastating.

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:39.725
(laughter)

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:40.292
Terence Jade: Whoa --

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:41.694
Regina Hall: That
was devastating.

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:42.795
Terence Jade: No,
Regina, that --

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:43.729
Regina Hall: Devastating.

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:46.332
Terence Jade: Regina, you
know, if I can recall, you

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:48.367
know, the people that came
after, they were

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:49.568
pretty awesome, too.

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:51.403
You remember --

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:53.305
Regina Hall: Nah.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:54.373
No, no, no.

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:55.407
I love you, Terence.

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:56.175
Terence Jade: I love
you, too, Regina.

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:56.942
I love you, too.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.944
But seriously, Mr.
President, you entered

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.647
the White House a dreamer,
and unbelievably, after

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:04.183
all you've seen, you're
leaving the office more

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.619
optimistic than you
were when you entered.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.355
Regina Hall: For you, sir,
hope was never a slogan,

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.823
but a fundamental
philosophy.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:11.957
A world view.

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:14.593
And we are stronger as a
nation because

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:16.262
of your leadership.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:16.929
Thank you.

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.998
(applause)

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:20.900
Terence Jade:
What a night.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.867
What a room.

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:23.002
Time to jump
into the show.

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:23.502
As you could see --

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:23.802
Regina Hall: Yeah.

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:24.570
Terence Jade: -- tonight
will be an

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.571
evening like none other.

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.373
Please welcome to the
stage -- he wanted me to

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.440
introduce him this way.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:28.941
Regina Hall: Okay.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.442
Terence Jade: The highest
grossing box office

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:33.979
movie star of all
time, Samuel L. Jackson.

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.247

♪ (music playing) ♪

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:48.494
Samuel L. Jackson: Well, well, well.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.361
So, you want
to leave, huh?

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.997
(laughter)

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.933
Just can't take
it no more?

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.100
I get it.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.302
You're a better
man than me, sir.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:14:00.439
You really care about us
and the American people,

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:01.707
and we applaud
you for that.

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:04.376
(applause)

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:08.714
You have been through a
lot, and you've always

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:11.483
remained so cool.

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:13.953
See, I once played a
character named Jules --

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.388
(laughter)

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:18.891
-- in a little movie
called Pulp Fiction.

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.760
Now, that was a man
with ice in his veins.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.397
But after your time in
the White House, sir?

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:28.834
You put Jules to shame.

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.604
Ain't nobody
cooler than you.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.038
You been through
the wringer.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.139
We watched.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.041
Conspiracy theories.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.343
Birth certificates.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.245
Congressional obstruction.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:42.715
They even criticized
you for swatting a fly.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:47.853
A fly!

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:48.854
A fly.

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:53.826
But even as they got mad,
you just kept at it.

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:58.330
And for eight years, you
kept your word, and your calm.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.368
You are the
epitome of cool.

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:07.273
(applause)

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:12.911
Our next performer is
another cool cat, and also

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:15.247
the first rapper that ever
performed on television

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:17.916
from the White House.

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.685
Please welcome Common.

the First Lady are the

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.394
leaders of the people.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:30.863
We have no President that
stood up for the people

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:34.133
the way our President has.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:37.136

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.988
words, and Janelle Monae
gives an

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:11.757
electrifying performance.

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:16.628
(applause)

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.399
Regina Hall: Ladies and
gentlemen, from the hit

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:25.370
show, Grey's Anatomy, or
you probably remember him

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.672
as the humanitarian
recipient from the BET

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:31.710
Awards, please
welcome Jesse L. Williams.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.514
(applause)

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:43.155
Jesse L. Williams: And
another thing.

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:45.290
All right, not tonight.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.292
I'm not going to
do anything crazy.

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:50.462
Tonight is an incredible
night for all of us.

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:52.297
(applause)

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:54.199
It's a big deal.

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.902
It's an opportunity for
all of us to be thankful

00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:58.970
for a few things
in our lives.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.505
Take a break, share
some gratitude.

00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:03.675
And in these last few
months, with you guys in

00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:06.745
the White House, I'd just
like to publicly thank the

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:09.314
Obamas for being such a
great and lasting source

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:10.582
of pride for all of us.

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:11.616
(applause)

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:17.289
Now, we live in a country
so long committed to

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.958
dictating our potential
based on trivialities,

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.693
like skin color, and
gender, and orientation,

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:22.260
and faith.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.763
And we just want to tell
you that we get it.

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:26.264
We know.

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:32.204
We know, all too well,
that despite arguably

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:37.042
irrational hope and
patriotism and pledges of

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:40.478
allegiance, we understand
what you endure, and we

00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:42.614
appreciate the model that
you set, and the ceilings

00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:43.481
that you break --

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:45.517
(applause)

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:49.120
-- demonstrating the
value of leadership, of

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.823
preparation, of
fatherhood, and

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:54.893
dignity -- uphill.

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.328
Well, now, while none of
us can be expected to

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.964
agree with everything a
leader does, we always

00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:01.633
have been inspired by your
intelligence and your

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:04.936
grace throughout, and that
you brought directly

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.171
to this office.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.272
(applause)

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:12.510
Now, your legacy is still
being written, and I, for

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.679
one, believe that you may
have an even greater path

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.748
ahead of you, reaching
back into the communities

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:18.884
where you began, pounding
the pavement for working

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:20.452
people in this country.

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:22.120
Our young folks are
watching, and they are

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.122
setting their
goals accordingly.

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:26.958
Toughness and temerity.

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:30.495
Calm and collected,
intellectual, daring, and

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:34.299
decency -- the examples
that we set, they matter,

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:36.301
and we thank
you for yours.

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:38.169
(applause)

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:42.374
Our next performer, one of
the few beautiful people

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:44.142
who made it onto the
President's official

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:47.178
playlist -- my mix tape
hadn't dropped yet, so I

00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:50.248
missed the deadline
-- technicality.

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:54.452
Please welcome the one,
the only, Miss Janelle Monae.

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:59.124
(applause)

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:01.826
Janelle Monae:
Mr. President.

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:04.062
At this point,
we're family.

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:05.530
I love you, First Lady.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:11.736
I remember singing this
song, and you've given me

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:16.241
hope, like the hope you
had in your eyes when you

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.944
became the President of
the United States of America.

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:22.347
You saw the future.

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.950
Thank you.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:39.898
Smile, though your heart
is aching, smile/Even

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:50.675
though it's breaking/When
there are clouds, in the

00:26:50.675 --> 00:27:04.089
sky you'll get by/If you
smile, through all fear

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:18.903
and sorrow/Smile and may
be tomorrow/You'll find

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:32.384
the sun come shining
through for you

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:45.430
Light up your face, with
gladness/Hide every

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:50.769
trace of sadness

00:27:50.769 --> 00:28:08.453
Although a tear may be
ever so near/'Cause that's

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:21.466
the time you must keep on
trying/Smile, what's the

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:32.477
use of crying/You'll find
that life is still worth

00:28:32.477 --> 00:29:13.084
while/If you, my
darling, smile, smile, smile

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:20.358
(applause)

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:23.394
But you didn't
just stay here.

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:27.232
You were on the camping
trails, and I remember you

00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:28.867
saying these words.

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:30.802
"You can't get too high.

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:33.138
You can't get too low."

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:35.507
So, I wrote a song about
it, and it's called Tightrope.

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:35.807
Are you all ready
for the Tightrope?

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:36.074
(applause)

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:39.544
Are you ready?

00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:44.015
One, two, three.

00:29:44.015 --> 00:29:52.423
Whoa/Another day/I
take your pain away

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:54.792
Some people talk about
ya/Like they know all

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:57.061

they doubt ya/And when you

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:59.397

00:29:59.397 --> 00:30:01.299

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:06.671

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:11.209

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:16.915
'Cause baby whether I'm

I'm still tippin' on it

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:40.238
See I'm not walkin' on

special tribute
to the President.

Mr. President, Mrs. Obama,
on behalf of the entire

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:46.717
Broadway company of
Hamilton, thank you so

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:49.120
much for your
support of our show.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.558
Your legacy, I'm sure,
will warrant a musical in

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.359
the next 100 years.

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.194
I'm positive about that.

00:34:56.194 --> 00:35:00.264
Now, I may not be around
to perform it then, so is

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:02.066
it cool if I try
some of it now?

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:02.834
Okay.

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.469
I wrote a little
something.

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:07.338
Adam, okay.

He is the son of an
immigrant from Kenya/and

the woman from Wichita
dropped in the middle of a

00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:31.896
phenomenon in the
spot/State 50, swifty

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:35.633
shifty, lifting trees
upon cool debris of

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:39.103
calm/Organizing the
senator, he went through

00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:44.075
the door and whoa/Is that
great speech in 2004/And

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:48.112
whoa, world began to
really pay attention to

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:51.916
the top spot could be
his/The people started to

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:55.019
mention/And then there's
Michelle, she's ride or

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:58.689
die/An amazing woman,
right there by his

side/And we watched as his
hope grew/And in two and

President/Uh-oh, guess

who/Barack Hussein Obama,

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:21.546
filled with drama/But man,
we love you like a mama --

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:22.613
Okay, I'm still
working on it.

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:25.550
I'm going to get Lin to
punch it up, I promise.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.485
(applause)

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:34.525
It will be better.

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.427
It will be
better than that.

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:40.731
But in all sincerity,
if I could, I think the

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:43.034
hallmark of your
presidency has been grace,

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:46.771
and this song
speaks to that.

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:52.643
May God's bless and keep
you always/May your wishes

00:36:52.643 --> 00:37:00.084
all come true/May you
always do for others/And

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:09.093
let others do for you/May
you build a ladder to the

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:23.107
stars/And climb on every
rung/May you stay/Forever

00:37:23.107 --> 00:37:35.152
young/And may you
stay forever young

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:41.826
May your hands always be
busy/May your feet always

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:48.199

know what it's like to be

00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:51.795
married to a man who's a
big deal when you're a

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:54.732
pretty big deal yourself.

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:57.134
To be married to a man
who's dedicated his life

00:43:57.134 --> 00:44:00.037
to something bigger than
himself, who's committed

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:04.108
to making the world a
better place, is to live a

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:06.343
life that looks beyond
your own love for each

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:10.080
other, and to imagine a
future beyond your

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.384
own lives together,

You have been a beacon of
light these past eight years.

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:27.831
You have been a paragon of
dignity in the face of the

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:31.235
worst kind of politics --
in the face of a tax on

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:34.204
obstruction, you have been
a steady reminder that the

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:37.841
high road is the only
road worth taking.

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:41.812

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:46.750
Your marriage, your
out-loud love for one

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.020
another has inspired young
people to look to one

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.959
another, even as they look
out at the challenges that

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:58.595
they must face, and the
world that they

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.931
must transform.

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:03.667
I don't have the words to
say how much I'm going to

miss the elegance, the
glamour, the easy intimacy

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:11.308

faced challenges.

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:14.178

you when Barack Obama was

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:50.680
elected President in 2008?

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.616
Because there was an
infectious magic that made

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:55.652
its way around the
world and the country.

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:58.088
I remember, I was with
you two in Missouri, in a

00:50:58.088 --> 00:50:59.523

tent two days

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:00.791
before the election.

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:02.159
It was an honor.

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:05.262
On the actual day, I was
shooting Hangover one.

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:08.265
We were in a hospital in
Los Angeles, and then Zach

around Venice afterwards.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.469

everybody get out of the

horns, and celebrating.

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:28.318
In Las Vegas, it was
Mr. Chow's suite, and he

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:29.786
was having a party when
the results were coming

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.455
in, and we kept rushing in
to look at the television.

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:34.090
So, if we make Hangover
four, you'll stay?

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:37.360

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:33.135
So we decided to chill

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:36.805
Conversation got heavy,
she had me feelin' like

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.941

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:49.685
