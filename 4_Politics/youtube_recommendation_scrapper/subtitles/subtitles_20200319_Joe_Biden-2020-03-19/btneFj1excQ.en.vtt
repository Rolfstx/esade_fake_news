OPRAH WINFREY:  Today...

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.980
JEREMY:  I'm lucky to have sex once or twice a month.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.530
AMY:  When I do give in to Jeremy and we have sex,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.410
I pray that it's over with in two minutes.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.810
JEREMY:  I'm rejected almost every day.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.010
WINFREY:  Are you having enough sex?

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.740
BARBARA:  I definitely think our sex drives are incompatible.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.780
DAVID:  It's not that I don't want to make love to her,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.120
it's that I'm just tired.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.650
WINFREY:  Dr. Phil goes into the bedroom.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.660
ALYSSA:  We had sex three or four times a week.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.320
Now it's been over a year.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.460
Robert has one excuse after another.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.920
WINFREY:  What we're trying to figure out, Phil and America,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.000
what happens within a whole year.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.890
Dr. PHIL McGRAW:  Whatever's going on with you,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.400
you haven't told me.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.210
WINFREY: When sexual appetites don't match--big problem--next.

[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570
Thanks, everybody.  Let's--let's cut to the chase.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.710
How much sex a week do you have?

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740
Unidentified Woman: ...(Unintelligible).

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.410
WINFREY:  Would I what?

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.080
Unidentified Woman:  Would you rephrase that to who much sex

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.150
you have a year, because I could answer that.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.780
WINFREY:  OK.  The answer would be what?

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.020
Unidentified Woman: Twice.

Unidentified Woman: No!

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.890
WINFREY:  OK.  OK, twice a year.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.560
Well, this is going to be a very interesting show, America.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.960
Is it enough for you?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.760
That's the question Phil wants to know,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.530
but not enough for your partner.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.330
Dr. Phil's here to help figure out what to do when your

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.040
sexual appetites don't match.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.880
This is a big issue, I hear, for millions of couples,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.540
when one of you wants it more than the other.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.580
OK. So since having children--this happens to a lot of

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.810
people--Amy never wants to have sex with her husband.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.050
Jeremy says he can't stand living

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.150
with the rejection much longer.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.060
AMY:  Jeremy and I have been married for six years.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.790
We were high school sweethearts.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.320
We were so in love.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.200
People constantly commented to us, you know,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.300
`You guys, God, can't keep your hands off each other.'

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.700
When we were first married,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.140
we were having sex at least once a day.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.230
JEREMY:  Once we had children, we stopped making love.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.170
I'm lucky to have sex once or twice a month.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.610
AMY:  I can't just flip a switch and being a mom

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.340
to becoming the sexy wife that he wants me to be.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.780
I can't do it.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.460
JEREMY:  I have a very high sex drive.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.880
I could make love to Amy every day if she'd let me.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.550
And if it was up to her,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.780
she says she would never have sex again.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.120
AMY:  When I do give in to Jeremy and we have sex,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.160
I pray that it's over with in two minutes.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.890
I work full-time.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.670
I go to school, and when I come home at night,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.240
I walk in the door, give the kids a hug.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.530
Come on, let's clean up this mess, you guys.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.270
Looks like a tornado went through.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.850
I'm exhausted, and Jeremy wants attention from me.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.790
This is not the '70's.  I mean, I work, too.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.270
JEREMY:  She never wants to hug.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.710
She never wants to kiss.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.120
She just does not want to touch me at all.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.230
AMY:  The truth is I wish Jeremy would just leave me alone.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.080
He will walk past me and grab me.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.730
It just turns me off.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.670
The kids are right there, and I don't like that.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.470
After I had children, my body became like a road map

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.910
with stretch marks and purple varicose veins.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.680
I can't ever imagine myself feeling sexy

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.090
or looking sexy ever again.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.750
JEREMY:  When I tell Amy that she looks beautiful,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.120
she's like, `No, I don't,' you know,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.420
`I look like a cow.'

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.790
She just has it set in her mind that

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.660
she's not attractive at all.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.320
My dream would be for Amy to come home

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.690
and want to make love to me.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.360
I'm rejected almost every day.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.870
AMY:  Jeremy's told me if I don't please him,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.040
he will find someone who will.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.000
I do feel bad for Jeremy,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.640
and I wouldn't know what to do if I was in his shoes.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.380
WINFREY:  So Jeremy has threatened to find

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.610
affection elsewhere, right? Somewhere else?

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.350
You've threatened.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.250
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.880
Dr. JEREMY: Yeah.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.190
McGRAW:  Tell me what it is that turns you off about sex.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.290
You said, `I--I know it's not natural to do that.'

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.160
What is it about it that really bugs you?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.530
AMY:  Ever since I had kids, to me it's dirty.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.060
It's just--moms don't do that.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.770
Dr. McGRAW:  Moms don't do that.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.830
AMY:  That's how I--my perspective has changed.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.770
Before kids, we didn't have any problem at all.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.440
We couldn't keep our hands off each other.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.910
Then once I had children, it was like now I'm a mom.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.480
I'm not sexy.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.450
I don't--the grabbing and the groping

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.560
and the affection is just dirty to me anymore.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.050
Dr. McGRAW: And-and...

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.320
AMY:  And I can't get past that.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.530
I know it's a problem, and I know it's not right.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.530
I don't want to feel like this.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.700
I want it to be like it used to be.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.700
He could touch me and I'd just get this tingling

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.130
or I'd get so excited to see him,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.400
and then--but once I've had kids,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.470
it's like the kids are in the back of my mind.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.470
My work's in the back of my mind.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.320
Schoolwork.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.790
I have so much in my mind that I just--I can't push it all

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.510
to the side and just switch

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.890
and I'm the wi--I'm the sexy wife like,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.330
you know--I can't do it.  I can't relax at all.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.620
Dr. McGRAW:  Well, that--that's a paper tiger.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.400
I'm going to come back to that in a minute.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.600
But, Jeremy, how do you feel about this?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.560
JEREMY:  It's frustrating.  It really is.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.380
Like Amy was saying, we were high school sweethearts.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.680
We--we've never had a problem sexually.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.310
And then we got married--you know,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.050
we just couldn't wait to get married because

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.750
we wouldn't have to sneak around, you know.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.420
It was just--you know, we'd have our own,

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.120
you know, house together; it would be just great.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.120
And it was until we had our children.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.360
And then it just went downhill.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.520
Dr. McGRAW:  Now listen very carefully to my questions here.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.130
Do you like your husband?

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.300
AMY:  I love my husband.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.500
Dr. McGRAW:  That isn't what I asked you.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.240
I said listen very carefully. Do you like your husband?

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.770
AMY:  Yes, I like my husband.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.600
Dr. McGRAW:  You like him.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.370
He's a nice guy. He's...

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.440
AMY:  Um, he's grouchy.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.740
Dr. McGRAW: Yeah.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.840
AMY:  I think he's grouchy a lot.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.250
Like--I think he's grouchy a lot of the time.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.450
But I think a lot of that's because of me...

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.220
WINFREY: Uh-huh.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.890
AMY:  ...because I'm not giving in.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.560
McGRAW:  Yeah, that'll make a guy grouchy.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.030
It will.  It'll make a guy grouchy.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.400
Dr. McGRAW:  I mean, it will.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.930
WINFREY:  OK.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.200
WINFREY:  OK, but the answer to the question

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.660
is you do--you like him.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.460
AMY: Yes.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.000
WINFREY:  OK.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.630
Dr. McGRAW:  `But.'  You said I like him, but...

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.800
AMY:  Right.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.440
Dr. McGRAW:  `But's' a big word in my vocabulary.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.240
JEREMY:  She says that I need to do more around

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.610
the house as far as helping with the kids,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.820
doing the laundry, doing the dishes.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.980
And I feel I do a lot around the house,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.620
but she says I need to do more.  And--and that's...

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.860
AMY:  It's not equal.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.690
I feel that we both go to school,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.890
we both work full-time, we're both parents.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.920
It should be split down the middle.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.270
Dr. McGRAW:  Yeah, but here--here's my question.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.600
Why are you not interested in having sex?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.330
It--you're either not interested in it

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.970
because it feels dirty and you think

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.530
that it's unnatural and immoral,

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.350
or it's because he doesn't help around the house

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.670
and you've got too much else to do.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.910
Those are two very different things,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.280
and I'm trying to figure out whether one's just

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.480
a bunch of justification to support the other

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.380
or it's one vs. the other.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.720
I mean, what--what--what is the--what is up here

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.620
that all of a sudden--because you're an intelligent woman.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.920
I can tell from talking to you.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.150
You--you--you have the ability to reason.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.030
You've got to know that we're not all

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.840
a bunch of perverts because we still have sex.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.320
AMY:  Right.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.100
Dr. McGRAW:  We do still have sex, don't we, some of us?

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.250
There's just--there's just--this isn't

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.690
an epidemic in the room, is it?

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.580
Because if it is, I'm getting out.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.990
I mean, you--I mean, you've got to know

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.120
that it's--that this--that this is kind

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.550
of a natural thing or we wouldn't last very long, right?

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.880
AMY:  I know it's a natural thing,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.630
and it's just--it doesn't do anything for me.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.400
I don't enjoy it.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.890
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  Now that's a third reason.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.360
I'm serious.  I'm just trying to...

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.990
AMY:  I have a...

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.360
Dr. McGRAW:  I'm trying to get you...

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.000
AMY:  I have a--I have a lot...

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Dr. McGRAW:  I'm just trying to get you to think through it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.010
You said it's dirty.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.670
He irritates me because he doesn't do things

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.830
around the house.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.170
I'm really tired from work,

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.200
and I don't get anything out of it.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.380
Now I mean...

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.660
AMY:  I know.  I could go on and on, probably.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.080
I mean...

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.840
Dr. McGRAW:  There's more.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.520
AMY:  No, I--I think that just it--I think all that

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.380
adds up to going to bed at night and trying

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.050
to lay down and I'm mad because he didn't help

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.460
around the house or, you know, I'm tired because

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.010
I had a bad meeting at work, school went bad,

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.500
I--you know, got a lot of schoolwork to do.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.470
Maybe all that's pushing on me,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.300
that I can't just get in the mood.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.560
Dr. McGRAW:  And--and--and you--you can imagine

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.150
if we wrote down that internal dialogue about

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.790
what you're saying to yourself about this throughout

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.960
the day, there's no other possible inco--outcome, is there?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.690
AMY: No.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.090
Dr. McGRAW:  I mean, with all the things you're

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.730
saying--it's dirty, I'm tired, he irritates me,

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.230
I--you know, all of these things, you go through there,

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.470
it's like--and isn't that what you mean by flip the switch?

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.100
AMY:  Yeah.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.340
Dr. McGRAW:  I can't talk to myself 10 hours

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.410
a day about how this is not a good thing

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.050
and then go in there and do it.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.050
And that's what you call flipping the switch, right?

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.010
AMY:  Yes, yes.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.650
Dr. McGRAW:  You can't expect me to program myself

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.150
negatively all day and then get motivated

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.720
about being with you at night.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.620
AMY:  Right.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.050
Dr. McGRAW:  And that's as much a part of it

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.990
as it is him just grabbing you and saying,

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.020
you know, `Come on, baby,' you know.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.160
AMY:  That's what he does, sometimes.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.020
Sometimes I'm like, `Can't you be romantic?'

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.230
Dr. McGRAW:  Yeah, I mean, I know what he does.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.160
I got--I got it.  I'm the guy.  I understand that.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.660
And so, you know, partially it's that

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.970
you could use a little better technique...

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.010
JEREMY:  Well, it...

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:09.700
Dr. McGRAW: ...OK?

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.400
JEREMY:  Any--any time I--I try to--to be romantic with her,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.770
i--it's right away.  `I know what you want.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.910
You can go ahead and stop now.  I know what you want.'

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.770
You know, it's--you know, we'll be laying

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.690
on the couch watching TV and I'll be, you know,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.840
`Honey, let me rub your back.'

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.410
She's `Well, that's as far as it's going.'

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.110
AMY:  But...

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.520
Dr. McGRAW:  Well, she's pretty much right, isn't she?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.920
Because aren't you pretty much like a crazed dog

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.830
at that point?

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.990
I mean, it's like--well--well not,

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.360
I mean, really, you start rubbing her back...

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.930
JEREMY:  Yes.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.930
Dr. McGRAW:  ...you're thinking, OK,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.290
that went OK, so, you know, let's...

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.490
JEREMY:  When--when you do it maybe once a month,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.600
it--it's hard not to.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.360
Dr. McGRAW:  But that's what I mean.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:42.940
It gets where...

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.860
JEREMY:  It's hard not to.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.400
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.770
Dr. McGRAW: Yeah.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.430
AMY:  But I know--he never just rubs my feet

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.860
or my back just to be nice.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.170
WINFREY:  OK.  A lot of women are afraid

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.470
to be affectionate because the slightest little gesture...

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.360
WINFREY:  ...gets them all barking.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.140
Dr. AMY:  Gets him--yeah--all worked up.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.420
McGRAW:  And--and I'm saying that--and I'm saying

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.350
when you are absolutely sex-starved

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.920
and crazed, that's pretty right.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.530
McGRAW:  You know?

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.650
WINFREY:  OK.  I--I got your point.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.290
WINFREY:  I hear you.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.070
Dr. McGRAW:  Isn't that--and you admit that, don't you?

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.900
JEREMY:  That is correct.  I mean, she can walk by

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.060
and just give me that look

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.390
and I'm just ready right now, you know.  I mean, it's...

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.960
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  And that's not flattering to you at all.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.140
AMY:  It--I can't say it's not--I mean, I--I like

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.830
the fact that he wants me all the time,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.520
and I probably like the fact that I can shoot

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.780
him down all the time.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.420
I don't like--I don't want to be like that.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.760
I just--I just want this fixed.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.430
I mean, there's plenty of women out there that

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.360
have more stress in their life than me and their

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.660
sex life is fine.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.730
So my whole thing is what's wrong with me?

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.670
WINFREY:  We're--we're going to finish with Amy and Jeremy...

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.500
Dr. McGRAW:  All right.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.040
WINFREY:  ...when we come back.  We'll be back.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.140
♪♪

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.670
♪♪

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.500
WINFREY:  We were saying during the break that

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.730
Amy represents literally millions of wives--I know,

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.110
we hear from you--who feel that they're just not

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.170
interested in having sex with their husbands.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.340
They love their husbands.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.650
I mean, when I went to the gynecologist--I do go,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.680
you know--the la--last time I was there,

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.350
she was telling me I should do a show about it;

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.810
that's one of the reasons why we are--because it's like

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.700
an epidemic of young women who love their husbands,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.020
Phil, they love their husbands,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.300
they just are no longer interested in sex.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.570
Dr. McGRAW:  OK, but now--and I understand

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.940
it's awful easy to just kind of sweep that all

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.040
into one category.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.010
But you still have to do differential diagnosis.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.280
There are some that it is a hormonal situation.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.250
It is a biochemical situation,

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.180
and then there is a whole 'nother group within

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.220
the category of women who don't want to have sex,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.460
a--or men who don't want to have sex,

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.130
for that matter, that it is a psycho-social situation.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.370
It is relational, it is a function of what's going on.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.030
It doesn't have anything to do with the chemistries

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.000
or the plumbing or anything of the sort.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.600
And there are legitimate groups in both categories,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.110
and what I always do in terms of differential

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.480
diagnosis is go to the simplest explanation first...

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.720
WINFREY:  OK.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.550
Dr. McGRAW:  ...and rule that out if there

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.280
is--i--if you can do that.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.450
WINFREY:  OK.  What's the simplest explanation?

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.590
Dr. McGRAW:  Well, in this situation with Amy,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.130
you've given us lots of things that tell me

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.420
that it wouldn't make any difference where

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.260
you were biochemically or hormonally

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.800
because you're saying,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.390
`I've made some choices in my life.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.910
I've chosen to have about three lives going at one time.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.040
I'm a mother.  I'm a wife.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.410
I'm a student and I work.'

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.910
And when you make the choices,

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.910
you live with the consequences of that,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.880
and it may be that you've put yourself in a situation

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.980
where, at the end of the day,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.380
you just don't have anything else to give.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.550
You just--you just smooth out.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.450
I mean, you've been to work.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.360
You've been to school.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.200
You've come home and done your other job,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.660
which is kids, and I noticed on the tape,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.930
first thing you did was walk in,

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.460
let's cl--let's pick this place up,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.960
looks like a tornado came through here.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.600
So the door wasn't even shut and you were into

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.980
your next job, your next role,

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.080
and you wind up at the end of the pecking order,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.470
so there's just not anything left there.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.640
And then along the way, you decide,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.310
`This is really dirty.  I am now a mom,'

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:23.190
and so that kind of is an umbrella over the whole thing.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.590
Now I would want to work through those things

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.300
before I started taking pills or patches...

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:28.880
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.430
Dr. McGRAW:  ...or you know, something else, really.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.330
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.370
Dr. McGRAW:  I would want to rule those out.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.090
WINFREY:  Then--then--then my point also, too, is--and

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.810
I hear this a lot because I've been talking

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.960
to women for 16 years now on the show--that

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.210
if you put your husband at the bottom of the

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.000
pecking order--women put their husbands--spouses

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.120
at the bottom of the pecking order

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.550
and then don't know why the marriage isn't working.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.440
Dr. McGRAW:  Yeah.  And--and--and men are the same way...

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.020
McGRAW:  ...only worse.  I mean, men--men are really worse.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.910
WINFREY:  Yeah, men, too.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.610
WINFREY:  Both spouses do it.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.610
Dr. McGRAW:  So I'm not trying to pick

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.580
on one gender or the other.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.650
But in this situation,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.200
you're the one that is pulling back,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.720
and I--and I--and I want to be sure

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.750
that we--that we cover some certain things here.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:09.030
Number one, do you understand what you are

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.790
predicting in this marriage with this behavior?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.860
I mean, what you're setting up to happen

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.400
in this marriage with this behavior,

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.000
do you--I mean, do you really expect Jeremy

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.890
to be celibate from 27 through however long

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.390
he's together?

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.790
Do you think this is going to work?

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.460
AMY:  No, I don't think it's going to work.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.590
That's why I just do it sometimes to make him happy.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.430
Dr. McGRAW: OK.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.230
AMY:  To satisfy him.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.230
Dr. McGRAW:  A--and, Jeremy, am I right, I mean,

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.340
are you willing to be non-sexual,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.830
asexual the rest of your life?

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.210
JEREMY:  No, not at all.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.370
I mean, I--I love my wife.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.010
She's the one I want to be with,

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.240
and I want her to want me.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.340
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  And--and--and so you understand,

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.750
you're sending a message that is going to say,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.880
you know, you can either--we can either have an active,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.920
intimate life, or we can't.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.950
And when you send that message,

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.120
you choose the consequence that goes with it.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.060
Are you trying to tell him to leave?

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.260
AMY:  No, absolutely not.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.790
Dr. McGRAW:  Do you want him to leave?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.420
AMY: No.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.030
Dr. McGRAW:  Do you expect him to stay

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.530
under the current conditions?

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.410
AMY:  I'd like him to, but I don't know.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.440
I--we've sat up many nights and talked about it,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.840
and I told him, I was like,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.780
if there was something I could take to make

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.240
me get aroused or feel something, I would.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.450
But I just don't.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:29.090
And I don't know what's causing it.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.420
I don't know if it's the stress or it's something else.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.250
Dr. McGRAW:  See, the...

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.380
WINFREY:  I thought he put it pretty well.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.550
You don't---there's nothing left.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.250
If you're going to work...

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:37.920
AMY: But...

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.620
WINFREY:  ...and going to school

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.050
and coming home and having to be a mom, you're tired.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.160
Dr. McGRAW:  And listen, I--understand what I'm getting

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.320
ready to say.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.360
You're not doing something wrong here.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.730
It--it--don't feel like that you're inadequate

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.840
or in trouble.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.830
What you're saying is,

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.580
`I don't want to feel this way, but I do.'

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.170
AMY:  Yeah.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.460
Dr. McGRAW:  So, I mean, it's not like you--you--you've

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.600
done something wrong and you need to be punished

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.370
or ridiculed here in some way.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.790
And I also hear you saying `I have a willing spirit.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.520
I--I--I want to work on this.'

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.830
And the first place you have to turn--and

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.300
this is--this is just so important.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.900
We--we've talked a lot in weeks past about internal dialogue.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.300
And I'm telling you, when you talk to yourself

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.240
all day long and set yourself up for an outcome,

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.640
it is a hugely powerful control in your life.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.740
You have to be willing to challenge what you're saying

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.050
to yourself about this and get rid of the things

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.350
that are misleading you.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.320
AMY:  Yeah, I just don't know how to stop worrying

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.750
about the kids and the housework

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.360
and--it's like never-ending.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.330
Dr. McGRAW:  That's not--let me tell you where you--where

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.160
I think you need to go here, because it's not about

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.500
stopping to be concerned about those things.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.500
It's about balance.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:53.870
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.400
Dr. McGRAW:  And it's about the spirit with which you

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.010
enter the relationship.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.080
It's about the spirit with which you enter this.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.120
And--and here's the spirit.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.250
I've said that the formula for success in

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.680
a relationship is that the quality will depend

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.850
on how well that relationship meets the needs

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.650
of the two people involved.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.300
And so what you have to do is you have to say,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.790
`I want to look at Jeremy's needs as legitimate,

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.600
and I want to ask myself is there something

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.530
I can do to meet those?'

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.030
And, Jeremy, you have to look at Amy's needs and say,

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.340
`I'm going to consider these to be legitimate.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.240
What can I do to help her with these thoughts

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.570
and these feelings?'

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.910
It's all about the spirit with which you come

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.350
into the relationship of saying,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.670
`I--I want to find a way to make this work'

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.510
rather than just ignoring it or being--because

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.390
it's not what he wants, you turn away from each other.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.590
You know he's upset because of what you're not doing,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.450
so you turn away from him instead of turning towards

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.900
each other to talk about this and discuss it.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.770
And then you have to challenge your thinking.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.690
Is this true? You say sex is dirty once you've had a child.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.680
Is that true?

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.360
AMY: No.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.850
Dr. McGRAW:  You know that's not true,

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.910
so stop telling yourself that.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.410
Is it in your best interest?  It's running your husband off.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.250
It doesn't get you what you want,

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.700
because it's running your husband off.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.610
So, I--I mean, all of those things go together

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.460
to make you able to evaluate your thinking

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.760
and change the spirit with which you do this.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.460
And you have to be patient.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.200
If I say, OK, go home with a willing spirit,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.200
you can't just dog-pile her in the foyer.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.070
You know, you--you've got to be patient.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.150
You've got to be patient and work through this.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.970
WINFREY:  Dog-pile her in the foyer.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:47.080
Don't do that. Next, what to do when it's your husband

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.450
who doesn't want sex.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.420
We'll be right back. Dog-pile her in the...

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.220
♪♪

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.330
♪♪

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.720
WINFREY:  Talking sex with Dr. Phil today.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.790
Are you a once a week, a once a month

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.850
or once a year kind of person?

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.730
Dr. Phil is answering couples' sex questions.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.370
Debbie from Minnesota wrote,

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.430
`Could you please do a show on husbands

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.200
who do not want to have sex?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.450
My husband, Frank,

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:17.480
and I have had sex maybe six times in 22 years.'

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.540
Audience: Oh!

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.140
WINFREY:  `I'm at the end of my rope.'

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.550
I can understand why.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.770
`I want to know if other women have this problem

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.390
or if I'm the only one.'  Six times in 22 years.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.560
Debbie, you're not alone.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.830
We heard from hundreds of women who say they want it

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.270
and their husbands don't.  Hard to believe.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.570
We thought, you know, men always wanted it.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.130
Not so says Alyssa.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.100
Her husband, Robert,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.600
hasn't been intimate with her in over a year.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.670
She's tired of the excuses.  Look at this.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:49.580
ALYSSA:  Dr. Phil, what does a woman do when it is the

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.280
man who doesn't want sex?

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.620
My husband Robert and I have been married

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.950
for six years and have a three-year-old daughter.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.620
I have always been the one initiating sex.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.990
When we were dating, we had sex three or four times a week.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.060
Then it was down to once a month.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.960
Now it has been over a year.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.430
Robert has one excuse after another.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.270
I told him I can't take his rejection anymore

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.430
and I want to separate.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.370
Now after years of me nagging,

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.600
he finally thinks we need help.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.740
But I have built up a wall so high,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.430
I do not know how to break it down.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.340
He's a wonderful man, but I need to be loved.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.510
I'm afraid of having a life with no sexual contact.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.450
What do I do? Sincerely, Alyssa.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.910
WINFREY:  Well, Robert says he's just now realizing

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.050
how important sex is to a relationship.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:34.490
ROBERT:  Yeah.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.780
Dr. McGRAW:  And she's been complaining

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.490
about this for six years.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.250
ROBERT:  Yes.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.530
Dr. McGRAW:  And you're just now figuring out...

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.850
ROBERT:  Ultimatums.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.690
Dr. McGRAW:  I mean, really, I--you know, I'm sorry.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.510
I just don't believe that.  I--I think...

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.370
WHITE:  You said ultima--did you say ultimatums?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.730
ROBERT:  Yeah.  She--she wants to leave,

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.400
or she's talked about leaving, so...

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.770
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  That's what you understand.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.440
ROBERT:  There you go.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.630
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  You understood before

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.240
that it was important to her.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.080
ROBERT:  Absolutely.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.220
Dr. McGRAW:  It's just now she put some teeth

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.180
into it and got your attention.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.650
ROBERT:  Yes.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.440
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  So--but--and so now you're saying

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.850
all of a sudden you want to?

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.190
Or all of a sudden now you're just willing to?

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:15.370
ROBERT:  I think I always put too much emphasis

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.960
on other things than sex in the relationship.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.790
Putting family and work and everything

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.410
that I provide for the family,

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.850
I always thought came first before that part, you know.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.570
That was like icing on the marriage, you know.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.430
Dr. McGRAW:  But--but--but these

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.510
are not mutually exclusive things.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.850
I mean, you say you put emphasis on family

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.570
and work and money and all that,

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.540
but you do go to bed at night, right?

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.180
ROBERT:  Absolutely.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.690
Dr. McGRAW:  And you don't work while you're in bed.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.240
ROBERT:  Right.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.560
Dr. McGRAW:  And so you're there.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.730
The two of you are alone.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.530
Door shut. You're there.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.870
And, I mean, it's just not natural that

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.740
you're just laying there thinking about

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.970
work or--or something.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.350
What--what is it you don't like about it?

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.550
What is it that's unappealing to you?

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.450
ROBERT:  Sex itself you mean?

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.210
Dr. McGRAW: Yes.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.950
ROBERT:  I love sex, I--and there's nothing wrong

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.150
with that at all.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.390
It's just--I think both people have to be in the right

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.020
frame of mind to be in that situation, to be,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.060
you know, sharing that--that time with each other.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.460
If it's not heartfelt,

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.870
then why--why are you doing it, you know?

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.100
Dr. McGRAW:  Well, don't you think in six years

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.300
you would have kind of worked your way over there?

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.610
ROBERT:  Yeah.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.470
Dr. McGRAW:  No, I'm serious.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.400
I mean, you say you got to be in the right frame of mind.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.810
I--I'm just--I--I just--I don't get--I--I--and

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.380
I'm not--I'm not trying to be hard on you.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.180
I'm trying to understand what your telling yourself

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.920
for six years about this.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.660
What--what--what--what do you say about this?

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.350
WINFREY: Alyssa.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.860
ALYSSA:  Well, I--I don't know what the problem is, either.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.600
I've tried for a long time to understand what's

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.460
going through his mind.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.380
The main problem is that now that it's been

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.980
so long--and you know, when we--before we got married,

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.340
you know, it was--we did it quite frequently,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.470
but then it just started to dwindle away and he would say,

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:17.310
`Well, I--you're really special to me

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.310
and I think sex is--should be saved until we're married.'

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.580
And so then we got married,

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.550
and the wedding night came and went,

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.280
and the honeymoon came and went,

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.420
and I was just--you know,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.650
sometimes I wish I could have said,

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:35.160
`OK, there's a problem here, and I need to move on,'

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.130
because I--but I didn't realize, I guess at that time,

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.680
nor did I express to him right after we were married,

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.600
that that was really important to me,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.050
because I wanted to make this marriage work.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.730
And--and after reading several books

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.980
and--and watching several episodes of OPRAH,

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.410
I realized finally, about last fall,

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.700
that I can only make myself happy,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.200
and if he's not helping in making the marriage work

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.640
and everything, then I've got to go,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.740
and that's why I said I'm leaving,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.550
because I just--I don't know what's wrong,

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.580
and I've asked him every question I could ask,

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.910
and--and it just--and now that I've said that,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.780
he's kind of turned around and said,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.790
`Oh, well, OK, let's do it.'

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.750
And--and I--now I feel like,

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.120
`Well, why do you want to do it now?'

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.590
You haven't wanted to--you know,

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.830
you haven't had much interest in such a long time.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.030
Dr. McGRAW: Yeah.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.800
ALYSSA:  So why now?

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.660
Dr. McGRAW:  Well, really, Robert,

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.470
I--what's--what--what--what's up with all of this?

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:45.010
I mean, you--you're saying you just have

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.010
to be in the right frame of mind and all,

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.670
but you're saying, honeymoon and in the time after,

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.340
you weren't in the right frame of mind

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.240
and then for six years you haven't been

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.340
in the right frame of mind.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.650
It is--I mean, what's missing here?

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:02.020
ROBERT:  I think a--a willing partner, you know,

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.450
on her end as well.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.760
I mean, it's not always--it's not--it's

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.890
a painted picture of a constant, you know,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.660
her always, you know, asking me for that

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.340
and me turning her down.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.930
It's--it's really not been that way.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:21.840
It's--it's been more a scattered type

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.110
of relationship where we--we will make love

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.020
to each other and then we'll go a long period

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.510
of time without, and then we'll make love.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.580
WINFREY:  Year's a--would you say a year's

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.620
an extraordinary time?

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.460
ROBERT:  A year is way--I mean, way over...

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.510
WINFREY:  So what we're trying to figure out,

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.250
Phil and America, we're all trying to figure out here,

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.750
is what happens within that period of time of a year?

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.920
Because you had said, you know,

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.170
it's about getting together,

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.360
and being in the right frame of mind.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.530
So within a whole year, January to December,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.700
you weren't in the same frame--we're just

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.100
trying to figure out what's up with that.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.400
ROBERT:  Well, that should be directed here.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.450
We should--I think she has the answer for that, actually.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.820
ALYSSA:  In the last year, he has tried to initiate

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.690
a couple of times, but, as I said, in my letter,

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.340
I don't want it anymore.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.560
So now I've--now I guess it's my problem.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.360
That's why I wrote, because I need--I feel

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.630
like I need some direction.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.250
Dr. McGRAW:  Listen, I--you know,

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.400
I ran into a couple not long ago that had

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.170
been married 52 years.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.010
And I said what's your secret?

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.670
And she had a really great answer.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.040
She said, `We just never fell--fell out of love

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.480
at the same time.'

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.610
And I thought that was really a--a great observation,

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.350
because you do have ups and downs.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.680
You--you do yin and yang within a relationship.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.950
But the--the thing that I'm--I'm trying to--to

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.590
get you guys to understand here is my belief is

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.990
if you've got a good sexual relationship,

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.460
it's about 10 percent, and if you don't,

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.000
it's about 90 percent.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.630
WINFREY:  Right.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:54.500
Dr. McGRAW:  Because if you don't,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.640
somebody's feeling rejected,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.670
somebody's feeling hurt,

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.350
somebody is--is going to be really shut down

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.180
and--and backed up about it.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.350
Do you two--do you love your husband?

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.080
ALYSSA:  I do.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.810
Dr. McGRAW:  You do.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.910
You--you have--you have good feelings

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.290
about him as a person, as a human being?

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:13.850
ALYSSA:  I do.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.980
Dr. McGRAW:  And are they--are--are they feelings

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.690
more than just `I kind of like you'?

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.690
I mean, you really--you--you--you have

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.020
a special feeling for him.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.790
ALYSSA:  Yes, I do.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.590
Dr. McGRAW:  That hasn't gone.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.260
ALYSSA: No.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.230
Dr. McGRAW:  Whatever's going on with you,

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.610
you haven't told me, Robert.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.030
I mean, I don't--I don't know what it is,

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:32.230
and maybe you don't know what it is,

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.140
so you don't know how to--how to put words to it.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.830
But whatever it is, you haven't told me what it is.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:41.010
And--and just threatening to leave won't cure

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.690
that problem, whatever it was.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.060
I mean, whatever keeps you from being motivated

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.050
sexually to be with your wife,

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.820
whether you call it a problem or just

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.180
a characteristic or whatever,

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.450
just a threat's not going to change that.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.450
Something--you're going to have to deal with that

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.220
in some way at some level.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.860
But what I do see is whether it's through ultimatum

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.100
or whatever, you have come to a point that

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.990
you have a willing partner here,

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.830
and I would really, really encourage both

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.500
of you to give this thing a shot where both

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.150
of you are on the same page at the same time,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.120
because I believe, particularly when

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.370
you have children involved,

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.120
if you're going to get out of a marriage,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.400
you have to earn your way out of that marriage,

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.380
and that means you have to turn over every stone,

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.640
investigate every avenue of possible rehabilitation.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.610
Go to counselors.  Go to your pastor.  Read books.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.380
Come here.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.970
Do whatever you can do to try to put it on,

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.370
because I don't want you to be looking

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.870
at your daughter 10 years from now and her say

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.210
`How come I had to grow up without my daddy?'

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.210
and you have to say,

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.410
`Well, I don't know.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.540
We just couldn't get it together at the same time,

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.250
and I got tired of it.'

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.580
That's not much of an answer to a child that has

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.190
to deal with that.  I want you to be able--it--it

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:51.480
may wind up that way,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.390
but I want you to be able to look at her and say,

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.130
`You know what, we really had compatibility problems.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.230
Let me tell you everything we did to try

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.130
to preserve this and it just didn't get there.'

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:02.860
But until you can say that,

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.470
I don't think you're ready to pull the plug on this,

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.400
and you've got to figure out what's going

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.310
on with you, because it is not just fixed

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.570
because she threatened to leave.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.600
WINFREY:  Next, she keeps track of when they do it

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.770
and when they don't.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.240
According to her calculations, it's not enough.

WINFREY:  What to do when your sexual appetite

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.350
doesn't match your mate's. We heard from couples

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.720
of all ages who are struggling with this problem.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.360
Barbara says her sex drive is in full throttle.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.390
But when she's ready for sex,

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.140
her 44-year-old husband is ready for sleep.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.480
BARBARA:  I'm a 45-year-old honeymooner that

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.840
has sex only about once or twice a month

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.680
and I'm supposed to be at my sexual peak.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.410
DAVID:  I can appreciate the fact Barb's

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.120
at her sexual peak, but Barbara's also a housewife.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.320
I leave at 6:30 in the morning

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.750
and I come home at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00 at night.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.720
It's not that I don't want to make love to her.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.060
It's that I'm just tired.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.260
BARBARA:  I definitely think our sex drives

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.530
are incompatible.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.570
If he would give one-tenth of the energy

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:13.830
he puts into his job to our sex life,

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.340
everything would be great.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.070
DAVID:  If Barb and I have sex once a day,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.600
then she wants it twice a day.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.870
If we have sex twice in a day,

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.040
she wants it three times a day.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.650
She told me we were doing good.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:27.610
BARBARA:  He'll say to me,

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.880
`Barb, it hasn't been that long.'

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.780
And I'll say, `Oh, yes, it has been that long,'

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.450
because I mark it on the calendar.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.020
And I do mark it on the calendar with a little heart.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.750
And that's my little symbol,

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.120
so that I know that that's the night we did it.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.960
DAVID:  When I come home, I--I'm afraid to touch

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.410
Barb or to be affectionate to Barb because if I do,

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:53.230
I know that she's going to automatically assume

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.070
and want to make love to me.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.450
I may just be wanting her have her close to me

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.180
or to touch her or to feel her

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.340
or to kiss her just to let her know I love her.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.380
BARBARA:  I told my husband if he doesn't use it,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.720
he's going to lose it.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.780
DAVID:  I think that she's taken it to a level that's

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.180
not necessarily good for our relationship.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.020
BARBARA:  Sometimes I really do cry about it.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.650
It makes me feel that maybe I'm not pretty enough.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:17.250
I always like to wear makeup

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:18.820
and stuff so I look pretty for him.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.210
But when he rejects me, it hurts my feelings.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.740
He does tell me how pretty I look and everything.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.670
But by the time I look over to him again, he's snoring.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.340
DAVID:  Barb is a good girl.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.500
I love her to death.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.580
I want her to be happy.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.410
There must be some sort of a compromise here

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.810
a--and we just need to try and find that compromise.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.810
BARBARA:  I don't want to end up having sex with

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.450
him once a month.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.930
I'm absolutely madly in love with this man.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.650
I'm just too young to be old.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:48.020
I want Dr. Phil to try to help me understand his needs

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.690
and where he's coming from and make him understand

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.260
my needs and where I'm coming from.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.460
WINFREY:  There you go.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.840
Dr. McGRAW:  So how often are you having sex these days?

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.380
DAVID:  We have two different versions of that.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.000
BARBARA:  Well, this month was a good month, OK?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.940
And thanks to you, Oprah, this morning.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.370
WINFREY: Really.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.570
BARBARA:  It was a big one.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:17.520
This is four--four times this month.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.590
But usually, last month, in December, one time.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.800
November, twice.  That's just not enough.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.090
Dr. McGRAW:  OK, and it...

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.060
DAVID:  And obviously I think it's more often than that.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.370
DAVID:  But I don't--I don't count the times.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.690
Dr. McGRAW:  How can you not agree on--I mean,

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.970
isn't this a fairly...

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.830
BARBARA:  I have proof.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.430
WINFREY:  She has proof.  She has a calendar.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.700
BARBARA:  I have proof.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.370
Dr. McGRAW:  She's got documents here, so...

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.330
BARBARA:  I do.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.040
Dr. McGRAW:  I mean, but how do--how do--how do--really,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.570
how do you all disagree about how many times?

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.140
I mean, because it would seem like that's

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.580
an either all or none sort of deal.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.290
BARBARA:  No, this is how we disagree.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.620
I will say to him,

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.710
`Honey, don't you think it's time we fool around?'

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.650
And he'll say, `Barb, we just did it.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:56.700
And I'll say, `Oh, no, we didn't, we did it two weeks ago.'

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.040
And I--I think that's too long.  I'm in my 40s.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.760
I think I'm speaking for a lot of American women here.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.260
This is the prime of my life.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.110
I want to enjoy my sexual life.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.980
He's just tired all the time, Dr. Phil,

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.580
and I'm so tired of him being tired.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.320
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  Now say what you mean. Don't...

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.560
BARBARA:  All right.  I will.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.080
I feel real strongly about this.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.080
But now seriously, though, there's something

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.990
that--that I picked up out of this tape, David,

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:28.600
that I want to ask you about.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:34.530
You have said that you think that she is, like,

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.070
addicted to this and over--overfocused on it

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.540
and that it--her energy for it is not healthy,

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.380
is that correct?

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.150
DAVID:  If we make love three times a week,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.980
she wants it five times a week.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:53.520
If we want--if--if we make love five times a month,

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.420
she wants it more. It's never enough,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.820
and she--and in her--and in her defense,

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.330
I mean, she always says how good it is

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.630
and she's always very positive about it.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.660
But one of the problems that I perceive that

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.200
we have is that it--it has come to a point

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.970
that I'm actually--I don't want to kiss her

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.140
or touch her or do the things that we used to

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.740
like to do and that I used to like to do

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.410
because of what some other people have said.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:22.340
I know it's going right into the bedroom.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.860
Dr. McGRAW:  OK.  But--well, there's two things

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.290
that--that may be problematic here that you need to consider.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.520
One is, you just may be, like, way good at it...

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.790
BARBARA:  He really is.  He is.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.460
Dr. McGRAW:  ...and so she's, like, really highly motivated.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.370
So I mean, you've got to own that part of it.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.360
And second, you say if you do it once,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.030
she wants it twice, she wants it three times.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.030
You know, maybe after she kind of got caught up,

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:47.600
that maybe that would relax a little bit,

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.970
and you would have--you would have more of a natural flow.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.940
Seriously.  I mean, is that a possibility?

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.250
BARBARA:  Absolutely.  He needs to catch up.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.910
That's absolutely true.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:58.810
Dr. McGRAW: So...

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.140
BARBARA:  I don't see--to me, Dr. Phil,

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.280
I don't think he has that big of a problem, you know.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.950
I mean, I could, like, not clean the house or,

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.130
like, not cook.  But to want to have sex,

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.190
I think that's a pretty good problem to have.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.620
Dr. McGRAW:  That has its benefits.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.860
WINFREY:  We'll finish up with Barbara

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.700

Dr. McGRAW:  What I'm concerned about is if

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.060
you've labeled her in your mind,

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.580
if you've put a label on her in your mind

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.350
as being wrong in what she wants,

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:43.250
then basically you dismiss this as her problem

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:47.390
instead of something that the two of you negotiate

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.060
a plan that you can both be excited about.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.510
And so if you--if you put a label on it,

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.970
`You're wrong, you're overmotivated,

you're in some way inappropriate there,'

DAVID:  No, I have not labeled it her problem.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.230
I have a desire to make love to her.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.060
I just--I work a lot.  I come home.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:44.350
`I work long hours.  I come home.'

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.720
And there comes a point in time where,

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:49.560
as we were saying, you have to make some choices,

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.500
where you say if I'm leaving it all at the office,

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.310
then I have nothing to invest at home,

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.860
and so you can be successful here and--and failing here

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.470
as opposed to not leaving it all at the office

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.560
and bringing some of it home energywise

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.040
and--and also you have something to give.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.000
If you come in and you're just totally zonked,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.190
what kind of companion do you think you are,

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.840
whether it's sexually or otherwise,

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.290
if all of your energy is left at the office?

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.400
DAVID:  Good point.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.000
Dr. McGRAW:  If you come in mentally, emotionally,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.600
behaviorally, sexually bankrupt,

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.400
you're not much of a companion for your partner.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.380
WINFREY:  Isn't that why you always play tennis

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.580
before you go home?

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.770
Dr. McGRAW:  I--I play ten--before I come home because it,

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.280
like, charges my batteries up,

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.410
because I have cabin fever terrible

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:39.480
if I go home without that. But instead if I play

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.350
and get my blood flowing again and stuff,

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.220
I come in having played.  I--you know,

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.050
I butt family time up against play instead of work

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.550
and I'm revitalized and I'm recharged.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.130
And I'm just wondering if--if, really,

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.490
it seems like you guys are obviously--I think

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:55.890
you're a really cute couple.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:57.800
You seem to have a lot of energy for each other,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.030
and you both got a sense of humor about it--which I think,

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.510
David, you need to really hold on to.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:10.710
And--and so--and so I--and so I--I really would

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.610
just really encourage you to say,

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.550
`I don't want to leave it all at the office

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.280
and let me see if we can come up with a plan

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.290
that both of us can be excited about where we

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.950
get'--because--and I wasn't just kidding.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.820
You do play catch-up.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.590
And--and once you kind of feel like you're not being

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.920
deprived and--and you have access,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.430
you'll calm down and things will be something

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:32.660
you can both live with.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.800
WINFREY:  Maybe they need a weekend away somewhere.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.130
BARBARA:  Oh, that would be wonderful.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.890

Dr. McGRAW:  You know, I--I--I really believe

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.320
that relationships are negotiated.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.120
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.960
Dr. McGRAW:  And the negotiation never stops,

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.910
and--and it's not an adversarial thing.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.660
It's not like you want to win or lose.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.060
My idea of negotiation is a win-win.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.630
Find out how to get both partners

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.970
as much of what they want as you possibly can.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.700
WINFREY:  And you have to be willing to ask for what you want.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.940
Dr. McGRAW:  And be specific.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.410
I mean, because I've said men don't get it,

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:15.540
but we are trainable.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.080
WINFREY:  Yeah.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.510
Dr. McGRAW:  We just need--you just put the dots

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.750
close together and connect them with a bright line

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.150
and--and we can figure these things out.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.750
But it's negotiation.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.220
And in the s--when it comes to sex,

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.750
you're not going to all be at the same place at the same time.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:30.530
WINFREY:  All the time.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.020
Dr. McGRAW:  You're not going to both want it

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.330
at the same level all the time.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:34.860
That would--that--I mean, that's not right.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.130
So what you've got to do is negotiate a way

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.600
that you--you know, one can come up,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.530
one can--can compromise some, and--and you

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.810
figure out how to get the most of what each of you want.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.400
And it doesn't have to be an argument.  It's not a fight.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.140
It's not a competition.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.480
It's a cooperation in which you negotiate

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.810
to find something that works for both of you.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:41:04.785
