00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.540
MICHAEL KIRK - Let’s start with the man
in Dresden.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.440
The Wall has come down.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.680
He’s far away from Russia, not exactly getting
to perform his dream job.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.810
He's not James Bond; he’s not a spy.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.990
He’s something else.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.540
Who is that Vladimir Putin in Dresden?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.790
PETER BAKER - Vladimir Putin in Dresden is
actually a midlevel bureaucrat as much as

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.790
anything else.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.020
I think we like to romanticize the idea of
him as this swashbuckling spy, and he probably

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.919
likes to romanticize that, too.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.820
But, in fact, he was in a second-tier post
and a second-tier job at a middling career

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.110
rank.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.100
[He's] out of the country when all these big
changes are happening back home.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.610
He’s left feeling adrift.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.260
He’s not part of the movement that Gorbachev
has put in place back in the Soviet Union.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.420
He's not witnessing some of the changes up
close.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.790
Instead, he’s seeing the unraveling of the
empire at its furthest frontier, and it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.710
very disconcerting to him.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.840
MICHAEL KIRK - We've all heard the stories.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.510
I'm not sure whether he invented the stories
or whether they actually happened, him stoking

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.710
the furnace with documents and breaking it
from the heat or standing out and stopping

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.490
a mob from taking over KGB headquarters.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.220
How much of that is real, and how much of
it is myth?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.650
PETER BAKER - It's a great question.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.510
I think in some ways, it doesn’t even matter
how real it is, because the myth itself informs

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.730
our understanding of his view.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.900
It informs how he sees the world, and whether
it happened precisely the way he described

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.659
it or not, whether as part of his narrative
that he created for the purposes of coming

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.310
to power or to justify the things he would
later do, it doesn’t really matter.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.970
It matters that he has presented this version
of reality to the world because it tells you

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.580
something about his psychology; it tells you
something about his history; it tells you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.890
something about the way he sees the events
that we saw in the West in very different

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
terms.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.330
MICHAEL KIRK - Tell us what he wants us to
know.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.789
PETER BAKER - I think what he wants us to
know is—I come back to the quote that he

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.859
said once that was really so revealing, that
the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.129
geopolitical catastrophe of the century.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.370
That's how he saw it.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.450
We didn't see it that way.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.260
In the United States, in the West, in Eastern
Europe, certainly, the collapse of the Soviet

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.090
Empire was a cause for joy.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.480
It was the end of the Cold War.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.849
It meant hundreds of millions of people had
been liberated either because their countries

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.379
were now independent, really, of the Soviet
orbit or because people in Russia and the

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.620
republics themselves now suddenly had a new
chance at freedom.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.059
That's not the way he saw it.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.680
He saw it as a collapse of empire; he saw
it as a failure of will.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:03:03.559
He saw it as a plot by the West to undermine
and defeat the Russian Empire, in effect.

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:09.450
It was a loss of greatness that seared him,
this derjobnost, this notion that Russia is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:18.559
this powerful historically important player
in the world suddenly cut down at its knees

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:23.860
by a perfidious West that was taking advantage
of its moment of weakness.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.969
They did not see this as a moment of triumph.

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.400
MICHAEL KIRK - Who was the little boy Vladimir
Putin?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.949
What is the early formation?

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.159
Is there a moment or two that you’ve discovered
that is revealing about him?

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
PETER BAKER - Well, what's interesting is
when he comes to power, he gives this series

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.159
of interviews.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.659
I'm sure you've read them.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.639
They’ve become collected in the [book] First
Person, and he tells stories about his own

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:51.769
upbringing that no American politician would
tell, right, because they are sort of raw,

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:00.069
and they are at moments very human—again,
if you credit them for being real.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:08.169
But this notion of a young Vladimir Putin,
small, slight, not very strong, living in

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:16.470
a pretty dingy part of St. Petersburg where
rats were in the hallways and bullies were

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.440
in the streets, it’s a very memorable idea
of his origin.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.810
Again, myth and reality tend to merge, but
it does tell you something about this powerful

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.150
need on his part to prove himself.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.780
He’s not a big guy, but he wants to be seen
as a big guy, and that was true as a small

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.040
child in the streets, where he would take
on the biggest kid he could find and hit him

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.470
in order to try to demonstrate his manhood,
if you will.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.720
It’s true today on the geopolitical stage.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.570
He takes on the biggest kid on the block,
and he punches him in the nose and sees if

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.570
he can get away with it.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.570
That's the United States.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.460
MICHAEL KIRK - Again, the myth is he tries
to sign up for the KGB when he’s 16.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.820
In fact, he signs up when he's 23.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.700
What does the KGB give young Vladimir Putin?

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.970
What does it deliver for him in that society
at that time?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.970
PETER BAKER - Well, we see in the West the
KGB as an ominous, dark force.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.450
We see it as the evil character in every Hollywood
movie.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.520
In Russia, at that time, many if not most
Russians saw the KGB as an institution of

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.240
excellence, actually.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.670
It was seen as, in a way, as the Harvard of
the Soviet Union.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.590
You got into the KGB because you were the
best.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.070
They romanticized it.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.210
It was a false image, of course, but one that
was propagated by Soviet propaganda, one of

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.640
which was this serial The Sword and the Shield,
which Putin as a young man recalled watching,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.320
which tells the story of this Russian agent
in Germany during World War II.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.470
It romanticizes the idea of the KGB as the
defender of Russian national identity, and

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:18.200
he buys into it, and that's what he wants
to do at some point in his life.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.080
It is important to understand his identity
that way.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.520
What exactly he did in the KGB is still a
matter of some debate, and we've never had

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.250
a good, full forensic analysis of everything
he did.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.580
But just the idea of it is so important to
understand his thinking.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.190
MICHAEL KIRK - We talked to somebody who said
his dad was in the KGB and nobody ever really

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.670
talked about it, but they did have a telephone
forever in their apartment.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.830
Did you ever hear this?

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.000
PETER BAKER - You know, there's always been—again,
I've never spent a lot of time excavating

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.480
But you have to understand his grandfather
was a cook for Lenin, Stalin.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.010
I mean, it's not like they didn't have connections
growing up.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.650
So part of the narrative of the young boy
in the streets belies the connections that

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.220
his family did have at some point.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.639
But I don't know a lot of the history.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:22.990
We know his father was a stern, harsh figure,
and he was often seen as an important influence

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:33.250
in young Putin's life—unforgiving, unloving,
not particularly encouraging, and obviously

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.720
some of that plays into who Vladimir Putin
grows up to become.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.720
…

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.560
MICHAEL KIRK - OK, so our man returns to a
very different Russia than he left.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.560
He’s in Leningrad or St. Petersburg.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.940
How much matters about what he does working
for [Mayor Anatoly] Sobchak?

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.570
Why is it in any way interesting or important,
if at all?

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.230
PETER BAKER - Anatoly Sobchak, of course,
was the promise for the future.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:11.169
He was the new Russia, we hoped, we thought;
a reformist, a believer in new system, the

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:18.040
mayor of St. Petersburg who was going to help
bring Russia into a new era.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:25.550
The idea that he would have as a deputy mayor,
his number two guy, this man Vladimir Putin,

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.639
I think a lot of people assume that he must
share some of those convictions.

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.380
I think that was clearly a misunderstanding.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.169
Putin was definitely in Sobchak’s inner
circle, but he did not see the world in the

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.169
same way.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:45.230
I think we might also be misjudging Sobchak
and how much of a Westernizer and reformer

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.699
he really was.

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:54.009
But out of that comes this notion of Putin
as a loyalist, which figures later into his

00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:55.589
ascension into power.

00:08:55.589 --> 00:09:01.350
Sobchak comes under fire; he’s facing investigations,
and it’s Putin who gets him out of the country.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.800
It’s Putin who spirits him to, I think it's
France.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.949
It’s that loyalty that later impresses Boris
Yeltsin and, importantly, people around Boris

00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:14.640
Yeltsin who worry about what comes next.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.769
When Yeltsin steps down, will the person who
succeeds him stay loyal to him, or will he

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:27.269
face some sort of retaliatory investigation
or prosecution or what have you?

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:33.259
So it’s that fierce devotion to Sobchak
even if their own philosophical identities

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:36.850
might be different that becomes critical to
Putin's rise.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.850
…

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:43.949
MICHAEL KIRK - The [Bill] Clinton-[Boris]
Yeltsin relationship and the power of what

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:50.300
Clinton and America wanted and what we were
doing to Russia in the ’90s, that would

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:56.529
eventually set the stage for many things Vladimir
Putin as president doesn't like.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:57.529
Set me up for that.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:01.439
PETER BAKER - Well, This is so critical to
understand Putin today—to understand the

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:05.389
’90s, understand what happened after the
end of the Soviet Union.

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:11.399
There was this moment of obviously great optimism
in Washington on the idea that we were now

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.339
going to be friends with Russia; we were going
to be partners.

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:18.779
They were going to be part of our team, in
effect, and no one encapsulated that better

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:24.249
than Bill Clinton, who thought he could forge
a personal relationship with Boris Yeltsin

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:27.199
that would extend to their national interests
as well.

00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:31.670
There's no question they had a pretty close
personal tie.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:37.670
If you talk to Bill Clinton even today, he
speaks about Yeltsin with great fondness and

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.430
nostalgia.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:50.420
They were both sort of pudgy kids who were
larger than life, and they had a sort of real

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.809
gregarious kind of political persona, and
they bonded in a very real way.

00:10:55.809 --> 00:11:00.839
But that only disguised the real issues that
were going on, which was that the United States

00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:05.319
and Russia still had very different national
interests in the world, and that manifested

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:11.350
itself through things like NATO expansion,
through the war in Yugoslavia and so on.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:21.309
And it masked the fact that Yeltsin at home
was not the Lincoln of his country as Clinton

00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:22.529
wanted to see him.

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:25.180
He was a much more complicated figure.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:31.930
He basically almost singlehandedly broke up
the Soviet Union, arguably, and he did in

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.939
fact, therefore, bring a new openness and
freedom to Russia that it had never really

00:11:35.939 --> 00:11:36.939
experienced.

00:11:36.939 --> 00:11:38.980
But it was a very flawed democracy.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:49.029
It was a democracy that was seen by Russians
as chaotic, as corrupt, as very deeply flawed,

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:55.029
one where friends of the president or connected
oligarchs were able to fleece the state of

00:11:55.029 --> 00:12:01.300
these massive, lucrative assets while everyday
Russians suddenly lost the social safety net

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.480
that they had been used to; in some cases
lost their life savings through the economic

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.059
changes that were happening around them.

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:15.079
Politics were played out literally at gunpoint
when tanks were fired at the [Russian] White

00:12:15.079 --> 00:12:21.329
House during a fight between Yeltsin and the
parliament, and there was mafia-style hits

00:12:21.329 --> 00:12:24.529
in the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:28.089
So this was democracy as Russians experienced
it.

00:12:28.089 --> 00:12:33.410
And, of course, they would look at that with
a great deal of jaundice.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:42.259
What happens under Yeltsin is that the promise
of 1991 becomes the reality of 1999, and it’s

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:49.820
messy; it's ugly; it’s a turnoff to many
Russians.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:55.779
So when we arrive there at the end of 2000,
and you ask Russians, “Well, what does democracy

00:12:55.779 --> 00:13:00.670
mean to you?,” it means dislocation; it
means chaos; it means corruption.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.389
It did not mean a shining city on the hill.

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:12.910
So this period of Yeltsin and Clinton, as
we look back on it today as kind of a moment

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.890
of great harmony between our countries, really
sets the stage for somebody like Vladimir

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.890
Putin.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.890
…

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.890
MICHAEL KIRK - Yeltsin had just had it.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.970
He’d lost the people; he felt he’d failed.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.060
And on that New Year’s Eve, what did he
say when he went on television?

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.410
PETER BAKER - Well, Yeltsin by that point
was a broken figure.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.300
The country was not in great shape.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.899
More importantly, his image with the country
was not in great shape.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:42.600
He was drinking too much; he was physically
weak.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.069
And he recognized that his time had run out.

00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:52.870
To his credit, he has arguably done something
that almost no other Russian leader had done

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.259
in history, which is to voluntarily give up
power.

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:57.620
That's an extraordinary thing.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.860
Gorbachev did, but really had no choice by
the time he surrenders at the end of 1991.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:09.649
Yeltsin for the first time gives up power
and sets up at least a semi-democratic process

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:13.709
to replace him.

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:17.110
In that process, though, he needs to protect
himself.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:23.939
There's not a lot of history of former Russian
leaders living nice lives, and, given the

00:14:23.939 --> 00:14:30.850
sort of "anything goes" kind of nature of
Russian society at that time, he wanted guarantees

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.740
that he—especially his family—would be
protected.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.369
That's where Putin comes in.

00:14:35.369 --> 00:14:36.509
Putin is this functionary.

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:39.420
He’s a nobody; he’s a bland figure.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:46.459
Nobody would say that he had any kind of political
constituency outside of a very small orbit.

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:51.730
But the Yeltsin clan, his daughter and the
people around him, decide that this is someone

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.699
who can be trusted to take power.

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:58.239
They're not looking for a democrat; they're
not looking for somebody to really consolidate

00:14:58.239 --> 00:15:01.779
the advances that Yeltsin really had been
responsible for.

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:05.329
They're looking for somebody who would protect
him and them.

00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:11.309
So you have this situation where Yeltsin,
the first real democrat, small “d,” of

00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:16.850
Russia, turns over power to somebody who is
diametrically opposite him in almost every

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.850
way.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.639
MICHAEL KIRK - Does he know that, or is his
hope a strategy at this moment?

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:24.529
PETER BAKER - He clearly doesn't fully grasp
that, because otherwise he would understand

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:29.550
that his own legacy is in jeopardy by this
decision he’s making.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:35.230
I think he saw Putin as a pragmatic figure
who would probably make some compromises that

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:41.139
Yeltsin wouldn’t make but would not radically
change the course that he had set the country

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:42.779
on.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:45.449
It was a fundamental misjudgment, obviously.

00:15:45.449 --> 00:15:52.459
You could argue, basically—some people would
argue that Putin's first months and maybe

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:55.689
even years in office showed some promise of
that.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:59.060
I think that was a misjudgment even then.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.790
I'm not one of those people who believes that
Putin suddenly changed; he was this and then

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:04.790
became that.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.939
I think he was who he is today from the beginning.

00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:13.399
There are stages where he becomes more so
or less so, and he tacks this way or that

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.399
way.

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:20.009
But who he is today was fundamentally clear
even at the time, if you chose to go and look

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:21.009
at what he was doing and saying.

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:25.709
MICHAEL KIRK - But he is a little bit of a
wolf in sheep’s clothing at that exact moment

00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:27.160
anyway.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.970
Even Clinton—Strobe [Talbott] told us the
story yesterday of Clinton.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:36.889
They visited Yeltsin a little while later,
and Clinton says to him: “You keep an eye

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:38.240
on this guy.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.139
He’s not what he seems to be.”

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:41.439
PETER BAKER - Exactly.

00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:46.920
Clinton is put off by Putin partly because
Putin figures Clinton's on the way out.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.009
Remember, he takes power at the end of 1999,
beginning of 2000.

00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:53.420
Clinton's only got a year left in power.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.660
Putin doesn’t have much time for him.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.730
This is not what Clinton was used to when
it came to Russia.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.760
He was used to having his way; he was used
to having somebody he could relate to.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.760
Putin was a cold fish, and Clinton didn't
respond well to him.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:18.550
He did, in his own memoir, express optimism
that Putin would be a solid leader, a tough

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:25.800
leader but somebody who would mostly do the
right thing, and that was a misjudgment.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:32.400
But I think he saw some of what was to come
and recognized that Putin was not another

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400
Boris Yeltsin.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:40.800
MICHAEL KIRK - For those Kremlin watchers
like yourself and others, when did it start,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.280
or what were the first signs that Vladimir
Putin was not Boris Yeltsin?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.630
PETER BAKER - I think it actually came before
he became president, even.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.130
If you look back even in the very short time
he’s prime minister under Yeltsin, he launches

00:17:54.130 --> 00:18:08.710
the Second Chechen War on pretty sketchy justification
and uses this very bloody, very harsh military

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.260
operation to vault himself to power.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.070
So you could argue even before he becomes
president, basically he’s begun to show

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.800
his stripes.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.580
Very soon afterward, though, from the very
beginning, he heads down this road of consolidation

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.910
of power.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:32.001
He goes after two oligarchs that he perceived
to be threats to him, Boris Berezovsky and

00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:33.840
Vladimir Gusinsky.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.750
When we arrive in early 2000, end of 2000,
early 2001, he’s in the midst of this broad

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:48.410
campaign against Gusinsky’s media outfit,
NTV, and the associated organizations with

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.510
it because he needs to control power.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:55.540
He comes to power on the strength of controlled
television, and he understands, therefore,

00:18:55.540 --> 00:19:00.750
it's going to be a threat to him to have television
in anybody else’s hands while he’s in

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.750
power.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:07.760
The first thing he does is he goes after the
independent, or at least independent-minded,

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.550
media organizations in Russia.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.100
I think even from the beginning, you could
see the way he really saw the world and the

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.910
way he was going to proceed.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:24.000
MICHAEL KIRK - When he takes down the television
and replaces it, there are some shows, I gather,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.630
that really get under his skin, [like] Kukly
(Dolls).

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.160
PETER BAKER - Kukly was his bête noire.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160
He hated Kukly.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.760
Kukly was this very funny satirical show on
NTV that used puppets to represent public

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.420
figures in Russia.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:43.150
It really isn't any different than what most
Americans would recognize in our own late-night

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.750
comedy.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:51.980
It satirized and ridiculed people in power,
and it satirized and ridiculed Vladimir Putin.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.250
He didn't like that.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.430
He didn't believe in that kind of thing, and
it really got under his skin, and I think

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.659
that is one of the motivators for him for
going after NTV.

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:01.659
…

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:06.370
MICHAEL KIRK - … Take me to what you can
understand or what you perceive as [George

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:12.930
W.] Bush and his White House’s perspective
on what they needed from Putin, who Putin

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:18.880
was, and where they thought they could go
with Russia, if they cared about Russia very

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.270
much at all at that time.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:26.190
PETER BAKER - Bush saw the big geopolitical
threat of his administration being China,

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.990
so to him, Russia was important in a sense
that we needed to be friends with them.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.350
If we were going to worry about China, we
needed to be friends with Russia.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.620
It's an old dynamic in American foreign policy.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:42.550
When he meets Putin for the first time in
June of 2001 in Slovenia, he’s very open

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.190
to the idea of a new friendship.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:50.900
This, of course, is where he makes his famous
comment about looking into Vladimir Putin's

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.900
soul.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.900
…

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.512
MICHAEL KIRK -As he [Putin] approaches the
United States and the new president of the

00:20:54.512 --> 00:20:59.780
United States [George W. Bush], what is he
hoping for, and what does he do to prepare

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.570
to interact with the president of the United
States?

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.930
PETER BAKER - Well, he’s playing a weak
hand at this point.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.170
Putin is playing a weak hand.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:14.060
The country is 10 years into its new experiment
and has an economy basically the size of Portugal

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.080
and no hope, it seems, to restore itself.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:24.810
It’s laden with international debt; it has
done nothing to diversify its economy.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:31.590
Oil prices have not begun to shoot up as they
would later and that's the fundamental basis

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.980
of their economic program.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:41.940
Little structural change has been made in
things like property rights and a judicial

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.860
code and the labor code.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.910
All these things are still under works.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:52.650
So he’s playing a weak hand, and he sees
the United States as the dominant player on

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.160
the international stage, and he doesn't like
it.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:00.610
He wants to be treated as an equal the way
the Soviet Union was during the Cold War.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:05.110
There's this resentment, there's this grievance
that's sort of eating away at him, and it's

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.990
fundamental to his tenure, this sense of grievance.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.850
So what does he do?

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.700
He studies George W. Bush.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.650
He spends time thinking about who this guy
is, what motivates him, what works him.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:27.380
This is the old KGB officer whose job it is
to basically turn people toward his interests,

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.140
and he plays it that way.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.960
So when they sit down in Slovenia, he’s
well-briefed.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.730
In fact, he makes some comment about Bush
playing rugby or something like that in the

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.120
old days, and Bush says, “You're very well-briefed.”

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:47.620
I mean, Bush recognized it as a fellow politician
when somebody’s been prepared for a meeting.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:54.210
But Bush then says something to Putin about
the story he had read or been told by his

00:22:54.210 --> 00:23:01.390
advisers about Putin's cross, the cross his
mother had given him and how one time the

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:06.160
dacha burned down, and the one thing that
was saved from the burning building was this

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.290
cross that Putin's mother had given him.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:16.240
Putin instantly recognizes this as his lever
in, and he tells the story with some relish

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.200
and connects with Bush, who’s a very religious
Christian on this level.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.420
Now, whether Putin himself is Christian or
religious is, I think, up to debate, but he

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:30.960
recognized as a political actor that it was
a way to make a connection to a guy for whom

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.960
this would be very important.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.220
Mind you, he wasn't wearing the cross that
he was talking about with him at that time;

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.730
he didn't have it with him.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:42.420
He later brings it to a different summit later
on in Genoa later in the year to show Bush.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.420
“Hey, remember that cross?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.420
Here it is.”

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.420
But he didn't have it with him at the time.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.290
It wasn't so important to him that he kept
it with him at that moment.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:54.430
But he recognized the opportunity to bond
with Bush on a level that would work.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:59.530
And that's when President Bush comes out afterward
and tells the press that he’s found somebody

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:05.630
he can do business with; he's looked into
his soul and vouches, in effect, for Putin

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.220
in a way that would later come back to haunt
him.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.220
…

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.700
MICHAEL KIRK - The way they tell the story,
9/11 happens, and he’s the first phone call—at

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:22.040
least he gets to Condi Rice in making an offer
that—he knows it’s Afghanistan.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:29.670
I guess he figures out that’s where we're
going to go and he makes an offer so that

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:30.670
what?

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.670
Why would he do that?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:36.730
PETER BAKER - Well, this is a period where
there's a genuine moment of Russian-American

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.770
rapprochement or closeness.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:43.260
There's a debate even today as to whether
or not it could have led to something more

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.740
had it been handled differently.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.450
Did we blow it?

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:55.160
But basically after 9/11, Vladimir Putin seizes
an opportunity to join up with the West in

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.290
what he sees as a great battle against Islamic
extremism around the world.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.080
He's connecting it to Chechnya.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.480
He is seeing 9/11 and the World Trade Center
and Al Qaeda in the lens of his war against

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.360
Chechen rebels in the southern part of Russia.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.190
Now, the difference, of course, is that the
Chechen war did not start as an Islamic jihad.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:20.580
It started off as a nationalist aspiration,
a territory that didn't want to be controlled

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.580
by Moscow.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:28.500
It only became infused by religious extremism
later when the Islamic radical world decided

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.880
to adopt it as a cause celebre.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.500
But Putin wanted to link these two things.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.930
Bush is wary about that.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:43.680
He basically saw that as a different kettle
of fish, that what Al Qaeda had done to the

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:50.150
United States and the threat that it posed
to Europe and its allies was different than

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:54.640
what was happening in Chechnya, and he was
wary of getting too deep with Putin into that

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640
rat hole.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.190
In fact, there was a proposal at the time
that the United States would actually help

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:03.030
Russia fight the war in Chechnya, and Bush
and a lot of people around him said that's

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.720
not going to happen; that's not what we're
going to do.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.920
But there is a moment where Putin is cooperative.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:15.010
He basically opens up Central Asia to American
troops to begin the war in Afghanistan.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.440
That's not a small thing.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.730
The idea that American troops could be located
not on Russian territory but on territory

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.430
that Russia considered to be part of its orbit,
the former Central Asian republics of the

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:31.210
Soviet Union is a big deal, and it's a deal
that Putin doesn't find unanimity within his

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.790
own circle about, either.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:38.740
His own security hawks were advising him against
this, and they were aghast that Putin would

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:44.520
agree to this American presence on their own
southern flank.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.760
It goes against everything they had believed
about their own security.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.560
But, you know, Russia had been in Afghanistan.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.750
Russia knew the threat that the Taliban faced,
and it had no interest in fighting the Taliban

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.410
itself, so if America wanted to go into Afghanistan
to fight the Taliban for it, that in Putin's

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.800
mind was in Russia's interests, too.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:13.970
So there was this moment where interests converged
a little bit, and it was a moment of interesting

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.970
promise.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:23.920
I was in Moscow on 9/11, and I'll never forget
how much the Russian people really reached

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.400
out to us as Americans in empathy and sympathy
and solidarity.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:35.870
Outside the American Embassy the next day
was this sea of flowers and crosses and icons

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:41.040
and candles, and there were signs, and they
said things that said, “We were together

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.010
at Elbe, and we’ll be together again.”

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.520
It was really a moment.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.270
I was stopped in the street by Russians who
didn't know me but obviously figured out I

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.480
was American, and they pulled out pictures
of the World Trade Center and said: “I visited

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480
there.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480
I was there.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.000
We are with you on this.”

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.990
It was mind-blowing.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:04.400
So there was a sense that maybe Russian-American
relations would be different after this.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:13.950
MICHAEL KIRK - And then we pull out of the
ABM [Anti-Ballistic Missile] Treaty; Iraq—one

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:21.720
thing after another in lots of ways.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.880
It results in what Steve Hadley, I think,
said, [that] we in Europe just threw Russia

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.690
into the toilet or something.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.070
PETER BAKER - Well, he says that later, though.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:36.140
He says that in 2008 after the Georgia war,
just to be fair.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:45.350
But what happens is there is this implicit
expectation by Putin of a trade-off.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.720
“I'm going to help you on your war on terror.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.700
I'm allowing you into Central Asia.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.490
I'm going to allow you to train troops in
Georgia, by the way.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.520
And in return, I expect something.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.720
I expect a better trade deal.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:05.680
I expect you to get rid of Jackson-Vanik,”
which is this old Cold War-era trade law that

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.860
just really vexed the Russians, even though
it didn't have much tangible effect.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:17.320
He expected to be consulted as a partner,
as a full partner, and he didn't get what

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.420
he thought he deserved in return for his cooperation
on the war on terror.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:28.060
He was very disappointed and very upset about
this.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.840
I don't think the ABM Treaty was the big thing,
but I do think the Iraq War at that point

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.660
begins to consolidate this idea that we're
on the opposite sides again.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:49.780
He saw the Iraq War as America's effort to
control the Middle East, to assert itself

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.030
and at Russia's expense.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:58.740
He works to undercut European support for
the Iraq War.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:07.660
He goes to Germany and Paris and talks with
[Chancellor Gerhard] Schröder and [President

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:14.290
Jacques] Chirac at this time and thinks he
can basically carve off America's traditional

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.480
allies using the Iraq War.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:24.230
That’s sort of the end of the period of
harmony and the beginning of a new period

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.230
of estrangement.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:29.570
MICHAEL KIRK - … Somewhere in there, in
the ‘04s and the ‘05s, he’s, I guess,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:36.680
that paranoia which will live and vibrantly
drive everything he does, is at least under

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680
way?

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.490
PETER BAKER - … Most Americans won't remember
it, but in the end of 2003, in the tiny former

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:48.710
Soviet republic of Georgia, there comes this
revolution against the entrenched leadership

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:56.630
led by a dynamic, young, new, pro-Western
30-something-year-old opposition leader named

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.480
Mikheil Saakashvili.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.530
This becomes known as the Rose Revolution
because he comes into parliament bearing a

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.060
rose.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:11.220
To Putin, this is the height of CIA plot.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.960
This is American instigation.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.450
And, you know, it’s not hard to see how
he comes to that conclusion.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:24.130
There are American NGOs there that are trying
to teach Georgians and other former Soviet

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:31.051
republics how to practice democracy and how
to exhibit opposition to a government if they

00:31:31.051 --> 00:31:32.051
feel that way.

00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:37.860
They didn't create the Rose Revolution, but
they certainly helped the opposition leaders

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.410
figure out how to conduct it, in effect.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.660
I was there.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:49.510
I remember that night in the streets, and
the Georgians were just parading down the

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.700
streets and honking their horns and flying
their flags, and they had succeeded in taking

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:58.460
over their country to restore it to a democracy
and to bring it into the West.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:05.330
It was exhilarating for them, and it was exhilarating,
by the way, for a lot of American policymakers

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.200
in George Bush’s administration.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.809
But it was a threat to Vladimir Putin, and
he saw that there on his southern flank as

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:14.590
an American effort to undercut him.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:19.810
And if it could happen there, it could happen
in Moscow.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.700
MICHAEL KIRK - Take me to the Munich speech.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:29.501
Seems like a really important declaration
of something, especially if you—well, take

00:32:29.501 --> 00:32:31.220
me there.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:35.360
PETER BAKER - Every year there's a security
conference in Munich.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:42.750
It's a gathering point for important defense
and intelligence and political figures from

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:48.680
around the world, and here shows up Vladimir
Putin to give a speech.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:55.450
In his speech, he compares the United States
to the Third Reich, and it’s a real lightning

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:57.450
blow to Washington.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:00.320
It’s Vladimir Putin's declaration of independence.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.650
“I am through with your monopolization of
the international stage.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:13.390
You can't just sit there and play God, telling
the rest of the world what to do in Iraq,

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:20.140
on these color revolutions,” on everything
as he saw it, in Washington's agenda.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:28.450
It comes against the backdrop of NATO expansion
further into the eastern parts of Europe.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:33.610
The idea that perhaps even Ukraine and Georgia
might be on a track to join, that's unthinkable

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:34.890
to Vladimir Putin.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:38.820
The Munich speech is really kind of a wakeup
call for the West.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:45.970
This guy is not one of us; he doesn't want
to be one of us, and there's a real break

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.120
here to contemplate.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.220
MICHAEL KIRK - It is followed two months later
by the attack on Estonia.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.059
PETER BAKER - Yeah, the cyberattack.

00:33:54.059 --> 00:34:02.190
MICHAEL KIRK - Yeah, maybe a first early kind
of—but fairly sophisticated attack on the

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:08.149
most cyber-connected country in that part
of the world.

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:10.250
What's he trying to do?

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:14.180
PETER BAKER - I think in hindsight, we probably
should look back on Estonia as a more critical

00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.909
moment than we might have seen it at the time,
because it was in fact a harbinger of what

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.060
was to come.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:26.230
You had a resurgent Russia that was determined
to assert itself on the international stage

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:31.830
and willing to use different means to do it,
not just simply military means, of which it

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:38.429
still had considerable resources, but was
not the giant it once was.

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.560
Instead it goes after Estonia in the modern
sense.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.990
It uses Estonia’s own strength, its own
wiredness against it.

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:56.010
It’s a way of, somewhat surreptitiously,
although everybody understood what was happening,

00:34:56.010 --> 00:35:02.651
making a point to the world: “We're still
here, and this is our part of the world, and

00:35:02.651 --> 00:35:06.050
you’d better show us the respect we deserve.”

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.050
…

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:15.580
MICHAEL KIRK - By the end of the Bush administration,
who is Putin, and what does the White House

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.890
think of him and how they’ve handled it?

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:22.420
PETER BAKER - Bush grows progressively disillusioned
with Putin over time.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.810
The early optimism fades by the end of the
first term.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.930
He watches as Putin is throwing Mikhail Khodorkovsky,
the oil baron, into prison.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:37.260
He watches as Putin is more aggressive in
the former Soviet space.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.500
And he talks about this privately with people
like Tony Blair and other foreign leaders.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.550
He says to them things like: “You know,
I think we've lost Putin.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.839
I think he’s no longer a democrat; he’s
a czar.”

00:35:50.839 --> 00:35:54.290
And he gets into these fights with Putin behind
the scenes in their various summit meetings

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:57.960
about the nature of democracy, and Putin is
having none of it.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.940
He doesn’t want to be lectured.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:07.020
He says things to Bush like, “How can you
lecture me about a free press when you fired

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.210
that reporter?”

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.220
And Bush is scratching his head, “Well,
what are you talking about?”

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.810
Finally he realizes that Putin is referring
to Dan Rather, who gets pushed out of CBS

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:22.070
after the fake report or the untrue report
about Bush's military records.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.580
Putin is convinced that Bush is the one that
fired him, because that's what would happen

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.330
in Russia, and Bush has to explain to him:
“You’d better not say that out in public

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.910
because people will laugh at you.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:32.119
I don’t fire reporters.

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:35.020
You know, I don’t like some of them, but
I don’t get to fire them.”

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.750
But Putin won't believe that.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.910
So Bush tells Blair, and he tells some of
these other leaders, he says, “It’s like

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:44.200
arguing with an eighth grader who doesn't
have the facts,” and he's frustrated with

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.100
Putin.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:52.790
And Putin—I'm sure somebody’s told you
this story, but this is one of my favorite

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.790
stories.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.890
Bush tells a story about the dog, right?

00:36:56.890 --> 00:37:02.140
Putin meets his dog, a little Scottish terrier,
Barney, and says to him, “What, that's a

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.140
dog?”

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.020
And then a year later when Bush goes to visit
Putin in Russia, he brings him out to the

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.960
dacha and says, “Would you like to meet
my dog?,” and Bush says, “Sure.”

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:17.150
Then comes barreling out this sort of [dog]
Bush describes as this big, massive hellhound.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.300
Thump, thump, thump.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:27.930
You have this image, from Bush's telling anyway,
of Cerberus, dripping from the fangs or whatever.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:33.870
And Putin says to him, “This is my dog,
bigger, stronger, faster than Barney.”

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:41.340
It’s his moment of macho “My dog’s tougher
than your dog” one-upmanship.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340
Bush gets that, you know.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.660
I mean, Bush is a competitive guy.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:54.030
He understands what Putin is about is, “I'm
a big dude, and you’d better respect me.”

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.600
By the end, he hasn’t given up on Putin.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.060
He never fully gives up on him, but he’s
very disenchanted.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.500
He's very upset about it.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:11.860
They have this clash in Beijing after the
Georgia war begins.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.720
He goes to him and says, “What are you doing?

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.720
Why are you—”

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.369
They're both there in Beijing for the Olympics,
and Bush gets word that Russian troops are

00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:19.680
now entering Georgia.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:25.920
He’s sitting just a few [meters] away from
Putin, and he goes up to Putin, and he basically

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.330
says, “What's going on here?”

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.370
And he says: “Well, it’s all Saakashvili.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.540
I warned you about Saakashvili.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.060
He’s a bad guy.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.369
I warned you he was hot-blooded.”

00:38:34.369 --> 00:38:37.950
So he’s blaming Georgia’s leader.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.830
And Putin says, “Well, I'm hot-blooded,
too.”

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.630
And Bush says, “No, Vladimir, you're cold-blooded.”

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.270
It's this sort of like this break.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.090
There's nothing left to be said at this point.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.090
…

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.770
Q: OK, Bush rides off into the sunset, and
the change candidate comes in as president

00:38:53.770 --> 00:39:02.230
of the United States with a Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton, and it’s right at the right

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.880
time for a change in the Russian government.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:13.090
And they decide to call—somehow, somebody,
starts to call it the “reset.”

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:19.090
Tell me the story of why the reset and the
reset button and the change and the new view

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.480
that Obama and Clinton bring to it.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.750
PETER BAKER - You should make sure to ask
[Michael] McFaul about the origin of the reset,

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:26.590
and particularly the button.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:32.890
But Barack Obama comes to power at this moment
of great tension between the United States

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.970
and Russia.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:38.690
The Georgia war happened during the campaign.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:42.100
The two sides are basically not speaking at
this point.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.780
They’ve torn up a civilian nuclear cooperation
agreement.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.500
There's this very bad blood.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.250
And as a new president coming to power, Obama
makes a decision that it’s worth it to try

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.950
to start again; let's put all this behind
us and reset the relationship.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:05.510
The term that he uses on television, that
Biden uses in a speech in Europe, and it becomes

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:09.480
the term that basically defines a policy,
a “reset,” a reboot, in effect.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.290
Let's turn the computer off and start it again
and see if we can't get this better.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:18.470
He has a thought that he’ll be able to work
with Putin's designated successor.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:23.870
Dmitry Medvedev, a longtime lieutenant to
Putin, had come to the presidency while Putin

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.460
became prime minister.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.300
Everybody understood that Putin was still
really running things, that he was still the

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.300
real puppet master.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:37.120
But there was a thought in the White House
that perhaps Obama can bond with Medvedev

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:43.290
and work with him to build him up as a prominent
world leader and that that would, in fact,

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:49.900
elevate a younger, more progressively minded
figure on the Russian stage, and it wouldn’t

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.190
all be Putin.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.870
Medvedev was closer to Obama's age.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.010
Like Obama, he was a lawyer.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:03.359
He was seemingly less entrenched in the old
ways than Putin.

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:04.370
It was a gamble.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:09.109
It was a gamble that they could make it work,
and it was a gamble that underestimated how

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:11.410
important Putin really was still to the system.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:16.530
And it overestimated their ability to influence
Russia's internal dynamics.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:25.950
MICHAEL KIRK - And Putin sitting there as
prime minister really creating a fiction here,

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.690
really still running it?

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.460
Any back-and-forth politics between he and
Medvedev?

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.510
PETER BAKER - Putin as prime minister is,
in theory, in charge of the economy, in charge

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:40.660
of domestic affairs, while Medvedev as president
is more the international figure.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.360
To some extent, Putin gives Medvedev some
rope.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:49.760
He allows Medvedev to mainly handle some of
these global issues and these relationships

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:55.460
with other countries while Putin sits back
in the prime minister’s office working on

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.460
the country.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.859
But it is a short rope.

00:41:58.859 --> 00:42:05.730
I mean, Medvedev is not free to do everything
he wants, and Medvedev makes mistakes from

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:06.730
Putin's point of view.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:07.730
…

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.210
MICHAEL KIRK - Let's just back up for a minute
and start [with] Arab Spring, OK?

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.390
Arab Spring comes on, the democracy movements.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:18.390
The very thing that we've already said to
each other Putin fears more than anything

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:24.620
is the “spontaneous ejection of a despot.”

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.500
[It’s] all starting to feel a little personal
to him as it gets closer and closer to move

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.140
across the region, and the Obama White House,
at least in the beginning, seems to encourage

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.210
and embrace the idea of these very things.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:42.609
And I'm sure Putin's sitting there says, “I
wonder what role the United States is playing

00:42:42.609 --> 00:42:44.100
in all of this.”

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.980
PETER BAKER - Well, that's exactly right.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:50.930
Basically Obama sees the Arab Spring, the
sort of rolling revolutions, as a repeat of

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:57.490
1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and
he wants to be on the right side of history.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:02.920
Vladimir Putin looks at what's happening in
the Arab world, and he sees it as Dresden

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.030
all over again.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:12.840
He sees it as the American meddling in other
countries’ affairs to the detriment of Mother

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.060
Russia.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:22.030
In his mind, the Arab Spring is a symbol of
what could happen in Russia if he allows it

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:23.030
to.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:31.820
So when Medvedev basically goes along with
Obama on Libya, that’s where Putin comes

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.619
to the end of the line.

00:43:34.619 --> 00:43:39.760
Obama reluctantly agrees to a military campaign
in Libya to protect civilians against Muammar

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.480
el-Qaddafi, who threatens to wipe them out
like cockroaches.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.830
Obama's not that interested, frankly, in getting
involved militarily in Libya, but he’s persuaded

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:51.850
to by Hillary Clinton and some other advisers
who say: “Look, this is important.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.580
We can't stand by while some great slaughter
happens.”

00:43:54.580 --> 00:44:00.730
Medvedev is persuaded to abstain at the United
Nations Security Council and therefore to

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:02.240
allow this to happen.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:09.300
It's under the justification of protecting
civilians, but later on it ends up becoming,

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.369
to Putin anyway, regime change, because the
same rebels who are protected by the NATO

00:44:13.369 --> 00:44:19.170
air forces end up toppling Qaddafi’s government
and eventually catching him and executing

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.990
him in a very brutal way.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:27.800
So Putin blames Medvedev for letting this
happen, and any chances Medvedev had of continuing

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.560
as president after one term, if there really
had been a chance of that, clearly were over

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.560
at that point.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.730
MICHAEL KIRK - And how does Putin—there's
a story of a great gathering at a stadium

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:43.039
or something where people are waiting to see
will Medvedev stay or go.

00:44:43.039 --> 00:44:44.039
…

00:44:44.039 --> 00:44:47.620
PETER BAKER - Well, there had been the suspense,
and it may have been manufactured, but there

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:52.820
was a suspense about whether or not Putin
would come back after one term.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.870
He only switched the prime ministership for
one term in order to satisfy the constitution,

00:44:56.870 --> 00:45:00.060
which, in theory, says you can't have more
than two consecutive terms.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.570
He didn't really want to give up power.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.820
But there were people who thought, well, maybe
he’ll use this as a way of riding off into

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.040
the sunset, and he won't actually push Medvedev
out.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.100
So there's this party conference, the United
Russia Party, that has been a creation of

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:22.330
Putin and his people from the beginning, and
they're gathered in this hall and waiting

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:25.640
for the word from the great one.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.170
And Medvedev looks distraught.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:32.630
He’s been told he’s out, basically, and
he has to come out and basically announce

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:38.390
his own execution and say, in fact, it’s
better off for Russia if he were to step down

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.570
and to return Vladimir Putin to the presidency.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.470
He goes along with it, because what choice
does he have?

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:51.230
But it’s the mark of who really is in charge
of Russia that is played out in this very

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.470
orchestrated and very almost Soviet kind of
way.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.660
MICHAEL KIRK - And the people hit the streets.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.270
PETER BAKER - And the people hit the streets.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:02.700
And to Putin, this again is proof of American
perfidy.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.540
This is the CIA stirring things up, trying
to finally have that color revolution he’s

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.080
always feared in the streets of Moscow.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.590
Never mind that tens of thousands, hundreds
of thousands of Russians may have genuinely

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:19.000
disagreed with his coming back to power, that
they may have genuinely wanted to take the

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.260
country in a different way.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.300
It can't possibly be that Russians are opposed
to him.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.400
It has to be the CIA; it has to be Obama;
it has to be Hillary Clinton.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:33.460
He specifically singles out Hillary Clinton,
then secretary of state, for encouraging and,

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.920
in his mind, mobilizing this opposition to
him, and—

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.300
MICHAEL KIRK - Why?

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.930
PETER BAKER - Well, she had said something
publicly—I've forgotten exactly what she

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:47.040
said—but she said something publicly basically
embracing the aspirations of everyday Russians

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:53.200
to express themselves or something relatively
benign but typically American.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:58.140
But to him, that was proof that she was out
there, actually the puppet master pulling

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.270
the strings.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:06.030
How much he really believed that, how much
of that was convenience for him to do what

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.040
he would then do, is open to debate, I suppose.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.890
But there's no question that he and Hillary
Clinton didn't get along.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:17.910
He doesn't think much of strong women leaders,
I think, to begin with.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.680
She definitely didn't think much of him.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:25.070
She went along with the reset, but she was
one of the voices inside the Obama administration

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.119
who were pretty skeptical of it from the beginning.

00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:34.230
She saw Putin as this kind of thuggish figure
who she would mock him for sitting in meetings

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:41.730
with his legs spread wide and trying to dominate
the conversation, and she had seen men like

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:42.730
that her whole life.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.349
So she didn't think much of him, and it was
mutual.

00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:53.380
So for him, Hillary Clinton was a convenient
person to hold up as the enemy who was creating

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.380
this trouble for him.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:59.440
It couldn’t possibly be his own people didn't
want him; it had to be the result of the Americans.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:07.690
MICHAEL KIRK - When he wins re-election, and
we've had people say a really much firmer,

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:14.630
much stronger, much more authoritarian Vladimir
Putin takes office in 2012.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:18.410
PETER BAKER - Yeah, I think that's true, but
I think it’s of a piece.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.450
It's not like suddenly he became authoritarian.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:25.180
It’s that he is in a stronger position,
and in a stronger position he decided to keep

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.190
moving down the path he had been moving on
from the beginning.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:34.130
His economy was in better shape thanks to
oil over the past decade.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:37.350
You know, they cast off all the old Soviet
debt.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:42.020
They had gotten rid of a lot of the shackles
that they had felt on the international stage,

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:46.880
and he was ready at this point to reassert
Russia as a global player in a way that he

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.480
couldn’t do in his first term when he was
consumed with simply trying to consolidate

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.890
his own power and to lift the Russian economy
up.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:49:00.240
MICHAEL KIRK - And in 2012, this longstanding
feeling of inferiority to the United States

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.560
of America is ameliorated somewhat?

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.950
Or how’s he feeling about that struggle?

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:13.470
PETER BAKER - Well, I think he feels by that
point that Russia is strong enough to prove

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:18.430
itself again, that it’s shown that it was
a big world player.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.609
He had this idea: They were going to host
the Olympics; he was going to be the maestro

00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:29.420
on the stage, dozens of world leaders coming
to him while he was showcasing Sochi, his

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:34.110
resort city in the south.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:35.110
And he was ready.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:41.040
He was ready in his mind to take a more active
role on the world stage, feeling that he had

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.829
basically shown at home that he was the person
in charge.

00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:44.829
…

00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:49.770
MICHAEL KIRK - If you don’t mind, step back
into another period [September 2004], mostly

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:55.060
because I'm interested in what it tells us
about him, as Americans learning about him

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.330
at that moment.

00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:03.810
PETER BAKER - Well, in September of 2004,
school opens all across Russia, and in a town

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:11.191
called Beslan in the south, a group of mainly
Chechen rebels seizes the local school, and

00:50:11.191 --> 00:50:15.140
for the next three days they hold it hostage
while Vladimir Putin is left in Moscow to

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.150
figure out what to do.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:22.140
Now, there's been more terrorism in Russia
over the previous three or four years than

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.280
anywhere in the world with the exception of
9/11.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.980
Most Americans don’t recognize that, but
he had been fighting a war on terror of his

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:36.710
own for years, bloody, terrible incidents
in subways and hospitals and a theater in

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:37.810
Moscow.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:46.900
So when the school seizure happens, it captivates
the world, and it brings home the horrific

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.359
consequences of what had been happening in
Russia these previous years.

00:50:49.359 --> 00:50:57.110
All these schoolchildren are basically held
at gunpoint in an auditorium, in a gymnasium,

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:01.430
as the government in Moscow tries to figure
out what to do.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:12.660
I'll never forget being down there and watching
the terrible climax of this crisis, when the

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:20.250
Russian troops basically fire on the school,
and parents are rushing in to the gymnasium

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.540
to try to rescue their kids, and it’s just
bedlam.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:36.220
One hundred eighty children die, 300-and-some
total people.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:42.140
As a reporter who’s been to Iraq and Afghanistan
and Chechnya, it’s the worst thing I ever

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.490
saw.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:51.420
And it traumatized a nation, as you can imagine—schoolchildren
held hostage, killed by a bloody battle between

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.020
their government and terrorists.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.080
Why couldn’t they have solved it?

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.480
Why couldn’t they have had a peaceful outcome?

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.530
How did this happen?

00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:58.530
…

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:05.310
MICHAEL KIRK - Is there a sort of behind-closed-doors
fight about what to do before the assault,

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.140
and is Putin—?

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:14.110
PETER BAKER - They sent a negotiator who had
worked with Chechens in the past; they didn’t

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.470
get anywhere.

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:23.180
I mean, there was no deal, and Putin didn’t
want to make a deal.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:30.880
You know, he’s a tough guy, stand up to
terrorists.

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.720
It was a standoff to no end, you know.

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:40.810
And these parents are just surrounding the
school for days trying to figure out what's

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:42.720
happening, trying to get any information they
could.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:47.480
And a tiny little town, everybody had a kid
in that school or knew somebody who had a

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.880
kid in that school.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:55.200
It was just the most horrifying thing you
can imagine.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.200
And out of this tragedy Vladimir Putin sees
opportunity.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.310
He says the reason this happened is because
we showed weakness.

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:08.340
We showed weakness, and he was not going to
allow that to happen again.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.340
He was not going to show weakness.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:12.010
He was going to show strength.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:18.480
And out of this, he decides to eliminate the
election of all governors across Russia, all

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.720
89 regions and provinces of Russia.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.720
Their governors will now be appointed by Vladimir
Putin and confirmed by local legislatures.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720
Why?

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:34.160
I mean, why does the governor of Irkutsk out
in Siberia need to be appointed by the president

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.020
to fight terrorism in the Caucuses?

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.020
He never explains.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.930
But it’s an opportunity for him to assert
more power, to assert more control.

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:45.660
And Russians more or less go along with it.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:55.980
One of the newspapers that publicized contrary
information about this episode were punished.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:03.270
I remember there was a big debate about how
many hostages were being held inside the school,

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:08.120
and the government basically kept trying to
downplay or even lie about how many were actually

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120
in there.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:15.290
At one point, you know, people would hold
up signs behind television news cameras to

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:21.030
get out the real information that there were
like 1,200 people in that gymnasium or whatever,

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.820
because the state-owned television wasn't
telling the truth.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:28.930
It’s an opportunity for Putin, again, to
crack down: to crack down on the media; to

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:34.730
crack down on independent voices; to crack
down on democracy.

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:41.380
And it’s not the first time in history that
an autocratic leader has used a terrible event

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:46.140
like terrorism to increase power, but this
is a classic example of it.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.950
MICHAEL KIRK - From the American perspective,
what did the Bush people think when they—about

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:51.950
Putin?

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.349
What did they learn about Putin from that
event?

00:54:54.349 --> 00:55:00.859
PETER BAKER - Well, I think by that point
they were pretty cynical about him to begin

00:55:00.859 --> 00:55:01.859
with.

00:55:01.859 --> 00:55:04.070
They saw him more and more for what he was.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:09.750
Beslan was the latest in a string of episodes
where Putin had basically demonstrated that

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:18.490
he didn't much care for Western ideas of economic
or political freedom; that for them, I think

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:24.320
it just sort of reinforced this increasing
concern on their part that Putin was drifting

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:30.680
toward authoritarianism and away from the
Yeltsin legacy he had inherited.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.680
…

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.730
MICHAEL KIRK - … Tell us a little bit about
why he was so willing to spend $51 billion,

00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:40.680
or whatever it was, to do [the Sochi Winter
Olympics] and what had been going on the month

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:45.020
prior to that starting in late November down
in Kiev.

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:49.450
PETER BAKER - Well, the contrast between the
Olympics and what happened in Ukraine is just

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:57.970
stunning, right, because for Putin, hosting
the Olympics is the crescendo of his campaign

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:04.870
to revive Russian greatness; to show the world
that Russia was a first-rate power, that Russia

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:11.710
was capable of hosting an Olympics, and that
it was to be respected and admired around

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:12.710
the world.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:22.270
He was going to have leaders from all corners
of the globe descend on Sochi under his hospitality

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:23.270
to watch the Olympics.

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:24.680
And it was a big moment.

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.609
He was willing to spend anything to make that
happen.

00:56:26.609 --> 00:56:30.880
Sochi was a pretty down-and-out resort town
before he started pouring tens of billions

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.250
of dollars into it.

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:36.099
But, you know, in typical Russian fashion,
people took their cut, and a lot of people

00:56:36.099 --> 00:56:37.099
got rich off of it.

00:56:37.099 --> 00:56:43.200
But it did transform Sochi into a very unlikely
setting, by the way, for these Olympics into

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.589
a venue that more or less worked.

00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:49.250
There was a lot of skepticism in the weeks
leading up to it that the Russians could pull

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:50.480
it off.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.310
But they did, and it was a pretty reasonable
show.

00:56:55.310 --> 00:57:01.490
And there was Putin grinning and prideful
and having accomplished what he wanted to

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:02.490
accomplish.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:09.940
But at the very same moment of his triumph
is seeded this conflict that's about to start

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.599
that would completely unravel everything he
had just done.

00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:19.540
To the extent that he wanted to be the big
player in the world, at that very moment there

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:25.820
was a clash starting—not really starting,
but climaxing in Ukraine that would undercut

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.470
all $50 billion, basically, of free PR.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:29.470
Not free PR—

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:34.920
It would basically undercut all $50 billion
of PR in effect he had just bought.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:42.410
For months, Ukraine had been talking with
the European Union about a trade agreement

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:46.660
that would basically further its economic
ties with the West.

00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.750
This is a threat from Putin's point of view.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:55.050
This is more of the same as far as he’s
concerned of the West trying to infiltrate

00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:06.680
his territory, and his mission is to stop
this, and he basically counteroffers to the

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:13.880
government of Ukraine: He’ll give them $25
billion worth of credit if they give up the

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.880
EU agreement.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.980
And they agree because it’s a pro-Russian
government in there to begin with, and Russia

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:23.220
is—Putin is basically putting his foot down.

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.480
“No, you can't do this.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.720
You're too central to who we are.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.080
It's one thing to let the Balts go away; they
were never very Russian to begin with.

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.340
Ukraine is at the heart of Russia's identity.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.660
It’s the heart of Russia's history.

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:39.400
The idea that it’s going to drift off to
Europe while we just sit there?”

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.400
Unthinkable to Putin.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:51.140
MICHAEL KIRK - The phone call from Ambassador
Nuland, or from Victoria Nuland, to the American

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:54.460
ambassador in Ukraine, it is intercepted.

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:59.420
Can you remember the meaning and the effect
of this?

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.420
PETER BAKER - Yeah.

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.470
You have her telling the story?

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.780
MICHAEL KIRK - Yes.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:09.980
PETER BAKER - What's interesting about that,
of course, is every American knows that these

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.530
conversations are being intercepted.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.760
Russians are pretty good at that, and they
recognize when they're outside of their secure

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:21.760
environment that they're likely to be overheard.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:25.099
What's different about this is for Russia
to put it out there, for them to leak this

00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:27.630
conversation so that the world could hear.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:33.570
That was a little bit of a different thing
for the Americans, and that, I think, woke

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:39.800
them up a little bit to what Russia saw in
this: The consequences were big; that they

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:44.740
were going to play hard, and they were going
to play on multiple levels, and they were

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:51.770
going to do what they could to undercut the
United States and Europe with at least the

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:54.060
Russian sympathetic Ukrainian population.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:57.369
MICHAEL KIRK - You mean the playing back of
it out loud, I mean, it’s espionage.

00:59:57.369 --> 00:59:59.380
It's espionage, but it’s when you reveal
the espionage—

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.260
PETER BAKER - It’s when you reveal it, right.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.260
That's not usual.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:06.530
I mean, they tape Americans all the time,
and Americans tape them all the time.

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:07.540
It’s putting it out there.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:12.130
And that was a real shot across the bow.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:15.119
I think Toria Nuland took it that way; she
understood it that way.

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:16.700
MICHAEL KIRK - It's a new day in some way.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:21.050
PETER BAKER - It's a new day, and we're going
to play on multiple levels, you know?

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:24.920
We're going to use all kinds of different
tools to counter you.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920
…

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.300
MICHAEL KIRK - … The word from the people
on the ground from the United States, State

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.099
Department and other places, are saying: “We’ve
got to do something about this.

01:00:33.099 --> 01:00:34.320
We've got to arm these people.”

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.390
And a debate rages.

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:39.960
It goes all the way up to the president of
the United States.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.850
To the extent that you know very much about
it, tell me what you know and what the sides

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:51.140
of the debate are and what the result of the
argument is.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:59.800
PETER BAKER - Obama responds to Ukraine by
imposing sanctions and by working closely

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.470
with the Europeans to keep a unified front.

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:05.960
They kick Russia out of the G-8.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.020
They suspend military cooperation with the
Russian military.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.619
They suspend a bunch of different interactions.

01:01:14.619 --> 01:01:19.180
And they begin to penalize Russian businesses
and Russian individuals that they blame for

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.830
being part of this.

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:25.760
But what they will not do is send arms to
the Ukrainians, and there are people inside

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.070
his administration who want to do that.

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:34.150
People like Toria Nuland, people like others
who have been more hawkish inside the administration

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:39.180
wanted to at least consider the idea of sending
arms to the Ukrainians that would go beyond

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.210
even the defensive equipment that Obama eventually
did approve.

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:46.410
And Obama didn’t want to do that.

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:50.470
That wasn't his playbook.

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:56.850
He’s very wary, as president, of getting
the United States more involved in military

01:01:56.850 --> 01:01:57.850
ventures overseas.

01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:02.390
That’s a consequence, from his point of
view, of what happened with Bush and what

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:08.250
he saw as happening in Libya, which to him
didn't work out well.

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:15.260
So his view is that sending arms to Ukrainians
isn't going to be enough to change the dynamics

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:20.540
on the battlefield; that the Russians are
always going to have stronger position in

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:25.680
eastern Ukraine than the Americans will, and
therefore it would only be provocative and

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.250
potentially blow the situation up even worse
than it already was.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:33.570
Now, the people, the advocates inside the
administration said: “You have to help these

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:34.570
people.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:36.430
These people deserve to be able to defend
themselves.

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:42.099
How can you not support a friend who’s being
attacked by an outside power?

01:02:42.099 --> 01:02:49.470
Don’t they have the right to defend themselves,
and shouldn’t we do something about that?”

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:50.900
But Obama wouldn’t be moved.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.250
He was very strong on that.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:56.690
To him, the most important priority was keeping
tight with the Europeans.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:01.800
There couldn’t be any daylight between the
United States and Europe.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.240
While the United States could have imposed
tougher sanctions or sent arms, he didn't

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.990
want to get so far out in front of the Europeans
that anybody could exploit that difference.

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:14.940
So in effect, it was always going to be a
kind of common denominator policy.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.430
How far were the Germans willing to go?

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:18.510
How far were the French willing to go?

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:19.780
That's how far we’ll go.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:25.720
MICHAEL KIRK - Some of the people we talked
to say: “Yeah, but you've got—what are

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.910
you going to do about Putin?

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:29.790
He's getting pretty big for his britches.

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.780
Here, we really do have bully actions.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:38.290
Don’t you have to send a message to a guy
like that, that this is the line in the sand?”

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:42.040
PETER BAKER - Certainly there are a lot of
people in Washington who think that you need

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.550
to punch a Putin in the nose in order to get
his attention; that he’s a person who only

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:51.000
understands strength; that he perceives weakness
on the part of the United States; that he

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.132
perceives weakness on the part of President
Obama, and he’s going to continue to take

01:03:54.132 --> 01:03:57.470
advantage of that and push that as far as
he can.

01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:03.510
I think there's no question that Putin took
his measure of Obama and decided Obama was

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:05.130
not strong, that Obama was weak.

01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:10.010
That may not be fair, and it may not be true,
but I do think that's what Putin saw, and

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:11.260
that influenced his actions.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.350
That told him that he could do what he did
in eastern Ukraine.

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:24.810
Now, I would say that you can make the argument
that while the West did not roll back the

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:31.681
Crimea annexation, the West perhaps did succeed
in preventing Putin from going further in

01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.880
eastern Ukraine than he might have wanted
to go.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:39.970
I think Putin was surprised by the fact that
he did not actually meet with more success

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:46.540
in eastern Ukraine than he thought he would;
that in fact he really only had enough support

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.020
among the local population to take a relatively
small amount of the territory, not all of

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.700
eastern Ukraine as he might have hoped for.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:59.830
He became blocked, in effect, from going further
but unwilling to retreat.

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:04.869
And now he created this sort of frozen conflict
where it just kind of remains at a standstill,

01:05:04.869 --> 01:05:09.869
and he has a small slice of eastern Ukraine.

01:05:09.869 --> 01:05:17.730
And he’s done it without feeling—without
being punished, in his view.

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:21.660
The sanctions became a mark of a badge of
honor in his way.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:26.650
He turned that to his advantage domestically
to say, “See, the West is out to get us.”

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.510
But on the other hand, he did run up to a
limit.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.810
There was a limit to how far he could or would
go.

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:37.000
MICHAEL KIRK - There are some people who say
this is the moment where Putin can lean back

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.070
and say: “Well, I have their full attention
or almost full attention.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:46.920
I'm at least, if it’s not a bipolar or tripolar
world, or whatever it is, here I am.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.680
Lot of people know about Russia now that didn't
know or think—give a hoot for Russia 17

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.180
years ago or 16 years ago.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.300
Here I am.”

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.570
PETER BAKER - I think that's what Obama's
playing to when he says while on a trip to

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:00.890
Europe, “Well, Russia's just a regional
power.”

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.890
He’s actually—

01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:03.210
MICHAEL KIRK - Tell me that story.

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:04.390
Take me there for that.

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:11.180
PETER BAKER - In the very beginning of, well
not the very—as Russia is intervening in

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:15.220
Ukraine, President Obama goes to Europe and
meets with other European leaders.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.640
He’s asked at a press conference about what's
going on Ukraine, and he kind of dismisses

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.640
it.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.510
He kind of says—he’s not dismissing the
Russia intervention, but he’s dismissing

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:25.510
Russia as a power.

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:27.380
He said, “Well, it's a regional power.”

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:32.609
And boy, that's just intended to drive Putin
crazy, right?

01:06:32.609 --> 01:06:39.190
It's dismissive; it’s humiliating in some
ways to Putin, the idea that they're just

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:43.720
a regional power; they’re a small player
on the world stage, and Obama represents the

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.720
United States.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.400
MICHAEL KIRK - It's like his JV comment on
ISIS, right?

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.970
PETER BAKER - Well, it’s interesting.

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:57.110
So is it a miscalculation by Obama, an underestimation
of what Putin really represents, or is it

01:06:57.110 --> 01:06:58.410
an attempt to control him?

01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:02.340
Is it an attempt to apply the shiv a little
bit?

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.180
But it certainly doesn't go over well in the
Kremlin, and it’s certainly the kind of

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.810
thing that Putin would get aggravated by.

01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:10.810
MICHAEL KIRK - And remember.

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:11.810
PETER BAKER - And remember.

01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:12.810
NOTE chapter The Reset and Arab Spring: Putin
as Prime Minister // 2008-2011

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:16.670
MICHAEL KIRK - We had somebody, and he said
that every meeting with Putin always starts

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:19.510
with 25 to 45 minutes of grievances.

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:21.280
You never get a chance to get a word in, right?

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.280
PETER BAKER - Exactly.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.110
Well, that was the first meeting they had,
by the way, in 2009.

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:28.950
So in July 2009, Obama goes to Moscow, and
it’s part of the reset.

01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:31.500
They come up with some things, by the way,
that are important.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.020
There were some successes of the reset.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.020
It's easy to forget that now.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.280
They got a nuclear arms treaty.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.580
They got the right to transit American troops
through Russian air space to Afghanistan to

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.870
our bases north of Afghanistan.

01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:47.510
That's not a small thing.

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:50.640
They did get Russia into the WTO [World Trade
Organization], which was an attempt to bring

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.420
it more into the international set of rules.

01:07:54.420 --> 01:08:00.130
So there were moments early on where the reset
did provide some successes.

01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:04.480
But this meeting in July 2009, I think, harbingers
what's to come.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.780
President Obama makes his visit about meeting
with Medvedev because he’s the president.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.430
We're going to talk president to president.

01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:14.089
But of course he has to also meet with Putin,
who’s the prime minister at the time.

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:19.580
They sit down for the first time as leader
to leader to meet, and Obama makes some kind

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.270
of comment to the effect of “I know you
have some concerns about the way the United

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.040
States has behaved in the past,” or something
like that.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.560
And it sets Putin off.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:35.690
He heads off to the races, 45, 60 minutes
of complaining and grievance, and you did

01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:38.339
this, and you did that.

01:08:38.339 --> 01:08:41.130
That tells Obama everything he needs to know
about Putin.

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:42.130
MICHAEL KIRK - And what is that?

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:47.750
PETER BAKER - That this is somebody who is,
in his mind, locked in the past, who is nursing

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:54.069
resentment and who is going to never be a
full partner of the United States.

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:56.900
So Obama tries to marginalize him within Russia.

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:02.040
It doesn't succeed, but he understands that
Putin is never going to be a friend.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:10.440
MICHAEL KIRK - It’s 2016, 2015 really, into
’16.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:19.069
Perhaps revenge gets initiated in some small
way with [Fancy] Bear and Cozy Bear and hacking

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:20.069
the DNC.

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:27.640
The FBI is the first to pick it up.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.109
What is Putin doing then, do you think?

01:09:30.109 --> 01:09:32.500
Is Putin even doing it?

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:38.680
PETER BAKER - It's hard to imagine this is
happening without Putin knowing about it and

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.569
authorizing it.

01:09:40.569 --> 01:09:47.230
I think they're trying to stir the pot, you
know.

01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:52.600
It’s not new, but what's new about it is
the extent of it and the means through which

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.320
they're able to use to do it.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.520
The Russians have always wanted to keep the
West off balance.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.940
This is a way of doing it in a more sophisticated,
21st-century way.

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:10.170
We're going to hack into your systems; we're
going to find out your secrets; we're going

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:11.840
to expose them to the world.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:18.040
I think he’s doing it to keep the United
States off balance.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.850
I don't think he actually necessarily thinks
he’s going to actually change the outcome

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:29.500
of the election, but keeping the U.S. off
balance is a pretty good goal, from his point

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.500
of view anyway.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:37.350
MICHAEL KIRK - And you get into the DNC, and
this satisfies a certain anti-Hillary motivational

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:38.350
imperative, too.

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:40.330
PETER BAKER - Yeah, there's no question he’s
looking at revenge at Hillary Clinton.

01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:48.480
There's no question that he sees Hillary Clinton
as an adversary, as somebody who if got in

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.080
office would be a problem for him.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.150
And he wanted to get her back.

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:57.580
It’s not that he believed that she actually
did have something to do with the protests

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:02.360
in Moscow against him from a few years earlier;
this is his opportunity to take a little bit

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360
of payback.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.969
MICHAEL KIRK - … Why, from what you can
tell us, has the White House not fully engaged

01:11:09.969 --> 01:11:13.850
and bringing this either to the attention
of the American people or fighting back?

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:16.690
PETER BAKER - Well, there are a couple of
things going on in the White House at that

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:17.690
time.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:25.160
First of all, Barack Obama is leery of looking
like he’s trying to influence the election

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.400
by complaining about the Russians too loudly.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.800
He thinks the election’s actually going
his way anyway, right?

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.630
Hillary Clinton seems to be ahead.

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:37.690
She seems likely to win over this guy, Donald
Trump.

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:43.239
You know, why should they mess up things when
things are heading in the right direction?

01:11:43.239 --> 01:11:47.170
… There's also this concern at the White
House at the time that the Russians had something

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:51.570
bigger in mind; that it wasn't just about
harvesting some emails and putting them out

01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:55.690
there and embarrassing candidates, but [that]
they actually had something in mind on Election

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:59.380
Day itself; that they would try to influence
the machines, the voting process itself.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:05.190
They were focused on working with the states
to prevent that.

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:09.300
That was at the top of their head.

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.590
And publicizing it.

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:12.010
They did publicize it to some extent.

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:13.590
They would tell you they did.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:18.750
But they obviously didn't make it a big issue
at the time.

01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:22.360
It didn't take retaliatory steps until after
the election.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.600
And there was a big debate about that.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.130
There were people inside the administration,
[Secretary of State] John Kerry and others,

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:31.610
who were pushing to say let's get out there
and make this a bigger issue.

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.860
This is an attack on our democracy.

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:38.820
And Obama's cautious side prevailed.

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:46.190
He was wary of something that would be provocative
and that in his mind might boomerang.

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:53.180
MICHAEL KIRK - And Donald Trump's response
in the first moments when the word is out:

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:56.540
“Hey, it seems to be Russia hacking our
election”?

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.580
PETER BAKER - Right.

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.980
His response is to invite them to do it more.

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:03.880
He says, “Hey, Russia, if you're listening,
maybe you can find those missing Hillary Clinton

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.920
emails.”

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:10.239
He doesn't see this as a fundamental attack
by an adversary.

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:15.730
He sees this as just part of the circus of
American democracy, a part of the circus of

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:22.219
an election process, and he’s playing to
the circus.

01:13:22.219 --> 01:13:28.960
What his motivations are is still really the
biggest mystery, I think, of this whole affair.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.570
What he’s really thinking, how much of it
is thought through, how much of it is just

01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:38.670
gut instinct at any particular moment, it’s
hard to say.

01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:45.810
But his comments about Putin, his comments
about Russia from the beginning, are so drastically

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:50.260
different than the bipartisan consensus in
Washington that it has invited skepticism.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.860
It has invited suspicion about what he was
thinking and why he was saying things like

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.110
that.

01:13:55.110 --> 01:14:00.100
MICHAEL KIRK - From what you can tell, what
does he think of Putin?

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.380
What does he say about Putin?

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:04.690
PETER BAKER - Well, he seemed to admire Putin
as a strong figure.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:08.670
He even said during the campaign that Putin's
a stronger leader than President Obama.

01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:13.730
Now, part of that's a way of digging at Obama,
but that's an extraordinary thing to say even

01:14:13.730 --> 01:14:21.210
against a president of another party, to hold
up a strongman, authoritarian leader of Russia

01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:25.780
as a role model over the American leader.

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:34.200
He seems to respect Putin as a figure of—that
he sees being like him, you know, who doesn’t

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:46.800
take guff from anybody, who is a dominant
figure, who is everything that Obama's not.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.760
There seemed to be an affinity there.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.480
He says at various points: “Well, I don't
know him.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.640
I don’t really have a sense of him.”

01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.230
They actually have met more than he had let
on or whatever.

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:07.800
But largely, he seems to be taking on at least
the public image of Putin as one that he finds

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800
admirable.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.470
MICHAEL KIRK - And Putin's thoughts about
Trump at that moment?

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.810
Does he really think he can win?

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:21.110
PETER BAKER - It would be easy to overestimate
Russia's understanding of our political system,

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:26.290
because they often have very, very distorted
view of things.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:31.300
But it’s hard to imagine that many people
in Moscow thought that Donald Trump was going

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:36.710
to win since nobody else did, right?

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:45.250
They read the same things that we read, and
they see the same polls and the same pundits.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.260
But it may not have mattered if he actually
won.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:51.180
Again, I think part of the goal was really
disruption, just sort of “We're screwing

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:57.350
with you,” rather than actually necessarily
dictating an outcome.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:01.440
But you can argue it didn't work for them,
because certainly the way things have played

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.770
out has not worked to Russia's benefit.

01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:10.060
It’s become such a big issue that their
goal of getting sanctions lifted, their goal

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:16.830
of undercutting American and European opposition
to what they're doing in Ukraine, it’s been

01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:19.730
sabotaged to some extent by this very investigation.

01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:27.180
It’s politically impossible for Trump at
this point to lift sanctions against Russia,

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:28.870
even if he thought it was the right thing
to do.

01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:36.340
MICHAEL KIRK - Just sort of telling the story,
Trump wins.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:41.090
Suddenly all of his guys, [Gen. Michael] Flynn,
even [Jared] Kushner, all through that period

01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:43.489
are having connections.

01:16:43.489 --> 01:16:47.880
Are they different than [what] happened to
any other White House?

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.880
…

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.920
PETER BAKER - Well, look, talking to Russia's
ambassador is not by itself anything scandalous.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.730
That's what ambassadors do, and we even have
a program to send ambassadors to the political

01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:03.860
conventions during election years so that
they can understand our process and so forth.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:09.860
What makes it odd and what's raised so many
suspicions is the fact that there were so

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:17.540
many of these contacts with so many different
folks around President Trump and that they

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.930
were not always disclosed.

01:17:18.930 --> 01:17:23.100
You know, it wasn't that the attorney general,
[Jeff] Sessions, met with Ambassador [Sergey]

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:27.810
when put that was the problem; it was the
fact that he didn't disclose it that became

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.190
such an issue.

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.949
What was said during these conversations is
obviously important, too.

01:17:31.949 --> 01:17:37.770
I think you saw the Obama people at the end
of their time growing increasingly alarmed

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:41.252
at some of these contacts, not just because
they were happening, but because there was

01:17:41.252 --> 01:17:48.500
a feeling that perhaps there was deal making
going on before Trump even got into office.

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.500
…

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.650
MICHAEL KIRK - … It’s post-election, time
for transition, time for Kerry to talk to

01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:57.880
[Rex] Tillerson, time for the people in the
crash teams to talk to [the incoming members

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.830
of the administration] and say, “Here's
where the stove is hot,” and “Here's where…”—and

01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:03.630
pass off all the institutional knowledge.

01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:07.180
To a person, they sit in here, from [Ambassador]
Toria [Nuland] to [John Kerry’s Chief of

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:12.830
Staff Jon] Finer, say nobody ever came; nobody
ever talked to us; nobody wanted to know anything

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:14.380
about this.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:23.320
What does that say in the general, and in
the specific, about Russia and Putin?

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:29.860
PETER BAKER - Every new administration comes
in thinking they're hot stuff and they don’t

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.100
need to talk to the old administration because
they know better.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:37.300
They wouldn’t have been elected if they
weren't so smart.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.420
But there did seem to be a sort of willful
desire on the part of this administration

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.880
not to talk to the Obama people about the
very subject that was at the heart of this

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.380
big controversy, which is Russia.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.690
Secretary of State Kerry did not get called
by Rex Tillerson.

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:58.050
He didn't talk—none of the national security
people had significant conversations with

01:18:58.050 --> 01:19:00.980
their counterparts about this as far as we
can tell.

01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:03.390
And it raises the question about why.

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:07.460
Wouldn’t you at least want to understand
what the old people had experienced before

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.590
deciding what your policy was going to be
coming in?

01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:18.090
It suggests the new administration, a, didn't
have much respect for the old one, and b,

01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:23.750
pretty much had in mind what it was going
to do anyway and didn't see the need for contrary

01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:24.750
advice.

01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:28.440
MICHAEL KIRK - Does it tell us anything about
how they want to approach Russia and Putin?

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:33.860
PETER BAKER - There's no question that President
Trump came in intending to restore relations

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.489
with President Putin and Russia.

01:19:35.489 --> 01:19:43.110
There's no question that he wanted from the
very beginning to throw out a lot of the old

01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:45.570
baggage and start over again, in effect.

01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:50.170
It’s not that different than what President
Clinton and President Bush and President Obama

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:56.190
wanted to do, except that the context is so
different and that President Trump's desire

01:19:56.190 --> 01:20:01.520
to do it is so maximal that he’s willing
to overlook so many things that his predecessors

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.030
wouldn’t have overlooked, even in their
desire to improve relations.

01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:11.280
For instance, when Bill O’Reilly asks President
Trump, “Well, isn't Putin a killer?,”

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.760
and Trump defends him and says, you know,
“Not only is Putin OK, but hey, we’ve

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:21.580
got nothing to talk about, too; we're killers,
too,” that's so far beyond what previous

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:26.880
presidents would ever have said, even desiring
to create a new relationship with Russia.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.430
That's why people are suspicious.

01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:34.980
Why would you go out of your way to defend
Vladimir Putin in such an expansive way, rather

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.570
than say something like, “Well, look, we
don’t agree on some things, but it’s important

01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:39.570
for us to get along”?

01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:43.770
That would be the more traditional way a president,
even a new president, would take to this kind

01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:44.770
of situation.

01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:51.900
Instead, Trump was embracing him; he was praising
him; he was defending him against critics.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:58.380
And that's just got Republicans and Democrats
both scratching their heads trying to figure

01:20:58.380 --> 01:20:59.380
out why.

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:12.110
MICHAEL KIRK - Then President Obama throws
out 35 Russian bureaucrats and closes down

01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:19.550
a couple of locations where apparently spying
and other things were taking place.

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:23.110
Michael Flynn picks up a phone and says what?

01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:25.710
What does he say to the Russian ambassador?

01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:31.980
PETER BAKER - Well, he's talking with Sergey
Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, and they

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:32.980
talk about sanctions.

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:38.460
By his own account, they talk about throwing
out the diplomats and these diplomatic properties.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.130
Now, he later says, “Well, I wasn't talking
about sanctions; I was talking about these

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.130
expulsions.”

01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:46.130
OK, that's a distinction that most people
didn't draw.

01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:52.480
But the fact that he didn't disclose that
that came up in the conversation right at

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.590
the same time that the Obama administration
was taking the action, that led to a lot of

01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:04.550
suspicion and concern, because what was he
doing at that point interacting with the Russians

01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:08.070
at the same time the existing administration
was penalizing it?

01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:10.280
It seemed designed to undercut it.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.790
It seemed designed to signal to the Russians
that, “Don’t worry; we're going to be

01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:16.780
in office in a few weeks; everything will
be OK.”

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:24.440
In fact, Vladimir Putin chooses not to retaliate
for the expelled Russian diplomats or the

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.830
closing down of these properties a day or
two later, which surprises everybody.

01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:34.730
That's almost unheard of, clearly in his mind
an expression of confidence that the next

01:22:34.730 --> 01:22:36.870
administration will make things better.

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:37.870
…

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.440
MICHAEL KIRK - This is the summary question.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.940
We've built this character, Vladimir Putin.

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:46.940
What does he want?

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.080
Why did he do this?

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:55.550
PETER BAKER - I think it comes back to where
we started, you know.

01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:59.300
He picked the biggest kid on the block; he
punched him in the nose to show that he can.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:03.320
And I think that he continues to want to punch
us.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:09.900
I think he wants to show again Russian greatness.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.810
He wants to show again Russian importance.

01:23:15.810 --> 01:23:16.810
And you know what?

01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:18.550
In some ways, he’s succeeded.

01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:21.190
He is, in fact, a player on the world stage.

01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:28.400
He hasn't succeeded in the sense that Russia
is genuinely a strong, prosperous member of

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.250
the international community, which is what
everybody had hoped for at the end of the

01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:35.490
Cold War, but he has succeeded in the sense
that nobody can ignore him.

01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:40.270
And if you ask people around the world to
name five world leaders, they’ll all know

01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:43.880
Trump's name, and they’ll all know Putin's
name.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:53.110
I think that he’s shown that you can't basically
ignore Vladimir Putin.

01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:54.110
…

01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:57.600
JIM GILMORE - Let’s talk a little bit about
Ukraine.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.290
Why was it so important?

01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:03.040
What did it mean to Putin to lose Ukraine?

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.040
…

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.260
PETER BAKER - Ukraine is part of Russia, as
far as Putin is concerned.

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:13.350
It’s in fact inimitable to the Russian identity
of itself as a great empire.

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:18.710
The idea that Ukraine was a separate country
is always anathema to nationalists like Putin,

01:24:18.710 --> 01:24:22.300
so the idea that it would be part of the West
was just too far removed.

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:25.940
It’s one thing for the Baltics to go that
way.

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:31.070
They hated that, but they were never genuinely
part of Russia as it saw itself.

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:35.330
Ukraine is part and parcel of the Russian
identity, in their view.

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:38.380
They never considered it a legitimately separate
country to begin with.

01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:42.460
JIM GILMORE - … When he took Crimea, … when
there was little response to that, did it

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:43.460
embolden him?

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:50.449
Did it allow him to move into Donbas and to
move into other parts of Ukraine?

01:24:50.449 --> 01:24:56.670
PETER BAKER - I do think once he had Crimea
so easily in his hands, it did embolden him.

01:24:56.670 --> 01:25:01.740
It did suggest to him that he could, in fact,
snatch whole sections of eastern Ukraine.

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:07.830
It was always the fear, Ukrainians of the
west, that the country could be split apart.

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:11.340
The Russian influence in the eastern part
of Ukraine has been strong traditionally.

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:14.650
[There are] more Russian speakers there than
any other part of the country.

01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:19.570
There was the idea, I think, in the Kremlin,
that of course eastern Ukraine would want

01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:22.739
to be part of Russia, or at least under Russia’s
umbrella.

01:25:22.739 --> 01:25:25.469
I think he ran into much more resistance than
he expected.

01:25:25.469 --> 01:25:29.850
It actually turned out to be a gamble that
was wrong, because in fact, when the Russians

01:25:29.850 --> 01:25:34.000
went into eastern Ukraine, they encountered
a much different resistance than they had

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
expected.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.501
If you look at the map today, the part of
eastern Ukraine that they do exercise influence

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:45.170
over, that did, in fact, go over to Russia
in a sense, is much smaller than I think most

01:25:45.170 --> 01:25:46.450
people would have expected at that time.

01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:52.060
JIM GILMORE - The tactics used when he goes
into eastern Ukraine, he uses some of the

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:53.380
same tactics.

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.290
Maybe you can clear this up for us.

01:25:56.290 --> 01:26:02.170
Is the use of “little green men” in eastern
Ukraine correct, or is that actually incorrect?

01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:05.750
PETER BAKER - It’s a phrase really thought
of more for Crimea.

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:10.601
In eastern Ukraine, what they do is they set
up a proxy army, in effect, of Russians or

01:26:10.601 --> 01:26:13.810
Russian speakers who are doing the fighting
for them.

01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:19.010
Russian soldiers are there, some of them on
leave or on vacation as they say, but it’s

01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:24.679
not the same sort of special commando kind
of operation that they pull off in Crimea.

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:31.150
JIM GILMORE - … What was the reaction of
the White House to what was going on?

01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:35.680
How were they, to some extent, stymied by
the tactics used by Putin?

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.160
PETER BAKER - Tell me where you're talking
about exactly.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.220
JIM GILMORE - We’re talking about during
Crimea, the time of Crimea, what is taking

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:43.220
place in Crimea.

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.410
PETER BAKER - The White House is basically
flummoxed.

01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:53.360
They had the first territorial land grab in
Europe since World War II by a big power.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.140
I think it stunned them.

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:56.980
It left them off guard.

01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:01.600
I think that while it had always been on everybody’s
list of terrible things that could happen,

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.640
it really wasn’t something they had imagined
really would.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.300
They were left trying to figure out what could
they do.

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.270
Obviously, there was not going to be a military
intervention.

01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:15.011
This is not a situation where the United States
was going to fly in the 82nd Airborne, but

01:27:15.011 --> 01:27:21.290
it couldn’t stand quietly while a sovereign
country was almost essentially invaded by

01:27:21.290 --> 01:27:23.219
its neighbor.

01:27:23.219 --> 01:27:25.800
Obama turned to Europe and said: “OK, this
is your neighborhood.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.750
What are we going to do about this?”

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:33.020
That was the crux of his strategy going forward,
is it had to be locked arm in arm with Europe

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.160
every step of the way.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.050
He wasn’t going to get further in front
of them, and he didn’t want them to get

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:39.050
further in front of him.

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:46.239
JIM GILMORE - But here's Putin, the leader
of Russia, is basically lying to him, and

01:27:46.239 --> 01:27:47.320
he knows he’s lying to him.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.370
But how does one deal with that?

01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:52.739
PETER BAKER - I think he’s gotten used to
the idea that Putin is not a truth teller.

01:27:52.739 --> 01:27:57.989
He’s gotten used to the idea that Putin’s
version of reality is not the same that anybody

01:27:57.989 --> 01:27:59.630
in the West would have.

01:27:59.630 --> 01:28:04.489
So it’s not a surprise that Putin is lying,
but it does make it more complicated, obviously,

01:28:04.489 --> 01:28:09.199
because you have to therefore establish on
the ground facts that everybody else might

01:28:09.199 --> 01:28:15.680
understand, but Russia, in its disinformation,
is trying to deny.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:21.361
There becomes this game of showing satellite
photos and trying to reveal some of the intelligence

01:28:21.361 --> 01:28:29.170
that the American agencies had without disclosing
sources and methods that might be compromising,

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:35.090
because the world is going to doubt American
assertions if they're not backed up.

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:40.440
That is part of the challenge for Obama going
in, is how to simply establish the facts on

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440
the ground.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.320
We don’t have an embassy in Crimea.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.030
We don’t have American presence in Crimea
of a substantial sort.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:55.160
There isn't a battery of television cameras
pointed at men with uniforms that say Russia

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.739
on it.

01:28:59.739 --> 01:29:03.920
The success of the Russian operation was to
at least give a plausible deniability that

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:09.570
lasts only a couple weeks, frankly, but enough
for them to take control and to establish

01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:13.180
new facts on the ground, and then to basically
say to the rest of the world, “Fine, deal

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.180
with it.”

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:16.199
JIM GILMORE - The March 18 speech by Putin—

01:29:16.199 --> 01:29:19.650
PETER BAKER - It’s the annexation speech?

01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:26.469
MICHAEL KIRK - Yeah, and how he basically
goes after the West.

01:29:26.469 --> 01:29:28.630
What does it show in Putin at that point?

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:31.530
Very emboldened by the situation?

01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:34.620
What message do we take from that?

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:37.890
PETER BAKER - … It shows an emboldened Putin,
but it also shows an aggrieved Putin.

01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:45.891
This is Putin at his most resentful, playing
into his longstanding sense that the West

01:29:45.891 --> 01:29:50.620
has taken Russia for a ride, that the West
has exploited Russian weakness, and they weren’t

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.780
going to stand for it anymore.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:30:00.940
He goes through this long litany of complaints
and examples where he thinks the West has

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:04.350
done Russia wrong, and this is payback.

01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:06.400
We’re not putting up with it anymore.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.670
This is Russia standing up for itself.

01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:10.830
You can't push us around anymore.

01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:15.840
JIM GILMORE - One last thing about Ukraine
is the MH17 [Malaysia Airlines] flight.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:25.400
Just describe the tactics used, the use of
fake news, how it worked, and how it uses

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:31.550
the tactics that he’s been honing for quite
a while—denial, fake news— … and how

01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:36.682
it in some ways foreshadows what is to come
in the United States.

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:40.920
PETER BAKER - … The shoot-down of the plane
showed how Russia plays the game on a global

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.920
level.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.410
They sow doubt.

01:30:43.410 --> 01:30:48.920
They sow disinformation in the broader information
stream so that there's just enough for people

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.429
to hang onto who don’t want to believe the
West.

01:30:51.429 --> 01:30:55.820
He offers other explanations that may seem
fanciful and far-fetched, ludicrous, really,

01:30:55.820 --> 01:31:03.550
to anybody in Washington or London or Berlin,
but it’s just enough for people who don’t

01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:06.760
support the governments in those countries
to say: “Well, maybe Russia is really being

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.450
unfairly accused here.

01:31:08.450 --> 01:31:09.590
Maybe it’s really something else.”

01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:13.180
It’s full of conspiracy, and it’s full
of paranoia.

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:20.890
It’s full of Hollywood-level nonsensical
narratives.

01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:25.989
“Aha, the Ukrainians are shooting down their
own people in order to frame us.”

01:31:25.989 --> 01:31:33.640
The real question is, how much does Putin
understand that this is nonsense?

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.760
How much does he believe it?

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:39.800
There's always been this question on the part
of American policymakers and presidents who

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:46.800
have dealt with Putin how much he really understands
that the stuff he spews is not related to

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:54.020
facts and how much he actually is buying it
himself.

01:31:54.020 --> 01:32:00.110
In Russia, there are enough conspiracies,
there are enough shadowy explanations for

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:04.150
strange events, that he sees things through
that lens.

01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:11.120
It is possible he sees, Putin, dark shadows
everywhere, because that’s the world he

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.590
lives in, and he assumes that the rest of
the world lives there and practices the same

01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:16.270
way he and his people do.

01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:19.469
JIM GILMORE - Of course he’s a KGB guy as
well.

01:32:19.469 --> 01:32:23.630
PETER BAKER - He’s a KGB guy, and he sees
everything through that lens.

01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:30.160
Everything is part of somebody’s agenda,
somebody’s subterranean operation, somebody’s

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:36.110
three-part bank shot to make us look bad.

01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:37.210
Sometimes you actually think he believes it.

01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:40.250
JIM GILMORE - … So how does this foreshadow
what's to come?

01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:44.910
We would never expect this kind of tactic
being used against us.

01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:46.370
But lo and behold…

01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:50.381
PETER BAKER - This is something that they
fine-tuned in Ukraine and then take it on

01:32:50.381 --> 01:32:54.900
the road when the United States has its election
in 2016.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:33:02.590
It uses all the tools at the Kremlin’s disposal:
the state-sponsored television that it beams

01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:12.960
into the West, the proxy groups, the Web trolls
and Twitter trolls, the cutouts and surrogates.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:20.091
They use all these tools in order to sow dissension,
to sow disruption, to sow doubt in the American

01:33:20.091 --> 01:33:21.310
election system.

01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:26.070
It’s not clear that Russians initially thought
they were going to necessarily change the

01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:31.719
outcome, But what they wanted to do, at the
very least, was disrupt our democracy.

01:33:31.719 --> 01:33:35.270
JIM GILMORE - So the election hack, let’s
do the elections.

01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:38.690
… How much of this was an intelligence failure?

01:33:38.690 --> 01:33:44.800
How much of it was a disbelief that the Russians
would be doing this or that maybe it was some

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:47.420
espionage, but everybody does that?

01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:53.760
Just tell us—define those early days leading
up to the DNC.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.100
What was going on?

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.449
PETER BAKER - That’s a good question.

01:33:57.449 --> 01:34:01.360
Clearly, in the early days and months, when
American intelligence agencies are beginning

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:07.719
to pick up on clues and signs, there is not
the sense of urgency or the sense of alarm

01:34:07.719 --> 01:34:13.480
that would later come to flavor this particular
issue.

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.800
I think that they didn’t know 100 percent
what they were dealing with.

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:21.810
They didn’t have a full explanation early
on of the extent of what Russia was trying

01:34:21.810 --> 01:34:26.330
to do, the purpose of what Russia was doing.

01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:32.101
And, you know, there's a lot going on at this
time, in terms of both the government and

01:34:32.101 --> 01:34:34.090
in terms of the campaign.

01:34:34.090 --> 01:34:37.480
You're a campaign official, and you're worried
about a million things.

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:41.300
Do you have enough money to put on television
ads in Michigan, and what's happening with

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:44.020
your opponent in Florida, and so forth.

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:49.219
Clearly, people did not take this seriously
enough early on, didn’t have either enough

01:34:49.219 --> 01:34:55.510
information or didn’t have enough cognizance
of the extent of what Russia was trying to

01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:56.510
do.

01:34:56.510 --> 01:35:01.239
JIM GILMORE - But eventually it becomes clear
that what Putin is doing here is weaponizing

01:35:01.239 --> 01:35:02.820
the information that’s already been hacked.

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.820
…

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.830
PETER BAKER - Russians have been spying on
Americans and American political figures for

01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:09.750
decades, and vice versa.

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:15.790
What they decided to do here was weaponize
the information to make it part of the campaign,

01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:24.989
not just simply a monitoring effort by the
Russians, but a concerted and willful effort

01:35:24.989 --> 01:35:34.780
to impact Americans’ view of their own system,
to throw off the politicians, and to confuse

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:37.260
and alienate the voters.

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:38.420
That’s different.

01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:42.261
That’s different than what we’ve seen
in the past.

01:35:42.261 --> 01:35:45.679
JIM GILMORE - … The reaction that Trump
had toward Putin throughout the campaign was

01:35:45.679 --> 01:35:55.360
supportive, was talking about how strong a
leader he is, and never deriding him, it seems,

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.270
in any way.

01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:59.350
How strange was that?

01:35:59.350 --> 01:36:02.090
What were the motivations behind it?

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:06.730
And [tell me about] how it leads, to some
extent, to the fact that people considered

01:36:06.730 --> 01:36:12.340
that there must be some conspiracy going on,
because it just seems so unnatural for an

01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:14.800
American leader to be acting this way.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.460
PETER BAKER - It was mystifying to listen
to Donald Trump talk about Vladimir Putin.

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:22.880
It wasn’t just that he was saying that America
needs better relations with Russia.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.850
That’s something that many politicians might
agree with.

01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:29.530
He was personally invested in the idea of
Putin as a friend.

01:36:29.530 --> 01:36:31.520
He said, “Maybe he’ll be my BFF.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:38.360
Maybe—,” and praising him to the point
where he would even defend Putin against anybody

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.770
who said any negative things about him.

01:36:40.770 --> 01:36:44.650
When interviewers would say he was a killer,
it was Trump leaping to his defense, saying:

01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:45.739
“Well, we all do that.

01:36:45.739 --> 01:36:49.440
Isn't that pretty normal for international
leaders?”

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.949
No American politician in modern times—no
major American politician hoping to win the

01:36:53.949 --> 01:37:00.790
White House, anyway—would embrace a person
like Vladimir Putin so aggressively and so

01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:03.000
unreservedly.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.820
Even George W. Bush wanted to see into his
soul and wanted to make friends with Vladimir

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:09.940
Putin, but he was pretty realistic about who
Putin was.

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:16.290
He publicly said that “We have concerns
and complaints about Russia, what Russia is

01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:19.760
doing, and this is not something we approve
of” the entire time.

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.540
Barack Obama has the reset.

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:26.050
He wanted to start a new relationship with
Russia, but he didn’t go out there and praise

01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:28.360
Putin in some fulsome way.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.850
That’s why people were confused.

01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:33.270
They didn’t understand why would somebody
running for a major political office in America

01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:37.850
choose to embrace somebody like Vladimir Putin,
and not only choose to embrace it, but see

01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:42.360
it as a political winner?

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:49.420
The American system is automatically set up
to reward politicians for being tough on Russia,

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:52.230
not for being soft on Russia.

01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:57.320
He was flying against every precept of normal
campaigning.

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:04.469
No matter how many times people tried to invite
him to offer more measured appraisal of Putin,

01:38:04.469 --> 01:38:05.469
he declined.

01:38:05.469 --> 01:38:06.750
He stepped away from it.

01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:09.640
That’s what caused people to wonder.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.920
People were scratching their heads.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.219
Maybe there's something behind this.

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:16.460
Maybe this is not just a guy having a judgment
about another leader, but there's something

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:17.469
we don’t understand.

01:38:17.469 --> 01:38:24.010
JIM GILMORE - … What's your take, overall,
about the collusion question?

01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:32.949
Is this a case of the willingness among the
campaign folks to play ball with the Russians?

01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:41.100
Is this more of the Russians using the Trump
folks as unwilling dupes, but willing to go

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.040
a certain distance down this road?

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:48.900
PETER BAKER - That’s the mystery, right,
is that the innocent explanation is that the

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:53.270
Trump people were naive and didn’t understand
what they were doing.

01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:57.900
They were being either duped by the Russians
or they just didn’t understand what was

01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:01.770
proper and what was normal or how it might
look to the American public.

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:06.670
Remember, of course, the president and the
people around him were not very experienced

01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:09.960
in national politics or international affairs.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:15.730
The explanation on the part of their defenders
today is: “Well, they were just doing what

01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:16.850
they thought was OK.

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:20.890
They didn’t realize that this might cause
the big stink that it later became.”

01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:26.120
The more nefarious explanation, of course,
is what Robert Mueller and the congressional

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.340
committees are looking at.

01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:28.350
Is there something there?

01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:30.949
Is there some sort of cooperation?

01:39:30.949 --> 01:39:35.100
Is there some sort of a clandestine alliance?

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.430
Are there financial ties?

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:41.030
Why would a president of the United States
or a person who wants to be president of the

01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:49.900
United States seem so wrapped up in working
tightly with an adversary, a country that

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:52.970
we have been sanctioning and isolating for
the last several years?

01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:56.420
JIM GILMORE - … [Real estate developer]
Felix Sater’s attempt to get the Trump Tower

01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:01.760
[in Moscow] job done, the fact that it is
now obvious that this was happening during

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:13.000
the campaign, that a letter of intent was
signed by Donald Trump while he was running

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.580
for the presidency, why is that story important?

01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:18.780
Why is it relevant?

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.780
What does it say?

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:24.170
PETER BAKER - The story about the effort to
put a Trump Tower in Moscow is important,

01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:28.350
in large part because President Trump has
done so much to try to say, “I have nothing

01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:30.930
to do with business in Russia.”

01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:36.210
His wording is sometimes careful, and it sometimes
allows for the idea that this might have happened.

01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:41.080
In other words, he hasn’t 100 percent ruled
out that he sought to do business there.

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.140
Every interview, every press conference, he
has addressed this, he has tried to give the

01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:46.790
idea that “I had nothing to do with Moscow.

01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:51.260
I had nothing to do with business in Russia,
and anybody who’s trying to suggest otherwise

01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:53.040
is politically motivated.”

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:59.140
Well, we now learn that, in fact, a person
representing him was dealing with the Russians,

01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:04.290
was at least trying to have a big business
project there, as he’s running for president

01:41:04.290 --> 01:41:06.980
of the United States, something he did not
disclose, something he did not say, “Yeah,

01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:08.620
I tried to do it, but it didn’t work out.”

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.620
That would be one thing.

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:10.620
He didn’t say that.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.620
He didn’t volunteer that.

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.989
When you learn about these things after the
fact, given all the smoke and given all the

01:41:15.989 --> 01:41:19.520
suspicion, it only adds to that concern.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.560
Why didn’t he tell us about it if in fact
it didn’t mean anything?

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.630
If in fact it’s not relevant, why was he
hiding it?

01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:32.140
JIM GILMORE - The June 9 meeting at Trump
Tower with [Jared] Kushner and Don[ald Trump]

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:36.239
Jr. [Paul] Manafort, what does that show?

01:41:36.239 --> 01:41:38.680
And with the Russians, what does that show?

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:44.280
Some people will look at it now and say there
was a willingness to accept the help.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:47.770
What is the definition of “collusion”
here?

01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:49.840
This one seemed pretty suspect.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.340
PETER BAKER - The emails are very clear.

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:55.780
There's nothing ambiguous about this.

01:41:55.780 --> 01:42:00.860
The emails say, “We would like to come in
to give you incriminating information about

01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:06.250
your opponent, provided by the Russian government,
which is supporting Mr. Trump’s campaign.”

01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:08.190
It’s there in black and white.

01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:10.270
That may not be what was discussed at the
meeting.

01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:11.270
We don’t know.

01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:12.270
They have denied it.

01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:13.680
But that was what was setup as the meeting.

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.170
That was the predicate for the meeting.

01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:19.830
That was the understanding that Donald Jr.
had when he accepted this meeting, which was

01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:25.210
that he was going to get, on behalf of his
father, information provided by the Russians,

01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:29.790
as part of a Russian government effort to
help Donald Trump become president.

01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:31.430
JIM GILMORE - So what's the problem?

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:32.430
Everybody does that.

01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:33.430
All campaigns do that.

01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:35.440
PETER BAKER - Well, they say everybody does
that, but, in fact, I can't think of anybody

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.440
who’s done that, not with an adversarial
foreign government.

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:43.350
It’s one thing to say, “OK, a Democrat
is going to walk into my office and tell me

01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:44.940
something negative about a Democrat.”

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:47.650
That’s an American-and-American thing.

01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:53.199
This is a foreign government that we are at
odds with, that we have sanctioned repeatedly

01:42:53.199 --> 01:43:00.580
in the last several years, purporting to come
in and offer information to tilt an election

01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:01.580
campaign.

01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:04.070
It’s not something everybody does, and it’s
not something that happens every day.

01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:05.070
…

01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:06.850
JIM GILMORE - And the fact that Manafort and
Kushner were in that meeting?

01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:10.320
PETER BAKER - The fact that Manafort and Kushner
are in that meeting means it’s not just

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.320
the son.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:16.120
Manafort is the campaign chairman; Kushner
is a de facto campaign manager.

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.580
They may not have thought the meeting was
worth very much.

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.080
We don’t know for a fact that they read
to the end of the emails.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:26.840
But it’s pretty extraordinary to take a
meeting at that level, at the very moment

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.650
that their candidate is wrapping up the Republican
nomination and preparing for a general election

01:43:31.650 --> 01:43:35.980
campaign, to take any meeting with a stranger
without knowing what it was about, without

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.060
having some sense of what you're going to
get from it.

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:42.370
Jared Kushner may be new at politics, and
Donald Trump Jr. may be new at politics.

01:43:42.370 --> 01:43:43.930
Paul Manafort is not new at politics.

01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:45.540
He’s been doing this for 40 years.

01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:50.140
He understands both American politics and
what the Russians and the Ukrainians were

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.640
up to.

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:59.690
For him to take a meeting with a Russian with
this understanding can't be marked up to naivete.

01:43:59.690 --> 01:44:02.530
That’s somebody who’s been involved in
politics at a high level since the ’70s.

01:44:02.530 --> 01:44:04.630
JIM GILMORE - But Trump says he knew nothing
of it.

01:44:04.630 --> 01:44:08.620
PETER BAKER - Trump says he knew nothing about
it.

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:10.580
But what's interesting is I asked him about
this during an interview.

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:15.300
We did an interview with Trump in July of
this year, after the emails came out.

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.070
I asked him about this three times.

01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:21.771
I said, “This email says that the meeting
was set up as part of an effort by the Russian

01:44:21.771 --> 01:44:23.090
government to help you.”

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.900
“Well, I didn’t know about the meeting,”
he says.”

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:28.050
“OK, you didn’t know about it then.

01:44:28.050 --> 01:44:29.050
You know about it now.

01:44:29.050 --> 01:44:30.050
You’ve read that email now.

01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:31.080
What does that say to you?

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.890
What does that tell you about what Russia
was up to?

01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:35.210
Does that cause you any concern?”

01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:38.950
“Well, I didn’t need any negative information
from the Russians,” he said.

01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:41.960
His answer was basically: “I already had
more than enough negative information about

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.250
Hillary Clinton.

01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:46.790
They couldn’t tell me anything that I wasn’t
saying about her already.

01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:49.679
Maybe if they had told me that she had shot
somebody in the back, that would have helped

01:44:49.679 --> 01:44:50.679
me.

01:44:50.679 --> 01:44:53.400
But otherwise I didn’t need their help,”
which of course doesn’t really answer the

01:44:53.400 --> 01:45:00.010
question, which is, “Does it disturb you
that the Russians were avowedly trying to

01:45:00.010 --> 01:45:04.350
help your campaign, and that your campaign
would take a meeting with somebody advertising

01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:05.350
that as its purpose?”

01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:06.350
He didn’t answer that.

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:12.800
JIM GILMORE - What does it say about him that
that doesn’t seem to matter?

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:19.449
PETER BAKER - For him, all of these questions
about Russia are an attack on his legitimacy.

01:45:19.449 --> 01:45:23.440
If we ask questions about what Russia was
up to during last year’s election, it’s

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:29.280
a way of saying, in his mind, that he shouldn’t
have won—didn’t win outright, and it’s

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.160
questioning his legitimacy as president.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:36.340
You can ask questions about the Russia interference
in last year’s election without presuming

01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:38.750
that it would actually change the outcome
or that it has anything to do with whether

01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:43.219
Donald Trump should have been or was correctly
elected president.

01:45:43.219 --> 01:45:47.590
You could be concerned about Russia interference
and our democracy simply because that’s

01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:51.760
something by itself, regardless of the outcome,
that should concern us.

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:56.070
That’s what we hear a lot from many Republicans
as well as Democrats.

01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:57.570
But for Trump, it’s an attack.

01:45:57.570 --> 01:46:00.200
It’s an attack on his legitimacy.

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:09.010
He doesn’t entertain questions about it
because he sees it as trumped-up, if you will,

01:46:09.010 --> 01:46:11.720
Democratic whining about an election they
shouldn’t have lost.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.270
JIM GILMORE - Another event, the Dec. 1, 2016,
meeting.

01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:19.710
Kushner, Flynn meet with Kislyak at Trump
Tower.

01:46:19.710 --> 01:46:26.800
There's discussion about working with them
on foreign affairs and Syria and such and

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.489
a Russian back channel.

01:46:28.489 --> 01:46:35.320
They want to set up a back-channel way to
discuss with the Russians these foreign affair

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:44.610
issues while they're in transition, without
the NSA, without the Americans listening in.

01:46:44.610 --> 01:46:46.280
Why is this a disturbing story?

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280
What does it say?

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.280
What does it mean?

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.280
Why did it get them in trouble?

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.280
Why didn’t they understand?

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:59.230
PETER BAKER - It’s not especially surprising
that a new team coming in would talk to foreign

01:46:59.230 --> 01:47:00.230
ambassadors.

01:47:00.230 --> 01:47:02.230
That’s what ambassadors do.

01:47:02.230 --> 01:47:07.220
What's surprising about it is this idea of
a back channel.

01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:08.510
Back channels are not new.

01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:12.370
But this idea that we’re having a back channel
that we are trying to specifically set up

01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:19.100
to avoid American agencies knowing what we’re
doing, that’s what sounded off alarm bells

01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:21.900
for many people in Washington.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:25.550
What Jared Kushner was talking about doing
was actually coming to the Russian Embassy

01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:29.580
and using their equipment to talk to Moscow.

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:32.930
That’s pretty unheard of.

01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:39.120
A back channel is not unheard of, but using
the Russian equipment to avoid detection by

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:45.130
American agencies speaks to, at the very least,
their own sense of suspicion and paranoia,

01:47:45.130 --> 01:47:51.710
perhaps, about being monitored, about being
under surveillance, and suggests, of course,

01:47:51.710 --> 01:47:55.510
that there are things that they want to talk
about that they don’t want anybody else

01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:57.020
to talk about.

01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:03.640
Diplomacy is full of secrets and full of clandestine
conversations.

01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:08.250
But these guys are not yet president of the
United States; they're not yet in office.

01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:10.320
Usually these things wait until you get into
office.

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:19.140
Usually there is a process under which this
happens that does not seem intended to shut

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:23.060
out agencies of the American government.

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.060
…

01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:28.700
JIM GILMORE - The signals being sent to Putin
and the Kremlin by all these things—

01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:30.530
PETER BAKER - Well—

01:48:30.530 --> 01:48:38.030
JIM GILMORE - —and how it can be used in
their benefit, or how the Americans can possibly

01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:39.770
be more easily manipulated?

01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:43.770
I mean, how do you think the Russians or how
do you think Putin is viewing this?

01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:47.150
PETER BAKER - I think Putin is looking at
a new group of people coming in who aren’t

01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:54.679
very experienced, who aren’t very seasoned,
who he might be able to take advantage of.

01:48:54.679 --> 01:49:00.489
Putin is a master manipulator, and he’s
a master at trying to take advantage of opportunities

01:49:00.489 --> 01:49:01.489
in front of him.

01:49:01.489 --> 01:49:06.390
Here he finds a group of people who haven't
been on the world stage before and who seem

01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:12.330
willing to play ball as he defines the rules.

01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:13.440
This looks like a win for him.

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:14.989
This looks like a bonanza for him.

01:49:14.989 --> 01:49:17.830
Maybe he can get out from under these sanctions.

01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:22.580
Maybe he can split Europe and the United States
away from each other, drive a wedge among

01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:32.590
the Western allies and get out from under
this quasi-blockade, in effect, that the Western

01:49:32.590 --> 01:49:33.590
world has set up.

01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:38.650
JIM GILMORE - The last one of the collusion
questions is, Kushner later meets with [Sergey]

01:49:38.650 --> 01:49:45.280
Gorkov, the head of the Russian bank, and
they talk about, supposedly, U.S. sanctions.

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.639
… What's your take on that meeting?

01:49:48.639 --> 01:49:49.710
Why is it relevant?

01:49:49.710 --> 01:49:50.710
Or isn't it relevant?

01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:56.010
What does it say again about the way this
White House or to-be White House is doing

01:49:56.010 --> 01:49:57.010
business?

01:49:57.010 --> 01:50:00.920
PETER BAKER - I think meeting with this banker
is so much more interesting and important

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.450
than meeting with the ambassador.

01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:06.750
The ambassador is paid to meet with American
officials, even people who are on the way

01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:07.760
in.

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.910
But the banker like this is under sanctions.

01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:14.159
It’s illegal for Americans to do business
with this bank, somebody [who] is designated

01:50:14.159 --> 01:50:20.280
by the Treasury Department as an agent of
the Russian government and subject to penalty

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:24.110
under law for doing business with.

01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:32.199
To then have a meeting with somebody like
this, with no obvious purpose, raises a lot

01:50:32.199 --> 01:50:33.500
of red flags.

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.500
What was that about?

01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:35.520
Why was this happening?

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.670
What's going on here?

01:50:37.670 --> 01:50:45.710
At the very least, it seems unusual and raises
questions.

01:50:45.710 --> 01:50:54.780
At the worst, it suggests some sort of deal
making about sanctions after they take office.

01:50:54.780 --> 01:51:00.650
In fact, when President Trump takes office,
there is an initial flurry about whether to

01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:04.699
go ahead and lift some of these sanctions
that President Obama had imposed on Russia.

01:51:04.699 --> 01:51:10.370
In fact, there is talk day in and day out
in the first few days that they're going to

01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:11.820
happen any day now.

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:15.870
It’s basically stopped by Congress, which
says, “Whoa, wait a second.”

01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:21.290
Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader
of the Senate, says, “If they lift sanctions,

01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:27.070
I'm going to let a bill go to the floor that
will impose sanctions legislatively over the

01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:28.500
president’s objections.”

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.909
That stops the White House, at least temporarily.

01:51:30.909 --> 01:51:37.891
JIM GILMORE - What's the attitude of the Russians
toward the fact that when Trump wins, they

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:42.090
basically have this guy who’s basically
talking about them wanting to get rid of sanctions?

01:51:42.090 --> 01:51:43.260
… Number one, what is that view?

01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:47.400
And number two is, how does that segue, when
they start understanding that here is a president

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:55.260
who is basically handcuffed because of the
blowback from all these stories hitting, the

01:51:55.260 --> 01:52:00.500
reality of what Russia did during the election,
and that Congress is very paranoid that this

01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:06.120
president might in fact give away the house
here, and in fact comes down so hard on the

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:07.120
sanctions?

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.820
PETER BAKER - You could argue that Putin overplayed
his hand here.

01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:14.850
If the goal was to get an American administration
that was friendlier to the Kremlin, that was

01:52:14.850 --> 01:52:19.350
willing to work with Russia on issues around
the world, or let up the pressure on Ukraine

01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:24.790
to take off the sanctions, then it’s been
a complete and abject failure, because the

01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:25.790
exact opposite has happened.

01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:30.620
The political environment in Washington is
so toxic right now toward Russia, is so poisoned

01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:34.960
by this investigation, that even Trump himself,
President Trump himself, said, “I'm not

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.219
going to be able to get anything done with
Russia because everybody will see it as a

01:52:38.219 --> 01:52:42.590
political payout of some sort.”

01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:47.449
It had the opposite effect of what Putin presumably
wanted.

01:52:47.449 --> 01:52:53.020
Not only are sanctions not being lifted, they’ve
now been put into law by Congress, over the

01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:55.900
objection of the president of the United States,
with veto-proof majorities.

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:58.980
Those sanctions aren’t coming off any time
soon now.

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:06.530
It’s almost impossible for this president
to strike up a friendlier relationship, even

01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:10.950
if it makes sense on policy level, because
it will be seen in the context of this investigation.

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:13.640
Now you have this tit-for-tat retaliation.

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:20.490
The Russians ordered the United States to
get rid of 750 members of the staff in Russia;

01:53:20.490 --> 01:53:25.280
the United States responded by ordering the
closure of the consulate in San Francisco

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.090
and a commensurate reduction of staff here.

01:53:28.090 --> 01:53:31.699
It’s now become even worse than it was before
the election.

01:53:31.699 --> 01:53:36.300
JIM GILMORE - So the stance toward Russia
now by this Trump administration is what?

01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:41.400
PETER BAKER - … It’s still a very confused
policy, because the administration took what

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:47.790
other administrations might have done in terms
of responding to the Russian diplomatic expulsion

01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:48.890
by saying: “Fine.

01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:50.969
We will meet your action with our action.

01:53:50.969 --> 01:53:54.420
We closed the consulate in San Francisco;
we closed three other diplomatic annexes.”

01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:56.159
But you didn’t hear President Trump talk
about that.

01:53:56.159 --> 01:54:01.690
President Trump didn’t come out and say,
“The Russians have done us wrong by taking

01:54:01.690 --> 01:54:05.050
these actions, and I'm going to respond in
kind.”

01:54:05.050 --> 01:54:09.550
Instead, the only time he’s commented on
this was, he was asked during his vacation

01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:13.340
in Bedminster, N.J., about the Russian expulsions.

01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:17.190
He said: “I'm glad they did it, because
then we don’t have to have as many staff

01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:18.190
there.

01:54:18.190 --> 01:54:19.380
We’re cutting our payroll and saving us
money.”

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.900
He can't bring himself to say a single critical
word about President Putin.

01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:26.880
Again, this is what raises alarms and questions.

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:30.950
Why is it that he can't simply say what every
other American politician would say, which

01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:34.750
is that this is a provocative act by the Russians
and we don’t approve of it?

01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:35.750
…

01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:38.710
JIM GILMORE - Let’s finish up a couple things
on the Obama White House.

01:54:38.710 --> 01:54:45.310
Obama goes to Putin, who again rejects any
involvement in the election whatsoever.

01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:49.140
And again—so he’s met with these denials.

01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:51.170
How does that affect him?

01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:55.360
… And the bigger question is, why does it
seem that the White House, the Obama White

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.240
House, was so reluctant to make a move before
the election?

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:04.320
Even after the election, it took two months
before these toothless sanctions came out

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.800
on Dec. 29.

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:11.880
PETER BAKER - I think leading up to the election,
there's a big debate inside the Obama administration:

01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:13.330
What kind of actions should they take?

01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:16.570
How public should they be about raising the
alarm?

01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:22.790
At least through a series of sort of half
measures and half reactions.

01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:29.050
There was a statement put out on Oct. 7 by
the leaders of the Intelligence Community

01:55:29.050 --> 01:55:30.960
saying, “We think the Russians are trying
to interfere.”

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:37.440
It gets not buried, but it gets overwhelmed
by the news later in the day of the Access

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.719
Hollywood tape coming out about President
Trump, or then-candidate Trump and his approach

01:55:42.719 --> 01:55:45.410
to women.

01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:47.960
Inside the administration there are people
who want to be more aggressive, who want to

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:50.690
be more outspoken about what Russia is doing.

01:55:50.690 --> 01:55:54.159
Then there's the essential caution of President
Obama.

01:55:54.159 --> 01:55:56.900
A couple of reasons.

01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:59.150
One, his candidate is winning.

01:55:59.150 --> 01:56:01.960
Hillary Clinton is ahead in the polls.

01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:04.000
Why do something to mess up that?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.630
The fear is that, if they go out there and
say, “The Russians are trying to tilt the

01:56:07.630 --> 01:56:11.900
election,” that Donald Trump, as a candidate,
would say, “Aha, they're trying to rig the

01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:15.070
election for Hillary Clinton,” because remember,
he’s already started to talk about this

01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:19.120
idea that the election might be rigged, so
the Obama people don’t want to play into

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:20.120
that argument.

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:27.340
The other thing is, they're worried, at this
point, about Russian hacking of election equipment.

01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:34.500
They're worried about the 50 states having
their voter machines screwed around with.

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.630
They're focused on working with the states
to make sure that doesn’t happen.

01:56:37.630 --> 01:56:40.870
The other thing is, they can't get any buy-in
from congressional Republicans.

01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:41.870
They go to Mitch McConnell.

01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:46.090
They go to the Hill, and they say, “Let’s
come out together with a statement of concern.”

01:56:46.090 --> 01:56:50.139
The Republicans don’t want anything to do
with this.

01:56:50.139 --> 01:56:53.489
Obama backs off rather than actually saying,
“Fine, we’ll do it ourselves.”

01:56:53.489 --> 01:56:56.980
There are a lot of people around President
Obama who think that was a mistake, who think

01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:05.500
that they should have been more assertive
and that they lost an opportunity to alert

01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.040
the country to what was happening.

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.250
JIM GILMORE - There are suppositions and more
and more news coming out about the election

01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:14.620
hacking into the states and that it seems
to be more important than maybe the press

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:15.620
understood.

01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:24.050
In China, when Obama talks to Putin, the thing
that he’s focused on is hacking into the

01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:27.750
electoral process, the actual vote tallies
and such.

01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:28.750
…

01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:31.780
PETER BAKER - We don’t have any evidence
that I'm aware of publicly right now that

01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:38.380
they succeeded at invading these state computers
with any impact, but that was clearly a big

01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:39.900
concern at the time.

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:43.290
The Obama administration was trying to work
with the 50 states on that.

01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:45.780
What they got was some pushback.

01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:50.810
The states are very protective of their own
sovereignty, of their own control over election

01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:51.810
equipment.

01:57:51.810 --> 01:57:56.400
They didn’t want the Feds coming in and
telling them what to do and seeming to take

01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.400
control.

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:00.120
Remember, again, Donald Trump was talking
about a rigged election.

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.409
That would play into that.

01:58:01.409 --> 01:58:05.810
So it was a sensitive issue, a politically
dynamic issue, but one that was a big, big

01:58:05.810 --> 01:58:12.561
concern at the time, and maybe something that
will continue to turn up new information that

01:58:12.561 --> 01:58:14.340
we don’t know about.

01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:21.720
Obviously, hacking emails can have an impact,
but a much bigger, much bigger worry is if

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:28.889
they can actually mess around with voter registration
rolls and change the very basis on which we

01:58:28.889 --> 01:58:30.250
have our elections.

01:58:30.250 --> 01:58:37.969
JIM GILMORE - One last thing on this and then
we’ll move forward into the end stuff.

01:58:37.969 --> 01:58:46.840
The eventual sanctions in Hawaii: The president
comes out, and he defines the sanctions that

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.130
are being brought.

01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:51.460
A lot of people look back at this point and
sort of say, basically, pretty toothless.

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:52.460
…

01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:53.460
PETER BAKER - President Obama is on the way
out.

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:55.180
He’s only got a few weeks left in office.

01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:59.850
He knows that anything he does can be reversed
the second he’s gone.

01:58:59.850 --> 01:59:02.969
He’s trying to find what he thinks is the
right response.

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:07.690
One is to say, “Look, we know what you did,
and we’re not going to sit by without taking

01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:08.870
action about it.”

01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:18.130
The flipside is, if he goes too far, in the
view of some, he might then provoke a reaction

01:59:18.130 --> 01:59:19.550
by President-elect Trump.

01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:27.830
So he chooses a moderate, measured response
in closing these two diplomatic facilities

01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:29.469
and kicking out 35 diplomats.

01:59:29.469 --> 01:59:30.620
It’s meant to send a message.

01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:33.900
It’s not meant to hurt Russia; it’s meant
to send a message: “We know what you did.

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.980
We’re not going to put up with it.”

01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:43.120
What he hopes is that President-elect Trump
will stand by that and agree to it.

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:47.130
In fact, Vladimir Putin doesn’t retaliate,
because he assumed President-elect Trump is

01:59:47.130 --> 01:59:48.770
going to reverse it the next day.

01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:54.900
So [Obama] actually doesn’t get the support
from his successor that he had hoped for,

01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:59.940
and he isn't leaving office without having
really done something significant about this,

01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:03.020
to the regret and the chagrin of many of the
people around him.

02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:04.940
JIM GILMORE - A missed opportunity.

02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:10.270
PETER BAKER - A missed opportunity, and the
last opportunity, they felt, to really stand

02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:12.050
up to the Russians and say: “We caught you.

02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:13.050
Don’t do this.

02:00:13.050 --> 02:00:16.250
You can't do this without facing a punishment
of some sort.”

02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:19.780
The punishment wasn’t, in the view of some,
commensurate to the crime.

02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:23.969
JIM GILMORE - … The DNI report comes out
on Jan. 6 or Jan. 5.

02:00:23.969 --> 02:00:28.890
On Jan. 6, the intelligence leaders [John]
Brennan and [James] Comey and [James] Clapper

02:00:28.890 --> 02:00:30.890
go to Trump Tower.

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:38.510
They brief the incoming president about what
goes on.

02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:46.760
He then has a press conference a few days
later, where he reluctantly admits that the

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:53.429
Russians were possibly, probably involved,
but then backtracks on that in later days,

02:00:53.429 --> 02:00:54.630
in many situations.

02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:55.630
…

02:00:55.630 --> 02:00:58.600
PETER BAKER - Up until this point, President
Trump, or President-elect Trump, has been

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:00.340
saying, “We don’t know if the Russians
did it.”

02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.580
He’s been throwing doubt on the intelligence.

02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:04.280
He’s been deflecting attention.

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.630
Maybe it was a 400-pound guy in a basement
or the Chinese or who knows?

02:01:08.630 --> 02:01:10.070
Intelligence guys come in.

02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:11.290
The agency directors come in.

02:01:11.290 --> 02:01:12.530
They present their evidence to him.

02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:16.840
They say, “This is why we think, unanimously,
that the Russians did this.”

02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:20.070
There is no dissent about this within the
Intelligence Community.

02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:23.860
Not every intelligence agency looked at it,
but those who looked at it all agree, this

02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.989
is an open-and-shut case.

02:01:26.989 --> 02:01:32.010
At that point, the president-elect can't come
out and then directly refute the people who

02:01:32.010 --> 02:01:35.921
have just told him this, so he says, grudgingly:
“It looks like Russia did it.

02:01:35.921 --> 02:01:37.550
I accept that that’s what happened.”

02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:38.780
But he doesn’t stick to it.

02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:44.620
It’s just not a conclusion that will actually
shape his thinking, because pretty soon afterward,

02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.250
he gets back to his: “Well, they probably
did it.

02:01:47.250 --> 02:01:48.270
Maybe they didn’t do it.

02:01:48.270 --> 02:01:49.270
Somebody else could have done it.

02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:52.390
Remember, these are the guys who got the Iraq
intelligence wrong on the weapons of mass

02:01:52.390 --> 02:02:01.679
destruction,” etc., casting doubt, clouding
the issue, and never fully accepting what

02:02:01.679 --> 02:02:03.239
is the conclusion of the intelligence agency.

02:02:03.239 --> 02:02:07.810
By not accepting that conclusion, he doesn’t
accept the need to do something about it.

02:02:07.810 --> 02:02:12.670
If we don’t really know for a fact that
Russia did it, then he doesn’t have to respond.

02:02:12.670 --> 02:02:18.550
That leads to a policy in which Russia doesn’t
pay another price by this president for what

02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:19.550
it did last year.

02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:22.310
JIM GILMORE - … The Russian story will not
go away.

02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:24.670
It frustrates Trump tremendously.

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:31.010
Talk a little bit about the fact that it would
never go away, how it affected Trump, and

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:35.020
how it affected his agenda, how important
it has been.

02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:38.520
PETER BAKER - This is a story that won't go
away.

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.750
It eats away at Trump.

02:02:40.750 --> 02:02:45.770
He watches TV; he sees it in the paper; he
hears people talk about it; and it just gnaws

02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:46.770
at him.

02:02:46.770 --> 02:02:50.949
He’ll bring it up himself in circumstances
where he doesn’t have to, because it sticks

02:02:50.949 --> 02:02:51.949
in his craw.

02:02:51.949 --> 02:02:56.260
It is an attack on his legitimacy, as he sees
it.

02:02:56.260 --> 02:03:00.550
It is an excuse by Democrats for the fact
that they lost.

02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:05.460
And everything in his mind is an attack on
him.

02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:06.679
So he attacks back.

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:07.679
That’s his nature.

02:03:07.679 --> 02:03:09.639
If he feels attacked, he attacks back.

02:03:09.639 --> 02:03:15.920
Of course he then, in some ways, makes it
worse by a, keeping the issue in front of

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:24.219
the public and on days it might not have ever
been discussed; and b, escalating it and alienating

02:03:24.219 --> 02:03:28.219
people who are actually investigating what's
going on.

02:03:28.219 --> 02:03:33.650
Cardinal rule of thumb in Washington: If you're
under investigation, you don’t tick off

02:03:33.650 --> 02:03:35.040
the people who are investigating you.

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:40.690
You don’t question their motives unless
you're planning to go on all-out war, like

02:03:40.690 --> 02:03:44.580
the Clintons did during the impeachment.

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:46.520
President Trump, it just consumes him.

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.090
This is something he just can't stop talking
about, stop thinking about.

02:03:50.090 --> 02:03:52.450
Every morning he brings it up; he talks about
it with aides.

02:03:52.450 --> 02:03:58.989
He brings it up in interviews, even when he’s
not asked about it at times.

02:03:58.989 --> 02:04:01.000
It feels manifestly unfair to him.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:09.020
It feels like a concerted effort by the people
of Washington to reject his presidency, to

02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:11.610
hobble him from day one.

02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:14.699
He’s bristling and responding in kind.

02:04:14.699 --> 02:04:16.800
JIM GILMORE - And how does it lead to Comey’s
firing?

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:17.800
…

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.800
PETER BAKER - … This is the thing.

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:21.969
His frustration makes the situation worse
for him.

02:04:21.969 --> 02:04:25.440
He thinks James Comey, the FBI director, should
have his back.

02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.800
He thinks Jeff Sessions, the attorney general,
should have his back.

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:34.550
When they don’t, when they act in correspondence
to their view of the duties of their jobs,

02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:35.830
he lashes out.

02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:40.250
He says: “Jim Comey should have told the
public that I the president am not under investigation.

02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:41.250
Why won't he do that?

02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:43.080
He must not be doing that because he’s against
me.

02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:44.080
He’s out of here.

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:45.080
I'm firing him.”

02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.460
Well, that only adds to his trouble, because
now suddenly there's this question of whether

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:51.260
that act by itself constitutes obstruction
of justice.

02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:55.540
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t, but that
issue didn’t even exist before he fired

02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:56.540
James Comey.

02:04:56.540 --> 02:04:57.540
Now it does.

02:04:57.540 --> 02:04:58.540
…

02:04:58.540 --> 02:04:59.540
He does the same thing with Jeff Sessions.

02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:04.639
He comes out publicly and says, “Jeff Sessions
should not have recused himself from managing

02:05:04.639 --> 02:05:10.139
this investigation,” meaning he wanted his
attorney general to protect him from this

02:05:10.139 --> 02:05:11.139
investigation.

02:05:11.139 --> 02:05:15.409
Jeff Sessions, understanding that he had a
conflict of interest, had recused himself

02:05:15.409 --> 02:05:17.420
and said: “I can't be the person to monitor
this.

02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:18.550
It’s not politically correct.

02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:23.000
I should have somebody who’s not part of
President Trump’s political circle manage

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000
this.”

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.110
That’s the way things work in Washington.

02:05:25.110 --> 02:05:27.490
That’s not the way President Trump sees
things working.

02:05:27.490 --> 02:05:31.330
By attacking Jeff Sessions, he then alienates
the Senate Republicans, who are his [Sessions’]

02:05:31.330 --> 02:05:32.580
old colleagues.

02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:37.091
They stand up to him and say, “No, you cannot
fire the attorney general, because if you

02:05:37.091 --> 02:05:39.780
fire him, we’re not going to confirm a successor.”

02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:42.050
They basically put an end to that.

02:05:42.050 --> 02:05:47.429
But his frustration is mounting, and it’s
adding to his problems rather than making

02:05:47.429 --> 02:05:48.429
them go away.

02:05:48.429 --> 02:05:53.080
JIM GILMORE - And take us to the day after,
May 10.

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.820
He fires Comey.

02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:55.920
The meeting at the White House.

02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.389
Take us to that moment.

02:05:57.389 --> 02:06:00.780
PETER BAKER - … You couldn’t script this
to be any stranger.

02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:05.050
The day after he fires the FBI director, who’s
leading an investigation into Russian meddling

02:06:05.050 --> 02:06:07.179
in the election, who does the president meet
with?

02:06:07.179 --> 02:06:11.219
He meets with the Russian ambassador, who’s
been part of this investigation in the first

02:06:11.219 --> 02:06:15.699
place, and the foreign minister.

02:06:15.699 --> 02:06:19.679
We know, now, from reporting by our paper
and others, that they talked about this.

02:06:19.679 --> 02:06:22.810
They talked about firing the FBI director.

02:06:22.810 --> 02:06:28.010
President Trump told the Russians that firing
James Comey would take some of the pressure

02:06:28.010 --> 02:06:32.139
off and make it easier for them to have a
relationship.

02:06:32.139 --> 02:06:37.739
As if that weren’t strange enough, the same
day he ends up meeting with Henry Kissinger

02:06:37.739 --> 02:06:44.330
in his office, which just seems to reinforce
the whole Nixon comparisons that are already

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:47.780
happening, because he’s now fired the FBI
director.

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:52.750
As a matter of optics, if nothing else, it
only feeds the fury; it feeds the fire; it

02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:56.580
feeds the suspicions.

02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:58.980
Rather than making his problems go away, he
compounds them.

02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:03.150
JIM GILMORE - And a misunderstanding by the
president that, in fact, that this would take

02:07:03.150 --> 02:07:04.150
the pressure off.

02:07:04.150 --> 02:07:06.980
PETER BAKER - It’s hard to know whether
he really believed this, but he said he thought

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:11.210
Democrats would be happy that he had fired
James Comey because they were so mad at the

02:07:11.210 --> 02:07:15.880
FBI director for his handling of the investigation
into Hillary Clinton’s emails from the previous

02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:16.880
year.

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:17.880
It’s true.

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:18.880
The Democrats did not like James Comey.

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.310
They thought he mishandled that investigation.

02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:23.580
They didn’t like the way he had performed
the year before.

02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:26.441
But that didn’t mean that they were willing
to have the President of the United States

02:07:26.441 --> 02:07:30.890
fire him at the same time he was leading an
investigation into the Russian interference,

02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:37.090
and then openly admit that the Russian investigation
was on his mind when he decided to fire him.

02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:40.870
JIM GILMORE - That moment when [Foreign Minister
Sergey] Lavrov was walking into the meeting

02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:45.489
and the press asked him about the firing was
odd.

02:07:45.489 --> 02:07:47.750
[What's] your perspective on that?

02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:50.300
PETER BAKER - Lavrov is a quirky fellow.

02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:54.060
He plays with the reporters: “Oh, I didn’t
know that…”

02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:56.640
It’s—he’s teasing.

02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:58.300
You know, he’s having fun.

02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:02.719
He’s at the same time stoking the fire a
little bit.

02:08:02.719 --> 02:08:10.449
It’s not to Trump’s benefit, but they're
enjoying the discomfort in the American system.

02:08:10.449 --> 02:08:16.020
They're enjoying the fact that the Americans
are at each other’s throat over this issue,

02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:19.020
and he’s having fun with it.

02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:20.020
…

02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:25.310
JIM GILMORE - … In the end, what does Putin
get out of all this?

02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:30.070
PETER BAKER - If you think that Putin had
two goals here, he succeeded in one and failed

02:08:30.070 --> 02:08:31.070
in the other.

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:36.429
The first is to create dissension, to create
doubt, to disrupt the American democratic

02:08:36.429 --> 02:08:43.880
system, to make people wonder whether it really
worked to have people at each other’s throats.

02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:45.429
In that he succeeded.

02:08:45.429 --> 02:08:53.550
But if the second goal was to put an administration
in power in Washington that would lift the

02:08:53.550 --> 02:09:00.360
sanctions, that would stand by Russia rather
than against Russia, that would ease the pressure

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:05.389
that they had been feeling economically, internationally,
diplomatically, then they failed; then Putin

02:09:05.389 --> 02:09:07.429
failed, because, in fact, it’s had the opposite
effect.

02:09:07.429 --> 02:09:11.219
It’s now toxic in Washington.

02:09:11.219 --> 02:09:17.310
It’s impossible for any political figure
in Washington to genuinely change the relationship

02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:20.340
with Russia for the better at the moment,
because it would be seen in the context of

02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:21.429
this investigation.

02:09:21.429 --> 02:09:24.320
On the one hand, disruption, yes.

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.330
On the other hand, a new relationship, no.

02:09:27.330 --> 02:09:33.790
JIM GILMORE - … How has it increased his
power and his ability to control things back

02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:34.790
in Russia?

02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:36.980
PETER BAKER - It’s put Russia back on the
world stage.

02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:39.210
It’s made Russia a player.

02:09:39.210 --> 02:09:40.420
You cannot ignore Russia.

02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:42.320
That’s the thing that Putin hates the most.

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:45.160
You can't just disregard what Russia thinks.

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.300
Well, what are we doing here?

02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:47.300
We’re talking about Russia.

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:49.340
We’re talking about Russia a lot.

02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:50.889
That to him is a win.

02:09:50.889 --> 02:09:56.989
It also allows him domestically to point to
outside enemies.

02:09:56.989 --> 02:10:01.139
If the economy isn't doing well, it’s not
because President Putin has done something

02:10:01.139 --> 02:10:04.110
wrong policy-wise; it’s because: “the
rest of the world is out to get us.

02:10:04.110 --> 02:10:10.860
The rest of the world is lined up against
us in an anti-Russian alliance.

02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:12.969
We have to stand together as Russians.”

02:10:12.969 --> 02:10:18.219
That, heading into the next election for President
Putin, is a pretty important dynamic.

02:10:18.219 --> 02:10:21.219
Now, he’s not likely to lose any election
under any circumstance.

02:10:21.219 --> 02:10:24.970
But he really does want to have the support
of the Russian people.

02:10:24.970 --> 02:10:28.520
Ginning up anti-American fervor, anti-Western
fervor, is part of that.

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:31.530
JIM GILMORE - He fears those folks out on
the street.

02:10:31.530 --> 02:10:36.250
I mean, elections might not matter, but those
people in the streets could bring him down

02:10:36.250 --> 02:10:38.920
as they brought down dictator—tyrant after
tyrant.

02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:42.190
PETER BAKER - He hates people in the streets,
absolutely.

02:10:42.190 --> 02:10:48.070
He looks around him, and he sees these color
revolutions in Ukraine, in Georgia, in Kyrgyzstan,

02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:49.250
in Serbia.

02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:54.840
He sees elections in which longtime entrenched
leaders were taken down by popular demonstrations,

02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:58.010
fomented in his view, by the Americans.

02:10:58.010 --> 02:11:03.520
He does not look at the Russian intervention
in last year’s election as an opening gun.

02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.570
He looks at it as a retaliation for what we,
the Americans, have done in his backyard,

02:11:07.570 --> 02:11:10.389
and even in Moscow, in his view, over the
years.

02:11:10.389 --> 02:11:12.750
We interfered in his country; he’ll interfere
in ours.

02:11:12.750 --> 02:11:14.410
That’s the way he sees these things.

02:11:14.410 --> 02:11:22.221
So for him, this battle with the West, this
battle with the United States is part and

02:11:22.221 --> 02:11:24.590
parcel of his appeal to his own public.

02:11:24.590 --> 02:11:27.040
JIM GILMORE - All politics is domestic politics.

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.179
PETER BAKER - All politics is domestic politics,
yeah.

02:11:29.179 --> 02:11:34.810
JIM GILMORE - And in a way, for him, how important
is that aspect of all this?

02:11:34.810 --> 02:11:38.280
PETER BAKER - It’s important to remember,
always, that, while he’s not a democratic

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:44.070
leader in the traditional sense, he does want
to keep control of a country where anything

02:11:44.070 --> 02:11:45.550
can happen.

02:11:45.550 --> 02:11:48.409
When he took over, Russia felt like it was
falling apart.

02:11:48.409 --> 02:11:55.770
To him, it felt like there was chaos; there
was lack of order.

02:11:55.770 --> 02:12:01.790
What he has spent these last 17 years trying
to do is re-establish order, re-establish

02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:08.150
control, re-establish a system that marches
to his tune.

02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:12.260
And last thing he wants to see is that fall
apart.

02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:13.960
JIM GILMORE - Great.

02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:15.659
And we’re heading—

02:12:15.659 --> 02:12:22.500
PETER BAKER - I mean, the risk for any Russian
leader—you have very few examples in Russia’s

02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:27.580
history of leaders who leave office voluntarily
and have a good life afterward.

02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:31.050
So he has to think about the rest of his life.

02:12:31.050 --> 02:12:34.429
The people around him are worried about what
they have.

02:12:34.429 --> 02:12:39.430
If for some reason they were ever to lose
power, the threat, the damage, the danger

02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:42.770
to them is very tangible, very real.

02:12:42.770 --> 02:12:48.909
Keeping control in Russia is imperative.
