00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.540
On October 24, 1929, the American stock market
crashed.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.990
The New York Stock exchange is in a panic!

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.700
Frantic investors have scrambled to unload
their stocks

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.480
Fortunes disappeared overnight, and the value
of American companies tanked.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.320
But the people in charge of those companies
had an idea.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.920
They started buying shares of their own company's stock from investors.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.130
Which meant there were fewer stocks out there
for other people to buy.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.140
And when there’s less of something, the
price goes up.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.960
Normally, to raise their stock prices, these companies would have had

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.690
to do something to get investors excited:

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.040
invent a new product, or a different way of doing things.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.489
But with this, corporations had discovered a kind of magic trick.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.820
They could jack up their stock price without
really doing anything.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.440
This is a stock buyback.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.079
An attempt by the owners of America’s biggest
corporations to hang on to their wealth

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.420
while the rest of the country suffered the
worst Depression ever.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.380
This practice helped fundamentally reshape the American economy,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.960
and it set the stage for a century long fight

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.251
we’re still having.

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:16.251
It was a choice.

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:17.450
And it was about greed.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.040
Someone has forgotten about the human element.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.869
A fight about where American wealth comes from,

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.220
and who should keep it.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.000
You could have saved these jobs, but you chose
not to.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.710
In 1932, the New York Times reported on the
“many abuses alleged” among companies

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.560
doing this new stock buyback thing.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.810
Abuses like “using the corporations’ funds
to buy shares from “directors, officers,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.500
and other persons friendly to the management,”
— also known as insider trading.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.320
The President signed a new law to make them
stop: The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.790
It cracked down on manipulation and insider
trading.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.629
Corporations took that to mean that their
buyback days were over.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.999
And they pretty much stopped doing them.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:18.189
And without buybacks for an option, corporations
basically had three choices for what to do

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.939
with their profits.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.209
Option one: reinvest back in the company.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.349
Build new factories.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.870
Create new products.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.980
Option two: raise wages for employees

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.840
Option three: issue a dividend and hand profits
over to investors

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.799
Most American companies did a mix of all three,
with the bulk of profits going towards reinvestment

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:40.909
and wages.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.459
Over time, technology improved.

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.069
Workers made more stuff.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.650
The productivity of American workers nearly doubled in
the thirty years after World War II.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.689
And so did hourly wages.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.010
This helped build the American middle class.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.079
But things didn’t stay that way.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.559
Productivity kept rising, but wages flat lined.

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:08.180
A new political and economic philosophy had
taken hold.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.599
Government is not the solution to our problems.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.090
Government is the problem.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.140
When Ronald Reagan was elected, the Securities and Exchange Act

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.260
had successfully been scaring companies away

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.599
from doing stock buybacks for fifty years.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.790
But that changed after Reagan appointed
a former investment banker named John Shad

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.699
to the top enforcement job.

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:32.150
Shad wanted companies to put less of their
profits into reinvestment and wages.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.140
He thought more should go to investors.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.010
So in 1982, he changed the rules.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.589
For the first time since the 1930s, companies
could buy back shares of their own stock from

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.589
investors.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.019
They didn’t have to worry about the government
coming after them.

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.049
Buybacks were back.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.579
It was a really good time to be an investor.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.329
Investors wanted to keep that money flowing.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.499
So they changed the way CEOs got paid.

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:05.469
Instead of just earning a salary, CEOs could get a bonus if the company’s stock price went up.

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:11.090
The quickest way to raise the stock price
was to do a buyback, so CEOs started doing

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.469
them all the time.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:19.479
In 1982, the biggest American companies spent
less than 1 percent of their profits on stock

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:20.479
buybacks.

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.129
By 2008, just before the recession, that share
had jumped to 77 percent.

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:31.689
Fast forward to today, and companies are spending
65% of their profits buying back shares of

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.370
their own stock.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:42.520
The pay gap between American CEOs and workers
has grown from 15:1 to 220:1 in less than

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.830
a single lifetime.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.050
You can what a uniquely American phenomenon this is when you compare the compensation

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.960
for General Motors' CEO with her counterparts
at Volkswagen in Germany and Toyota in Japan.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.110
And you can see part of the reason for this
gap when you look at how much of their profits

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.139
three companies spend on buybacks.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.530
Volkswagen hasn’t done any since 2012, and
Toyota’s biggest buyback years are roughly

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.360
the size of GM’s smallest.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.000
The more of their profits GM gave to executives
and shareholders, the less was left over for

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.150
reinvestment, and for workers.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.819
In 2000, GM had the largest market share of
any automaker in the world.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.819
By 2017, it had fallen to number 4.

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.360
And as their market share shrank, GM shuttered
plants across the US,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.250
and tens of thousands of workers lost their
jobs.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.600
For decades, this General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio was the biggest employer in the county.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.600
It opened in the 1960s, and started
out making big sedans and muscle cars.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.229
When people's preferences changed or one model
was discontinued, GM would re-tool the plant

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.210
to make a different kind of car.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.840
But in 2015, GM promised investors another
massive stock buyback.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.819
To cut costs,  they started eliminating shifts at the Lordstown plant.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.999
Another cutback— the second shift will be
dropped in two months

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.999
Where am I going to go?

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:18.199
Everybody's got to find a place now.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.939
It is the end of the line for the General
Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:30.219
The cuts come as the automaker is reporting
a near-record $12-billion profit last year.

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:35.120
A few months after the GM plant closed down,
the local supplier that built the rear suspensions

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.719
went out of business.

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.039
Same with the local factory that built the
seats.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.159
Plans for a new hospital building in town
were put on hold.

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:47.349
As paychecks dried up, a local restaurant
closed its doors.

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.999
Economists call it the “multiplier effect.”

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:55.120
One study predicted that every four jobs lost
at GM’s Lordstown plant would trigger three

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.960
more job losses among suppliers and other
local businesses.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.650
That’s why laid off auto workers aren't the only ones in Lordstown who understand the effects of GM’s choices.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.520
So do teachers.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.729
There were some students who just changed
tremendously.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.669
This is all tremendous upheaval for them

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.490
When you look around, you drive around our town, there's a lot of farming,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.710
but General Motors is pretty much the town.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.300
There was a time where the budget was made up mostly of General Motors.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.509
If we lose that revenue from General Motors, that’s going to be really tough for us.

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:30.910
I hesitate to use the word traumatic but it
is.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.669
Because when something this sudden happens, it rocks
your world.

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.860
A year before GM shut down the Lordstown plant,
President Trump and Republicans in Congress

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:46.159
lowered the corporate tax rate from 37 percent
to 21 percent.

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:51.509
Those who supported the cuts predicted that corporations would reinvest those tax savings, and that

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:53.669
workers would benefit the most.

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.970
The vast majority of businesses are going
to do just what we say— reinvest in their

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.389
workers, reinvest in their factories.

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.569
Pay people more money.

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:07.240
When our businesses pay less in taxes, they
reinvest that money into their companies.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.949
But according to the non-partisan Congressional
Research Service, that's not what happened.

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:17.470
The CRS studied the effects of the new tax law
a year and a half after it passed.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.900
And they found “very little growth in wage rates”
among ordinary workers

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:29.030
What they did find was evidence for “a record
breaking amount of stock buybacks, with $1

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.560
trillion announced by the end of 2018”

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.900
For decades, stock buybacks have been secretly
re-shaping the American economy.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.219
And now, politicians are taking notice.

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:46.810
Republican Senator Marco Rubio has suggested
giving extra tax breaks to companies when

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.480
they reinvest their profits instead of doing
buybacks.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.980
Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie
Sanders have called for getting rid of the

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.750
Reagan-era rule that protects companies when
they do buybacks.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.230
They want to make it easier for the SEC to
investigate these companies, in the hopes

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:09.230
that they’ll be too scared to do buybacks,
just like they were in the 1930s.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.959
Warren is also calling for a new rule that
would give workers mandatory seats on corporate

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:14.959
boards.

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:19.880
That way, they’d have a chance to vote on
those big bonuses that CEOs get when a company’s

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.940
stock price goes up.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.080
That’s how German companies have done things
for decades, and buybacks there are way less common.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.540
But in America, they have a long history.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:36.190
Buybacks began in an era when less than 1 percent
of America’s population held nearly a quarter

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.300
of its wealth.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.860
Today, buybacks are back.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.860
And the American economy looks a lot like
it did in the 1920s.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.120
The question now is whether we want it to
stay that way.
