00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.800
Speaker:
Through your achievements
and your words,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.934
you've inspired and encouraged our nation to become a more

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:09.100
perfect union.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.800
In these difficult times, you have challenged us to open our

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.667
minds and work together
to reach common ground.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.700
Your life exemplifies the
power of education to create new

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.867
opportunities and to offer significant contributions to our society.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.533
For all you have accomplished and for your leadership of this

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:36.233
great nation, the University of Michigan is deeply honored to

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:40.266
present you with the honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.533
Congratulations.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:56.000
(cheers and applause)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.333
Speaker:
By the authority of the state of Michigan vested in the Board of

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.633
Regents and by them delegated
to me, I now confer upon you,

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.600
Barack H. Obama, the
degree Doctor of Laws,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.367
and admit you to all of its rights, honors, and privileges.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:15.233
And I (inaudible).

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:29.100
(cheers and applause)

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.200
The President:
Thank you.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.300
(cheers and applause)

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.567
Thank you.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:40.333
(cheers and applause)

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.333
Thank you very much.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.300
Thank you.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.834
(cheers and applause)

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:48.200
Thank you so much.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.567
(cheers and applause)

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:53.266
Thank you very much; thank you.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.600
Thank you, everybody.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.200
Please be seated.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.433
Audience Member:
We love you!

00:01:58.433 --> 00:01:59.700
The President:
I love you back.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.867
(laughter)

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:08.166
It is great to be here
in the Big House --

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:13.000
(cheers and applause)

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.667
-- and so may I say, "Go Blue!"

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:24.100
(cheers and applause)

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.000
I thought I'd go for the cheap
applause line to start things off.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.100
(laughter)

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.900
Good afternoon, President
Coleman, the Board of Trustees,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.767
to faculty, parents, family and
friends of the class of 2010.

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.000
(applause)

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.367
Congratulations on
your graduation,

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:54.567
and thank you for allowing me
the honor of being a part of it.

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:59.767
(applause)

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:01.900
Let me acknowledge your
wonderful governor,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.600
Jennifer Granholm --

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.300
(applause)

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.233
-- your mayor, John Hieftje; and all the members of Congress who

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:15.100
are here today.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.834
It is a privilege to be with you
on this happy occasion, and,

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:23.333
you know, it's nice to spend
a little time outside of Washington.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:26.066
(laughter)

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:33.700
Now, don't get me wrong -- Washington is a beautiful city.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.800
It's very nice living
above the store;

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.266
you can't beat the commute.

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:45.433
(laughter)

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:51.400
It's just sometimes all you hear
in Washington is the clamor of politics.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.967
And all that noise can drown out
the voices of the people who

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.200
sent you there.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.100
So when I took office, I decided
that each night I would read 10

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.900
letters out of the tens of
thousands that are sent to us by

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.633
ordinary Americans every day
-- this is my modest effort to

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:16.333
remind myself of why I
ran in the first place.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:22.500
Some of these letters tell
stories of heartache and struggle.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.200
Some express gratitude,
some express anger.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.567
I'd say a good solid
third call me an idiot --

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:32.767
(laughter)

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:34.734
-- which is how I know
that I'm getting a good,

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.333
representative sample.

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:49.834
(laughter and applause)

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:52.734
Some of the letters
make you think --

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:56.000
like the one that I received
last month from a kindergarten

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.834
class in Virginia.

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:01.300
Now, the teacher of this class
instructed the students to ask

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.166
me any question they wanted.

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:10.700
So one asked, "How
do you do your job?"

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.433
Another asked, "Do
you work a lot?"

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:16.834
(laughter)

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:24.066
Somebody wanted to know if I
wear a black jacket or if I have a beard --

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:26.800
(laughter)

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.467
-- so clearly they were getting me mixed up with the other tall

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:33.033
guy from Illinois.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:41.467
(laughter)

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:46.900
And one of my favorites was from
a kid who wanted to know if I

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.100
lived next to a volcano.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.600
(laughter)

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.033
I'm still trying to piece the
thought process on this one.

00:05:56.033 --> 00:06:02.900
(laughter)

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.767
Loved this letter.

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:08.800
But it was the last question
from the last student in the

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.700
letter that gave me pause.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.066
The student asked, "Are
people being nice?"

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:20.367
Are people being nice?

00:06:20.367 --> 00:06:26.667
Well, if you turn on the
news today, or yesterday,

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:30.900
or a week ago, or a month ago -- particularly one of the cable channels --

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.600
(laughter)

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.266
-- you can see why even a kindergartener would ask this question.

00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:40.633
(laughter)

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:43.233
We've got politicians calling
each other all sorts of

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:45.967
unflattering names.

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:50.433
Pundits and talking heads
shout at each other.

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:53.133
The media tends to play
up every hint of conflict,

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:55.133
because it makes for
a sexier story --

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:58.900
which means anyone interested in
getting coverage feels compelled

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:07.200
to make their arguments as
outrageous and as incendiary as possible.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.233
Now, some of this
contentiousness can be

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:14.367
attributed to the incredibly
difficult moment in which we

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:17.567
find ourselves as a nation.

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:21.100
The fact is, when you leave here
today you will search for work

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.400
in an economy that is still
emerging from the worst crisis

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.367
since the Great Depression.

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:30.400
You live in a century where
the speed with which jobs and

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.033
industries move across the globe
is forcing America to compete

00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:36.433
like never before.

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:38.867
You will raise your children
at a time when threats like

00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:42.033
terrorism and climate change
aren't confined within the

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:45.266
borders of any one country.

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:49.500
And as our world grows
smaller and more connected,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.667
you will live and work with more
people who don't look like you

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:59.767
or think like you or
come from where you do.

00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:05.233
I really enjoyed Alex's remarks
because that's a lot of change.

00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:08.233
And all these changes,
all these challenges,

00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:13.967
inevitably cause some
tension in the body politic.

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:18.233
They make people worry about the
future and sometimes they get

00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:21.367
people riled up.

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:26.967
But I think it's important
that we maintain some historic perspective.

00:08:26.967 --> 00:08:31.867
Since the days of our founding,
American politics has never been

00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:36.200
a particularly nice business.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:42.633
It's always been a little less
gentile during times of great change.

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:45.633
A newspaper of the opposing
party once editorialized that if

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:50.066
Thomas Jefferson were elected,
"Murder, robbery, rape,

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:54.100
adultery, and incest will be
openly taught and practiced."

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.867
(laughter)

00:08:57.867 --> 00:09:02.200
Not subtle.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.100
Opponents of Andrew Jackson
often referred to his mother as

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.700
a "common prostitute," which
seems a little over the top.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:15.567
(laughter)

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:18.200
Presidents from Teddy Roosevelt
to Lyndon Johnson have been

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.367
accused of promoting
socialism, or worse.

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:24.467
And we've had arguments between
politicians that have been

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:28.066
settled with actual duels.

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:30.567
There was even a caning once on
the floor of the United States

00:09:30.567 --> 00:09:33.834
Senate -- which I'm happy to say didn't happen while I was there.

00:09:33.834 --> 00:09:35.233
(laughter)

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:37.000
It was a few years before.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.600
(laughter)

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.900
The point is, politics has never
been for the thin-skinned or the

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.700
faint-of-heart, and if
you enter the arena,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.100
you should expect
to get roughed up.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.633
Moreover, democracy in a nation
of more than 300 million people

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.433
is inherently difficult.

00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:08.233
It's always been noisy and
messy, contentious, complicated.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.900
We've been fighting about
the proper size and role of

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:16.200
government since the days
the Framers gathered in Philadelphia.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.300
We've battled over the meaning
of individual freedom and

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.333
equality since the Bill
of Rights was drafted.

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:25.533
As our economy has shifted
emphasis from agriculture to

00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:28.900
industry, to information,
to technology,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.266
we have argued and struggled at
each and every juncture over the

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:38.033
best way to ensure that all of
our citizens have a shot at opportunity.

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.500
So before we get too depressed
about the current state of our

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.033
politics, let's
remember our history.

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:48.533
The great debates of the past
all stirred great passions.

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:52.667
They all made somebody angry,
and at least once led to a

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:56.700
terrible war.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.233
What is amazing is that
despite all the conflict,

00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:03.834
despite all its flaws
and its frustrations,

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:08.066
our experiment in democracy has
worked better than any form of

00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:10.734
government on Earth.

00:11:10.734 --> 00:11:23.166
(applause)

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:26.300
On the last day of the
Constitutional Convention,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.300
Benjamin Franklin was famously
asked, "Well, Doctor,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.533
what have we got -- a
republic or a monarchy?"

00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:39.200
And Franklin gave an answer
that's been quoted for ages: He

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.700
said, "A republic,
if you can keep it."

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.166
If you can keep it.

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:50.800
Well, for more than 200
years, we have kept it.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.200
Through revolution and civil
war, our democracy has survived.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.033
Through depression and world
war, it has prevailed.

00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:01.467
Through periods of great
social and economic unrest,

00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:04.400
from civil rights
to women's rights,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.934
it has allowed us slowly,
sometimes painfully,

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:12.867
to move towards a
more perfect union.

00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:16.967
And so now, class of 2010, the
question for your generation is

00:12:16.967 --> 00:12:24.000
this: How will you keep
our democracy going?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.900
At a moment when our challenges
seem so big and our politics

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:33.900
seem so small, how will you keep
our democracy alive and vibrant;

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.567
how will you keep it
well in this century?

00:12:38.567 --> 00:12:44.200
I'm not here to offer some
grand theory or detailed policy prescription.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.900
But let me offer a few brief
reflections based on my own

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:53.500
experiences and the experiences
of our country over the last two centuries.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.433
First of all, American democracy
has thrived because we have

00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:02.867
recognized the need for a
government that, while limited,

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:07.633
can still help us adapt
to a changing world.

00:13:07.633 --> 00:13:11.433
On the fourth panel of the
Jefferson Memorial is a quote I

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:15.400
remember reading to my daughters
during our first visit there.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.066
It says, "I am not an advocate
for frequent changes in laws and

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:25.266
constitutions, but...with
the change of circumstances,

00:13:25.266 --> 00:13:31.734
institutions must advance also
to keep pace with the times."

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:34.500
The democracy designed by
Jefferson and the other founders

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.867
was never intended to solve
every problem with a new law or

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:40.367
a new program.

00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:42.200
Having thrown off the tyranny
of the British Empire,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.600
the first Americans were
understandably skeptical of government.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.133
And ever since we've held fast
to the belief that government

00:13:49.133 --> 00:13:52.233
doesn't have all the answers,
and we have cherished and

00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:54.867
fiercely defended our
individual freedom.

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:58.900
That's a strand of
our nation's DNA.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.033
But the other strand is the
belief that there are some

00:14:01.033 --> 00:14:04.934
things we can only do
together, as one nation --

00:14:04.934 --> 00:14:09.834
and that our government must
keep pace with the times.

00:14:09.834 --> 00:14:13.233
When America expanded from a few
colonies to an entire continent,

00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:15.700
and we needed a way
to reach the Pacific,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.433
our government helped
build the railroads.

00:14:20.433 --> 00:14:23.000
When we transitioned from an
economy based on farms to one

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.767
based on factories, and workers
needed new skills and training,

00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:32.533
our nation set up a system
of public high schools.

00:14:32.533 --> 00:14:35.367
When the markets crashed during
the Depression and people lost

00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:38.734
their life savings, our
government put in place a set of

00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:41.934
rules and safeguards to make
sure that such a crisis never

00:14:41.934 --> 00:14:45.567
happened again, and then put a
safety net in place to make sure

00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:52.867
that our elders would never be
impoverished the way they had been.

00:14:52.867 --> 00:14:55.667
And because our markets and
financial systems have evolved

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:58.567
since then, we're now putting in
place new rules and safeguards

00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:01.734
to protect the American people.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.533
Now, this notion --

00:15:03.533 --> 00:15:11.400
(applause)

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.700
This notion, class, hasn't always been partisan.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.533
It was the first Republican
President, Abraham Lincoln,

00:15:19.533 --> 00:15:22.200
who said the role of government
is to do for the people what

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.734
they cannot do better
for themselves.

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:28.600
And he'd go on to begin that
first intercontinental railroad

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.734
and set up the first
land-grant colleges.

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:35.867
It was another Republican,
Teddy Roosevelt, who said,

00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:39.333
"the object of government is
the welfare of the people."

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.800
And he's remembered for using
the power of government to break

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.400
up monopolies, and establish
our National Park system.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.834
(applause)

00:15:53.834 --> 00:15:56.900
Democrat Lyndon Johnson
announced the Great Society

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.734
during a commencement
here at Michigan,

00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:03.333
but it was the Republican
President before him,

00:16:03.333 --> 00:16:05.734
Dwight Eisenhower, who launched
the massive government

00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:10.800
undertaking known as the
Interstate Highway System.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.033
Of course, there have always
been those who've opposed such efforts.

00:16:15.033 --> 00:16:16.767
They argue government
intervention is usually

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:20.400
inefficient; that it restricts
individual freedom and dampens

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.200
individual initiative.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.266
And in certain instances,
that's been true.

00:16:25.266 --> 00:16:27.367
For many years, we had a
welfare system that too often

00:16:27.367 --> 00:16:30.567
discouraged people from taking
responsibility for their own

00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:32.600
upward mobility.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.233
At times, we've neglected
the role of parents,

00:16:36.233 --> 00:16:40.767
rather than government, in
cultivating a child's education.

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:44.567
And sometimes regulation fails,
and sometimes their benefits

00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:48.133
don't justify their costs.

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:51.133
But what troubles me is when
I hear people say that all of

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:53.934
government is inherently bad.

00:16:53.934 --> 00:16:56.700
One of my favorite signs during
the health care debate was

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.734
somebody who said, "Keep Your
Government Hands Out Of My Medicare" --

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:12.400
(laughter)

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.000
-- which is essentially saying "Keep Government Out Of My

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.467
Government-Run
Health Care Plan."

00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:21.600
(laughter)

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.700
When our government is
spoken of as some menacing,

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.433
threatening foreign entity, it
ignores the fact that in our

00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:32.800
democracy, government is us.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.033
We, the people, hold our --

00:17:35.033 --> 00:17:40.934
(applause)

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:43.667
We, the people, hold in our
hands the power to choose our

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:50.500
leaders and change our laws,
and shape our own destiny.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.800
Government is the police
officers who are protecting our

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.934
communities, and the servicemen
and women who are defending us abroad.

00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:08.033
(applause)

00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:11.767
Government is the roads you
drove in on and the speed limits

00:18:11.767 --> 00:18:13.967
that kept you safe.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:16.900
Government is what ensures that
mines adhere to safety standards

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.367
and that oil spills are cleaned
up by the companies that caused them.

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:26.800
(applause)

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.633
Government is this extraordinary
public university --

00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:32.767
a place that's doing
lifesaving research,

00:18:32.767 --> 00:18:36.533
and catalyzing economic growth,
and graduating students who will

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:40.000
change the world around
them in ways big and small.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.166
(applause)

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:49.233
The truth is, the debate we've
had for decades now between more

00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:52.867
government and less government,
it doesn't really fit the times

00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:55.934
in which we live.

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:58.600
We know that too much government
can stifle competition and

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.133
deprive us of choice
and burden us with debt.

00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:07.400
But we've also clearly seen the
dangers of too little government

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.033
-- like when a lack of accountability on Wall Street

00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:13.333
nearly leads to the collapse
of our entire economy.

00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:21.266
(applause)

00:19:21.266 --> 00:19:24.400
So, class of 2010, what we
should be asking is not whether

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.600
we need "big government"
or a "small government,"

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.300
but how we can create a
smarter and better government.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.367
Because in an era
of iPods and Tivo,

00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:38.633
where we have more choices
than ever before --

00:19:38.633 --> 00:19:41.066
even though I can't really
work a lot of these things --

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:44.734
(laughter)

00:19:44.734 --> 00:19:47.800
-- but I have 23-year-olds
who do it for me --

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.166
(laughter)

00:19:52.166 --> 00:19:55.233
-- government shouldn't
try to dictate your lives.

00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:58.533
But it should give you the
tools you need to succeed.

00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:00.633
Government shouldn't try
to guarantee results,

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:04.266
but it should guarantee a
shot at opportunity for every

00:20:04.266 --> 00:20:06.166
American who's
willing to work hard.

00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:10.867
(applause)

00:20:10.867 --> 00:20:19.200
So, yes, we can and should
debate the role of government in our lives.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.266
But remember, as you are asked
to meet the challenges of our

00:20:22.266 --> 00:20:27.567
time, remember that the ability
for us to adapt our government

00:20:27.567 --> 00:20:30.834
to the needs of the age has
helped make our democracy work

00:20:30.834 --> 00:20:34.500
since its inception.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.800
Now, the second way to keep our
democracy healthy is to maintain

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.533
a basic level of civility
in our public debate.

00:20:40.533 --> 00:20:46.233
(applause)

00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:49.934
These arguments we're having
over government and health care

00:20:49.934 --> 00:20:54.600
and war and taxes -- these
are serious arguments.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.667
They should arouse
people's passions,

00:20:57.667 --> 00:21:00.533
and it's important for everybody
to join in the debate,

00:21:00.533 --> 00:21:07.533
with all the vigor that the
maintenance of a free people requires.

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:11.400
But we can't expect to solve our
problems if all we do is tear

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.567
each other down.

00:21:13.567 --> 00:21:17.166
You can disagree with a certain
policy without demonizing the

00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:19.633
person who espouses it.

00:21:19.633 --> 00:21:22.066
You can question somebody's
views and their judgment without

00:21:22.066 --> 00:21:25.633
questioning their motives
or their patriotism.

00:21:25.633 --> 00:21:30.400
Throwing around phrases like
"socialists" and "Soviet-style

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.400
takeover" and "fascist"
and "right-wing nut" --

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.667
(laughter)

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:41.934
-- that may grab headlines,
but it also has the effect of

00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:48.133
comparing our government,
our political opponents,

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:54.300
to authoritarian,
even murderous regimes.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.266
Now, we've seen this kind
of politics in the past.

00:21:56.266 --> 00:21:59.333
It's been practiced by both
fringes of the ideological

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:03.266
spectrum, by the left and the
right, since our nation's birth.

00:22:03.266 --> 00:22:10.700
But it's starting to creep into
the center of our discourse.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.767
And the problem with it is not
the hurt feelings or the bruised

00:22:12.767 --> 00:22:15.433
egos of the public officials
who are criticized.

00:22:15.433 --> 00:22:16.834
Remember, they signed up for it.

00:22:16.834 --> 00:22:18.367
Michelle always
reminds me of that.

00:22:18.367 --> 00:22:22.300
(laughter)

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.400
The problem is that this kind of
vilification and over-the-top

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.967
rhetoric closes the door to
the possibility of compromise.

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:33.800
It undermines democratic
deliberation.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.400
It prevents learning
-- since, after all,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.767
why should we listen to a "fascist," or a "socialist,"

00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:42.633
or a "right-wing nut,"
or a left-wing nut"?

00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:43.934
(laughter)

00:22:43.934 --> 00:22:48.000
It makes it nearly impossible
for people who have legitimate

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.934
but bridgeable differences to
sit down at the same table and

00:22:50.934 --> 00:22:53.600
hash things out.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.000
It robs us of a rational
and serious debate,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.233
the one we need to have about
the very real and very big

00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:04.767
challenges facing this nation.

00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:07.767
It coarsens our culture,
and at its worst,

00:23:07.767 --> 00:23:10.667
it can send signals to the most
extreme elements of our society

00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:15.834
that perhaps violence is
a justifiable response.

00:23:15.834 --> 00:23:17.467
So what do we do?

00:23:17.467 --> 00:23:19.266
As I found out after a
year in the White House,

00:23:19.266 --> 00:23:23.200
changing this type of
politics is not easy.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.834
And part of what civility
requires is that we recall the

00:23:26.834 --> 00:23:31.266
simple lesson most of us learned
from our parents: Treat others

00:23:31.266 --> 00:23:35.633
as you would like to be treated,
with courtesy and respect.

00:23:35.633 --> 00:23:44.967
(applause)

00:23:44.967 --> 00:23:47.633
But civility in this age also
requires something more than

00:23:47.633 --> 00:23:51.967
just asking if we can't
just all get along.

00:23:51.967 --> 00:23:56.200
Today's 24/7 echo-chamber
amplifies the most inflammatory

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.734
soundbites louder and
faster than ever before.

00:23:59.734 --> 00:24:04.500
And it's also, however, given
us unprecedented choice.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.734
Whereas most Americans used to
get their news from the same

00:24:06.734 --> 00:24:10.033
three networks over dinner, or a
few influential papers on Sunday

00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:13.300
morning, we now have the option
to get our information from any

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.367
number of blogs or websites
or cable news shows.

00:24:17.367 --> 00:24:22.433
And this can have both a
good and bad development for democracy.

00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.867
For if we choose only to expose
ourselves to opinions and

00:24:24.867 --> 00:24:28.233
viewpoints that are
in line with our own,

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:30.834
studies suggest that we
become more polarized,

00:24:30.834 --> 00:24:33.834
more set in our ways.

00:24:33.834 --> 00:24:36.166
That will only reinforce and
even deepen the political

00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:38.734
divides in this country.

00:24:38.734 --> 00:24:41.066
But if we choose to actively
seek out information that

00:24:41.066 --> 00:24:43.967
challenges our assumptions
and our beliefs,

00:24:43.967 --> 00:24:46.200
perhaps we can begin to
understand where the people who

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.967
disagree with us
are coming from.

00:24:48.967 --> 00:24:54.266
Now, this requires us to agree
on a certain set of facts to

00:24:54.266 --> 00:24:55.834
debate from.

00:24:55.834 --> 00:24:58.166
That's why we need a vibrant and
thriving news business that is

00:24:58.166 --> 00:25:01.400
separate from opinion
makers and talking heads.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:08.800
(applause)

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.400
That's why we need an educated
citizenry that values hard

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.734
evidence and not just assertion.

00:25:14.734 --> 00:25:21.467
(applause)

00:25:21.467 --> 00:25:24.066
As Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan famously once said,

00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:26.166
"Everybody is entitled
to his own opinion,

00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:28.133
but not his own facts."

00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:32.367
(laughter)

00:25:32.367 --> 00:25:35.000
Still, if you're somebody who
only reads the editorial page of

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.667
The New York Times, try glancing
at the page of The Wall Street

00:25:38.667 --> 00:25:41.500
Journal once in a while.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.100
If you're a fan of Glenn
Beck or Rush Limbaugh,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:50.066
try reading a few columns on
the Huffington Post website.

00:25:50.066 --> 00:25:56.400
It may make your blood boil;
your mind may not be changed.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.900
But the practice of listening to
opposing views is essential for

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.033
effective citizenship.

00:26:02.033 --> 00:26:03.367
(applause)

00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:05.000
It is essential
for our democracy.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.500
(applause)

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.600
And so, too, is the practice
of engaging in different

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.700
experiences with
different kinds of people.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.066
I look out at this class and
I realize for four years at

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:22.734
Michigan you have been exposed
to diverse thinkers and

00:26:22.734 --> 00:26:27.266
scholars, professors
and students.

00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:29.433
Don't narrow that broad
intellectual exposure just

00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:32.166
because you're leaving here.

00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:35.166
Instead, seek to expand it.

00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:38.367
If you grew up in a big city,
spend some time with somebody

00:26:38.367 --> 00:26:40.667
who grew up in a rural town.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:42.500
If you find yourself only
hanging around with people of

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.266
your own race or
ethnicity or religion,

00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:49.467
include people in your circle
who have different backgrounds

00:26:49.467 --> 00:26:51.500
and life experiences.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.533
You'll learn what it's like to
walk in somebody else's shoes,

00:26:54.533 --> 00:26:57.734
and in the process, you will
help to make this democracy work.

00:26:57.734 --> 00:27:07.800
(applause)

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.033
Which brings me to the last
ingredient in a functioning

00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:14.667
democracy, one that's
perhaps most basic --

00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:15.900
and it's already
been mentioned --

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.000
and that is participation.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.600
Class of 2010, I understand that
one effect of today's poisonous

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.834
political climate is to push
people away from participation

00:27:25.834 --> 00:27:28.700
in public life.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.400
If all you see when you turn
on the TV is name-calling,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.700
if all you hear about is how
special interest lobbying and

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.567
partisanship prevented
Washington from getting

00:27:37.567 --> 00:27:41.000
something done, you
might think to yourself,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.834
"What's the point of
getting involved?"

00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:47.133
Here's the point.

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:49.300
When we don't pay close
attention to the decisions made

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.967
by our leaders, when we fail
to educate ourselves about the

00:27:52.967 --> 00:27:56.900
major issues of the day, when we
choose not to make our voices

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.934
and opinions heard, that's
when democracy breaks down.

00:28:00.934 --> 00:28:02.600
That's when power is abused.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.033
That's when the most extreme
voices in our society fill the

00:28:05.033 --> 00:28:07.166
void that we leave.

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:09.200
That's when powerful interests
and their lobbyists are most

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.867
able to buy access and influence
in the corridors of power --

00:28:12.867 --> 00:28:18.400
because none of us are there
to speak up and stop them.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.200
Participation in public life
doesn't mean that you all have

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.200
to run for public office -- though we could certainly use

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.433
some fresh faces in Washington.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:29.900
(laughter and applause)

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:34.300
But it does mean that you should pay attention and contribute in

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.467
any way that you can.

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:38.100
Stay informed.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.100
Write letters, or make phone
calls on behalf of an issue you

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.567
care about.

00:28:42.567 --> 00:28:45.133
If electoral politics
isn't your thing,

00:28:45.133 --> 00:28:48.467
continue the tradition so many
of you started here at Michigan

00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:51.900
and find a way to serve your
community and your country --

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.066
an act that will help you
stay connected to your fellow

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:58.200
citizens and improve the
lives of those around you.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.700
It was 50 years ago that a young
candidate for president came

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.734
here to Michigan and delivered a
speech that inspired one of the

00:29:05.734 --> 00:29:10.000
most successful service
projects in American history.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.100
And as John F. Kennedy described the ideals behind what would

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.000
become the Peace Corps, he issued a challenge to the

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.900
students who had assembled in Ann Arbor on that October night:

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.567
"on your willingness to contribute part of your life to

00:29:27.567 --> 00:29:32.500
this country," he said, will depend the answer whether a free

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.333
society can compete.

00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:40.800
I think it can," he said.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.734
This democracy we have
is a precious thing.

00:29:44.734 --> 00:29:48.266
For all the arguments and all
the doubts and all the cynicism

00:29:48.266 --> 00:29:51.800
that's out there today, we
should never forget that as

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.567
Americans, we enjoy more
freedoms and opportunities than

00:29:55.567 --> 00:29:59.033
citizens in any other
nation on Earth.

00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:02.633
We are free to speak our mind and worship as we please.

00:30:02.633 --> 00:30:04.867
We are free to
choose our leaders,

00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:07.467
and criticize them
if they let us down.

00:30:07.467 --> 00:30:11.266
(applause)

00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:14.000
We have the chance to get an
education, and work hard,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.900
and give our children
a better life.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.533
None of this came easy.

00:30:20.533 --> 00:30:24.066
None of this was preordained.

00:30:24.066 --> 00:30:27.100
The men and women who sat in
your chairs 10 years ago and 50

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.333
years ago and 100 years ago
-- they made America possible

00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:37.600
through their toil and their endurance and their imagination

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.433
and their faith.

00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:46.533
Their success, and America's
success, was never a given.

00:30:46.533 --> 00:30:50.166
And there is no guarantee that
the graduates who will sit in

00:30:50.166 --> 00:30:52.767
these same seats 10 years from
now, or 50 years from now,

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:56.200
or 100 years from now, will
enjoy the same freedoms and

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.200
opportunities that you do.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.066
You, too, will have to strive.

00:31:03.066 --> 00:31:10.400
You, too, will have to push
the boundaries of what seems possible.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.000
For the truth is, our nation's
destiny has never been certain.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.100
What is certain -- what
has always been certain --

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.900
is the ability to
shape that destiny.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.533
That is what makes us different.

00:31:25.533 --> 00:31:28.000
That is what sets us apart.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.333
That is what makes
us Americans --

00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:32.400
our ability at the end of the
day to look past all of our

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.467
differences and all of our
disagreements and still forge a

00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:37.767
common future.

00:31:37.767 --> 00:31:42.767
That task is now in your hands,
as is the answer to the question

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:46.934
posed at this university half a
century ago about whether a free

00:31:46.934 --> 00:31:50.467
society can still compete.

00:31:50.467 --> 00:31:54.867
If you are willing, as past
generations were willing,

00:31:54.867 --> 00:31:59.000
to contribute part of your life
to the life of this country,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.300
then I, like President
Kennedy, believe we can.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.900
Because I believe in you.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.000
(applause)

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.500
Congratulations on
your graduation, 2010.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.100
May God bless you, and may God
bless the United States of America.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.100
Thank you.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.200
(applause)
