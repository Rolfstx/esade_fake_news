00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
You know what’s crazy?

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.240
Uh, so the audience coordinator,
like before I came out, was like,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.640
“Hey, like, there’s uh, there’s a
dude here who looks like your twin.”

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.480
But the whole taping I was like—

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.200
Like, there’s like seven—

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.440
You know what I mean,
like, you, you, like I’m like—

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.920
I don’t know who it is.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.960
The whole time I was looking for that.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.840
Where is it, where’s the twin?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.960
You’re the twin?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the twin?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.240
This is the guy everyone’s like, “He’s the guy?”

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.400
Right here?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.760
Stand on stage, let’s see, let’s—

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.920
How are you? What’s your name?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.920
Prav?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.560
Alright, get it on this camera. Let’s see it.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.760
I don’t know!

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.120
Alright, alright. Next one. Next one.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.400
Yeah, you dude, you, yeah.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.960
Ah, this is too—
this is too, ahh, come on.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.360
Okay, okay, okay.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.840
Wait, do it, let’s go to—

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.320
Alright, let’s go to this
camera. Let’s go to this camera.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.960
Go like this, go like this.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.360
Alright what— put your hand,
put it in this pocket, and then just do this.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.360
No?!

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.720
I think we look the same. Okay.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.400
Eddie, what do you think? What do you think?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.760
It won’t be racist if you say it’s yes.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.680
Yeah.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.280
Come on! Yeah, we do.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.520
Got the beard, we got the—

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.440
Let me see it, let me see it on—

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.440
Aw, come on dude, I’m having fun.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.560
This is a strange question.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.440
“If everyone lost the ability to sneeze,
how long would it take for us to realize it?”

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.640
Dude, I would just assume—

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.080
You know what, I think we would
just assume we’re super healthy.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.240
Like, “Ah, I don’t sneeze
’cause I’m super healthy.”

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.360
That’s all.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.400
How long do you think?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.320
Six months?

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.440
You would legitimately have that thought?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.040
“Wow, I haven’t sneezed in...

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.200
a good half year.”

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.520
Would you miss it?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.640
Would you miss sneezing?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.320
Would it be like one of those things like,
remember like in Children of Men there’s no kids?

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.760
Would we— would we long for
sneezing like the way they do in that?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.840
“There was one person
on Earth who could sneeze.”

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.640
Are your sneezes weird? Mine sound
like— I sound like a little mouse, you know?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.400
I try to like hide it. I’m like, eh!

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.680
Do you know how some
people have like really loud ones?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.200
Yeah. What’s yours like?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.840
You’ve never been told?

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.120
Every time I’ve sneezed
people are like, “Are you alright?”

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.920
“Do you have a secret?
Like you’re hiding it.”

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.800
You know what?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.440
The scariest thing about sneezing is
the fact that you’ll do it when you’re driving.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.040
How are more
people just not dying?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.520
Every time you just
switch lanes on a sneeze?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.560
Think about how many, like, car accidents
would be happening just because of that.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080
Dude, if you’re an Athiest
and you don’t believe—

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.040
Like I’m, every time I’ve like sneezed
while changing a lane and I live, I’m like,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.080
“Dude, there is a God.”

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.760
This is like, for sure for sure.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.040
“What is a weird NYC subway
talent you wish you could have?”

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.600
Um, it would definitely be the dudes
with the boom boxes doing flips.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.960
And then sometimes on the subway,
there’s the dude who can like, hang vertically

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.080
and do, and go perpendicular.
Can go full 90 degrees.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.280
That’s... that’s pretty dope.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.000
Um...

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.800
I get nervous though.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.600
’Cause they usually ask for money
and I have a— like, you know, I’ll stare.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.640
I just have this problem
where I’ll just stare.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.280
A lot of us have
that problem, right?

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.160
Indian people just stare.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.760
And they’ll always be like,
“Ah, this guy, this guy’s having a good time!”

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.680
And I’m like, “I am, no!”

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.840
“Like, I’m having the best time right now!”

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
“Where’s the money at?”

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.040
And I’ll always panic ’cause I don’t have cash.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.480
Like, nobody carries cash these days.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.320
Sometimes I’ll be like,
“Do you take Venmo?”

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.120
And they’re like, “No!
We gotta get to the next car!”

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.360
I’m like, “I’m sorry.”

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.160
You know what’s wild to me?

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.600
The fact that we don’t want
to engage with them and yet,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.360
most people are like scrolling on Twitter.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.120
But you would watch somebody
doing crazy backflips on your phone.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.960
But we wouldn’t wanna see it live!

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.840
Isn’t that weird?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.040
Do we hate— is it the choice?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.440
Is it the fact that we—

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.680
Oh, be able to opt in.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.040
You’re like, “I don’t want people backflipping at—”

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.520
Is communiting the
worst part of living in New York?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.720
What’s your commute?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.440
Uh huh.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.200
Oh man.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.200
Yeah... When I first moved to New York that
was the one piece of advice everyone gave me.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.720
They’re like, “Just don’t commute.
Live across the street from work.”

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.760
And I actually did that. I lived in Times Square.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.000
Yeah, it was right by The Daily Show, so...

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.240
every day I just saw, like,
people dressed up as M&amp;M’s.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.000
It was— I was like, “Is this New York City?”

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.480
And then Michael Che told
me he lived literally across the street.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.360
And I was like,
“I gotta move across the street.”

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.160
Like, even ten blocks is too much.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.280
So I moved across the street and
then I convinced every other correspondent

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.520
to move into that building.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.440
It was very clutch.
It’s like a two minute commute. It’s incredible.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.240
I mean, Manhattan is very
boring, but... Like, that part of Manhattan.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.920
This part of— this area’s
pretty, pretty boring, but...

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.160
I had to come to— like I came to just a
point in my life, ’cause Jessica Williams was like,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160
“Move to Brooklyn. Everyone’s cool in Brooklyn.”

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.480
And I really had to like look
myself in the mirror and I’m like,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.520
“I’m not cool.”

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.920
I’m not that cool.
I’m not gonna do cool things.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.920
“Would you rather have to rock
the Zuckerberg haircut for an entire year

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.000
or go one full winter in which
your only footwear option is Crocs?”

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.360
Crocs!

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.120
Hundred-percent Crocs.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.480
They’re on my feet and they’re really comfortable.
I don’t care what people say, they’re super comfortable.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.120
I have them at home. They’re great.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.840
They’re great for dry or wet situations.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.200
They’re awesome.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.960
Um, yeah.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.240
Damn, Anjali. Do you not—
You also find Zuckerberg’s hairline super weird

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.480
You would do that hair more than Crocs?

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.720
Really?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.920
Okay, your rule wasn’t Crocs all the time.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.240
It was just wear Crocs.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.080
Oh, “or go one full winter in which” —
Oh, I’m sorry, like reading comprehension.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.920
I’m sorry.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.320
“Go one full winter in which
your only footwear option is Crocs.”

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.520
I’ll double up on socks and do Crocs.
I’ll double up on socks and do Cr—

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.320
No socks?!

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.160
You’re changing the rules!
You can’t just do that.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.720
You’re like, “No socks,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720
and we chop off one of your feet. Now what?”

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.080
No, come on.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.680
You just said Crocs.
I go double—

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.000
Really?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.840
You would want to see me with the weird ass...

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.320
like his Caesar that’s off?

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.360
It’s not even ri— like, 
come on, dude. You went to Harvard.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.760
The angle isn’t even right.
It’s not even straight.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.760
I think it’s a power move.
He’s just like, “Yeah, say something about it.”

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.640
Alright, “What’s your hottest take
that you’re afraid to tell people?”

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.960
Oh wow.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.160
That’s like a Reddit question where
you’re like, “Alright, anonymous.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.320
How do you really feel about the world?”

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.160
Look, I have a lot of hot takes but
um, there was this video actually.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.000
It was over the Thanksgiving holiday,
did you guys see it?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.240
Of that one guy at the Thanksgiving table
and he had a bunch of hot takes.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.480
Did you see this on Twitter?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.520
Just play it real quick.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:27.200
Let’s say there was a like, apex predator like
Bigfoot, there wouldn’t be, like thousands of them.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.400
There would only be a few.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.480
Aliens are an absolute certainty.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.720
In an ever expanding universe,
the probability of human life–

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.280
You can agree, humans exist, right?

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.400
You’re here, ’kay?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.560
That probability’s so low.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.160
How about Jeffrey Epstein?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.880
Did you see, like the two cops, the two 
prison guards got arrested for– yeah.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.760
Why do, why do people enjoy swimming pools?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.840
Go to, go to the beach.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.160
Russia... Russia interfered in the elections.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.040
A hundred percent.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.360
So I was on Twitter and I’m like, “This guy’s
incredible, he needs to do Deep Cuts with me.”

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.840
I went down the rabbit hole I’m like,
“Who is he? His name’s Bashir.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.760
Alright, find Bashir– there’s a lot of Bashirs.”

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.760
And I found him.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.160
And he came to the taping!

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.960
This is Bashir.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.760
This is the dude.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.960
This is what Deep Cuts is all about.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.400
It’s just pure passion,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.560
no evidence to back it up.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.800
Bashir, what’s up man, how are you?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.080
– (I’m doing well, man.)
– Thank you for coming from D.C., man.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.640
Did you– did you know that this clip
was just gonna go crazy like this?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.480
(Oh, not at all.)

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:20.840
Really?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.280
(Yeah.)

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.800
Did you know your sister was recording you?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.880
(Not until like– I mean, that was like an
hour and a half conversation she cut up.)

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.160
(It was the whole dinner.)

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.240
My favorite part was when you’re just,
you’re just like, “There are definitely aliens.”

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.800
“Think of the statistical probability of us
being here. You believe we’re here, right?”

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.000
I’m like, that is such, that is such–

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.240
(I had to convince them.)

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.120
“This is real, right?”

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.720
Oh my God.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.680
And then I know– Are those your
family members around you?

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.000
(Yeah.)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.520
Like cousins and stuff like that?

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.720
The burly bearded dude is like
a cousin, right, or something like that?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.640
(Uh, it’s my brother.)

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.280
That’s your brother?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.760
(Yeah.)

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.560
I could so tell like, he’s the one who’s
like– He’s sat, he was just like–

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.080
Your mom’s reaction was incredible.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.720
Is she just tired of it?

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.000
(Uh, you know, she’s learned to love me.)

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.400
Alright, look, I gotta ask you– I wanna
hear about some of your hot takes, okay?

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.560
(I’m in.)

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.680
Here we go.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.080
Um, this is from the video.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.160
What’s your take on aliens in Area 51?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.960
(Aliens are out there, hundred percent.)

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.800
(I don’t know about Area 51. I don’t
trust the government. You shouldn’t.)

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.720
(But like, mathematically, Fermi’s
Paradox like, read into it.)

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.440
(Like, mathematically it’s a certainty.
It’s all but a certainty.)

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.160
What do you mean it’s all but a certainty?

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.560
(The universe is ever expanding.)

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.320
Okay.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.400
(And we are here.)

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.200
(So like, at the... so.)

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.080
Bro, that was such– That was such
like a Middle Eastern uncle move.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.600
Go ahead. We’re here, yeah, I believe it.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.000
(So there’s at least one chance, one outcome
where it has worked in the whole universe.)

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.480
Uh huh.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.160
(And if it’s, like, ever expanding, it’s going
to happen again if it hasn’t already.)

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.560
I believe it, look I believe it.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.280
It’s like,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.160
I believe it but I also– it’s a 50/50.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.120
(Well see, there’s a space force now.)

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.520
Yeah...

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.840
– (Government’s making that, I’m just saying.)
– Yeah, yeah.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.840
That’s never gonna happen, man, come on.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.240
Apex predators?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.960
(So that’s Bigfoot. So, Bigfoot...)

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.840
Wait, wait, wait.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.480
Bigfoot is– is called an apex predator?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.560
(He is a apex predator.)

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560
(One of them.)

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.880
What are the other ones?

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.040
(I don’t know, humans and sharks.)

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.440
We’re an apex predator?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.680
– (Giant squids.)
– You’re gonna put Bigfoot and humans on the same level?

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.440
For real?

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.600
(I’m sorry, Mom.)

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:41.240
(Um, like, but it’s just something that
like, it’s the top of the food chain.)

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.920
(And the reasoning to why Bigfoot
exists tying it to apex predators is

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.920
that’s why we don’t necessarily like, see
the fossils or know for sure it’s around.)

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.280
(Like there wouldn’t be a lot of them.)

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.320
(Like, only a few would survive.)

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.280
(Dude, tell me why there’s a Yeti and a Sasquatch?)

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.560
(Like, like the myth is like, throughout the world.)

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.120
What?

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.080
For real?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.120
What do you mean there is a Yeti and a Sasquatch?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.640
Singular? There’s one?

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.320
– (Like, yeah, like the story.)
– Like, “Ah, you gotta go to Beijing,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.360
they have the Yeti there.”

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.160
What do you mean by that?

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.080
(Like, like, the stories like, lasted
through like different cultures.)

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.200
– Sure.
– (Like, Pacific Northwest of the U.S.)

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.800
Okay.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.160
(And then like, out in like, Southern Southeast Asia.)

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.680
Yes.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.160
(It’s there in like Nepal and whatnot.)

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.720
Yeah.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.760
So mermaids exist, too?

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.920
(Vampires. Yeah.)

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.680
Vampires? Shut– Come on!

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.360
Alright, swimming pools are better than the beach.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.760
(Yo, that’s, that’s the most important.)

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.840
(Yeah, swimming pools are horrible.)

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.000
Why, why are they horrible?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.800
(Alright, it's– It’s a hole in the ground
with bodily fluids and like, dead skin

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.760
that you have to like chemically
treat to make them usable.)

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.520
– (Like, just use the ocean.)
– Versus the ocean?

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.840
– (The ocean at least–)
– Has whale–

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.920
it has whale shit in it, it has fish shit in it.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.520
(Trillions and trillions of gallons of water.)

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.040
So you’re done– Did you have a bad
experience with swimming pools?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.960
(My dad was obsessed with pools.)

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.240
(We’d go like, like South Carolina, we’d be
like five minutes from the beach.)

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.280
(And he’d insist we’d go to like
spend the day at the pool. Like...)

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.280
So just say that.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.000
Alright, what’s your take on bread bowls?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.960
(Uh, amazing. I love them.)

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.120
They’re great. That’s a great one, yeah.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.960
Bread bowls are legit.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.560
They’re very divisive though, people are like, “Fuck
bread bowls, it’s too much bread, not enough soup.”

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.800
(Penicillin, iPhones, bread bowls. Same–)

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.160
Penicillin, iPhones, and bread bowls?

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.280
(Greatest inventions ever.)

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.360
What?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.480
That’s incredible, man.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.400
Uh,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.800
dudes who wear backwards hats.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.600
(I get it, like they’re douchebags
or whatever. Like, fuckboys.)

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.480
(I ran my student government campaign in college with
like a backwards cap as like the approachable guy.)

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.760
(Like, we won, so like, I can’t like, shit on it too much.)

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.640
That was how you– What school did you go to?

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.960
(University of Cincinnati. Go Bearcats.)

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.920
So that’s how you, you’re like,
“I have to connect to Ohio voters.”

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.280
Put on a backwards cap.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.800
Really?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.960
And you won?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.440
(Barely.)

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.560
By 60 votes?

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.240
But, but, University of– That’s dope, dude.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.240
So you won president?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.600
(Yeah.)

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.440
You’re a Muslim president.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.400
(Yeah.)

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.520
Are you serious?

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.560
That’s gangster.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.280
You pulled it off?

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:22.760
(Yeah, yeah.)

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.560
Dude, you did what– Damn, and
you didn’t even have to like, Barack it.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.520
Like, “Ah, no I’m not.”

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.840
(No, no. I was the opposite.)

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.000
Barack, come home. Come home.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.360
Baby Yoda. Baby Yoda.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.480
(Oh, dude, I’d die for Baby Yoda.)

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.920
– You’d die?
– (I didn’t get it til I saw the show.)

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.880
You would die for Baby Yoda?

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.200
(I mean, I’d kill for Baby Yoda.)

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.120
You’re like, “I don’t wanna take my life.
I would commit manslaughter.”

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.680
Alright, these were takes that you sent us.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:52.920
(Alright.)

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.200
You sent our producers.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.960
High top tables suck.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.680
(They’re the worst.)

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.360
(I mean you mentioned it during
the Patriot Act like, about stools.)

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.240
Stools are bullshit.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.080
– (Dude, first of all, you’re a tall guy.)
– Stools are fuckin’ garbage.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.000
(Imagine, most people are shorter than you.)

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.760
(It’s height-ist. High top tables.)

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.240
What?!

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.320
(You ever at a high top table you drop something you
gotta get, like, down like do a whole thing, like...)

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.560
Alright, The Office is a depressing TV show,.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.680
(Yeah, yeah I don’t like The Office.)

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.560
Yeah, yeah, come on! The Office?!

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.480
Steve Carrell. That version?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.280
(Steve Carrell’s awesome. Sure the writers
are great, I never got into it from the beginning.)

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.840
(But you’re telling me like you’re gonna
take The Office over 30 Rock?)

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.640
– (Like, Parks and Rec, Seinfeld?)
– (Yeah.)

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.480
(Unbelievable. Alright, whatever. You guys are sad.)

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.840
Convince them! Convince them!

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840
Don’t let them bully you!

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.040
Make this your fuckin’ Thanksgiving table.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.080
Tell us why The Office is depressing.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:49.160
(Alright, alright. So, in TV shows you want
to like, see, like the optimal like, life or laugh

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.320
or like, see whatever that like,
you would enjoy for yourself.)

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.400
(You’re telling me you want to
sell paper for the rest of your life?)

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.400
(You want like a boss that like, is pretty like,
incompetent and you just like, laugh at him?)

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.200
(Like, it’s a sad show when you
get down to the nitty gritty.)

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.440
Did you like Breaking Bad?

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.320
(I never saw Breaking Bad.)

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.400
Did you like, did you like Game of Thrones?

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.000
(Yeah.)

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.800
Okay–

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.880
So motherfuckers are dying.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.440
We’re talking about, there’s incest and dragons.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.720
(But there’s like–)

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.200
And you’re like, “Yeah, the job you want.”

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.240
Are you serious?

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.320
(I’d ride a dragon.)

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.240
“Was it a tough decision to go back to
the original pronunciation of Hasan?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.520
I wrote my college essay on my name,
so I thought it was super interesting.”

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.400
Oh wow, that’s heavy.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.240
This is from, this you, Prav?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.360
You wrote your whole college essay– my lookalike?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.000
Yeah, but what’s– Is your name Prav?

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.240
That’s it?

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.800
Yeah.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.720
So, what do you do?

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960
So what do you do, you hit it with the full–

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.920
For me it was like this–

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.280
Like, I remember when I first started comedy.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.320
At the first open mics, there was this host–
You’d write your name down and he’s like,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.440
“Look man nobody’s gonna be able to pronounce
this, you gotta change your name.”

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.280
And I legit thought it was like a real thing.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.800
He’s like, “Come on man, you think there’s
a guy named Jamie Foxx, he changed his name.”

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.200
And he did.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.480
So for like, two months, I would go
to open mics and I was Sean.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.480
And I’m like, “Dude, what am I doing?”

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.640
Legit I was like, “I’m Sean, right?”

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.040
Yeah.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.520
Like, “Hey what’s up guys, I’m Sean,” right?

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.880
You know what I mean?

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.840
And then I remember, I kept trying to negotiate, right?

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.040
So I was like, all right, Hasan, people
can pronounce Hasan.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.320
And um, I don’t know, it just got weirder and weirder.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.080
You know, I met so many people, um, a lot of people
even in the Southeast Asian community

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.320
you’ll have people who are like, “This is my
Chinese name, this is my American name.”

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.000
But I’m like dude, “Fuck that. Your name’s your name.”

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.040
And then there’s people like in my
community like, there’s Bobby Jindal.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.840
I’m like, “Bro, your name’s not Bobby.”

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.240
Your name’s Piyush, right?

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.480
But he went from Piyush and he just took a hard
right and he’s like, “Ahh, can’t do that, Bobby.”

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.160
It was like, we had like, an uncle in our
community, his name was Iqbal.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.720
But then one time he picked up his cellphone
and he’s like, “Hello this is Alex.”

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.320
And I’m like, “Who the fuck is Alex?”

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.880
And um,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.840
but I would always have that like open mic host in my head,
like, “Oh, you gotta do it to make it,” and all that stuff.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.800
And I remember being at Ellen, and my parents
drove down from Sacramento to be there.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.600
Like, Mom and Dad are sitting there,
I’ve been doing comedy fifteen years.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.520
And Ellen’s just like, “Hey Hasan!”

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.960
I looked in the audience, my mom’s kinda
sitting like, right where you guys are.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.120
She kinda cringed.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.480
You know, she left the VA, checked
out of work, “Hey, I’m sick.”

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.720
Drives down to see her son on Ellen
and she’s like, “Hasan Minhaj.”

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.040
And my mom who gave me
that name is just like, “Eugh.”

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.120
And I’m like, dude what am I doing?

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.840
Like, I have a show with my fuckin’ name
on it and I’m still being like, “It’s with Sean!”

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.280
You know?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.960
And so I was like, “Alright, Ellen,
just let’s do this right now.”

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.400
’Cause we can pronounce Timothée Chalamet,
so we’re gonna do this right now.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.040
And so, you know I just had her do it.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.200
And uh, I didn’t know it would be
this like, viral moment or whatever.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.480
But I remember my dad when we drove
home, he was super pissed at me.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.880
He’s like, “Hasan, you wasted your chance.
You had seven minutes with her,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.160
for four minutes you’re correcting her.
Why are you doing this?”

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.920
And I think that’s like the big difference between
our generation and our parents’ generation.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.000
They’re always trying to survive.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.160
And I mean survival is the thing so
just go by whatever she calls you.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.040
And that’s cool, I think when Dad, you know,
when he came in ’82 he survived for us.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.840
But I’m trying to live.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.440
I mean I’m trying to like, “Yo, Muhammad
Ali, say my name. Like, say it.”

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:46.680
So, I’m gonna go on Ellen, the most American
show ever, and make you hit all the syllables.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.520
I mean that’s like… for me.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.480
Alright, thank you guys.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.480
I appreciate you.
