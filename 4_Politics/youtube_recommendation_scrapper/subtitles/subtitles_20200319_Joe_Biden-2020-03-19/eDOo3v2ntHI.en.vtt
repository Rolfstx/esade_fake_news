00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.839
[music playing]

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:19.686
Female Speaker: 2009,

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.954
Inauguration Day.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.288
Female Speaker:
Inaugural Ball.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.823
They walked out, she had
on that gorgeous

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:24.657
white dress.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:29.028
Male Speaker: What's
the guy's name? Luther.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.463
Jerry Seinfeld: Knocking
on the Oval Office window,

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:31.431
I would say.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.367
That was probably the peak
of my entire existence.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.702
Female Speaker: The
moment when he picked me.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.605
I was so happy, I have to
like -- I have to be

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.207
the last question.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.308
The President: Before I
answer your question, why

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.309
don't you give
me a little rap.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.245
Let's see what you got.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.414
Female Speaker: I was so
emotional, I was crying.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:50.383
Thank you, President Obama, for coming to Vietnam.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.584
Female Speaker: It's the
first time in my life I

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.654
felt like the White House
belonged to everybody.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.023
Kerry Washington: And you
really felt -- you felt

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.158
those first three words of

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.826
the Constitution, "We the People."

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.594
It was one of those first
times in my life that I

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.964
felt like I was really
part of that "We."

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.467
Female Speaker: My Obama
moment was when I received

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:11.237
this letter from President
Obama last year welcoming

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.373
me to become a U.S. citizen.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.109
Tom Hanks: When he just
changed all the rules on

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.111
the table in
regards to Cuba.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.080
With the most succinct
motivation imaginable,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.652
which is, "What we've been
doing hasn't worked."

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.487
Which made all the
sense in the world.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.988
Male Speaker: My Obama
moment was the signing of

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.124
the Paris Agreement, and
making the United States a

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.493
leader in the fight
against global warming.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.427
Leonardo DiCaprio:
When I was at the U.N.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:37.630
and I, you know, I heard
our President say that

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.301
climate change is the most
important issue facing not

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.703
only this generation, but
all future generations.

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.004
It was inspiring.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.539
Melinda Gates: For me, it
was traveling with the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.576
President to
schools in Boston.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:52.679
And the way he engaged the
students was just one of

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.515
those moments to see him
connect like that, that I

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.650
think you see throughout
his Presidency.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.985
Female Speaker: My
favorite President Obama

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.589
moment was when he was
elected President in 2008,

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.591
because in 2008 was
when I was born.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.326
John Legend: I never cried
before from election

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.027
results (laughs).

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.295
Female Speaker: I don't
know, just the magic

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.263
of that moment.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.899
Of that man who we'd all
been on that journey with

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.802
take that stage
with his family.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.403
I was sitting at home in
my living room and I felt

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.473
like I was a part of
that crowd in that park.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.877
Male Speaker: I didn't
think I would live to see

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:29.649
a African American emerge
as President, but he did.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.850
Female Speaker: Third
grade, when we had this

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.553
project to write a letter
to the White House.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.588
It was really strange when
he actually replied back

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.490
because it was like,
"Woah, I'm a third grader

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.025
and I can actually get

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.293
a response from the President.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.028
I can actually
make a difference."

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:43.530
Male Speaker: In the
aftermath of the school

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.900
shootings in Connecticut.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.468
I don't know
how he did it.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:52.038
Male Speaker: At one
point, at the lectern, he

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:55.575
started to sing "Amazing
Grace," and the entire

00:02:55.575 --> 00:03:01.447
congregation stood
up and did the same.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:05.852
And to me, it was just
a powerful moment.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.688
One that the nation needed
and one that he

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.790
was able to provide.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.259
Chance the Rapper: His
battle towards the end to

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.396
pardon a lot of convicted
felons who had been given

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:19.966
heavy sentences for small,
drug-related crimes.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.734
Female Speaker: One
portion I remember most

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.636
about the visit was how
excited everybody

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.672
in my house was.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.007
And especially all the
young people who were

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:31.778
helping us, and I think
the way they got so

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.281
excited and happy about it
was something that I will

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.816
always remember.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.117
Male Speaker: When the
President of the United

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.720
States lit the first ever
Dia [phonetic sp.] in the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.888
White House as a symbol

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.556
of the Hindu Festival of Lights.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.791
Female Speaker: President
Obama put sexual violence

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.026
on the map as an issue.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:49.395
Survivors can now speak
about their experiences

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.663
without shame.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.865
It's been amazing to be
a part of that movement.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.834
Samuel L. Jackson: The moment that, you know, we got the

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.502
Affordable Care
Act passed.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.371
Because I have relatives
that, you know, can't

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.974
afford health insurance,
so it was really a great

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.542
thing to know that

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:03.509
something happened to them.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.544
They'd get cared for.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.679
Male Speaker: The
excitement we had when the

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.514
Affordable Care
Act became a law.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:12.418
My particular case, I have
a pre-existing condition

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.822
which was finally able to
be cared for medically.

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:18.424
Male Speaker: When Obama
came out and spoke for

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.692
same-sex marriage.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.662
Female Speaker: Him
showing support towards

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:27.967
trans, separately from
LGBT from sexuality.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:30.169
Just, like, "Go, Obama!"

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.071
Female Speaker: The most
memorable Obama moment for

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.906
me is when he said,
"Eat your peas."

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.376
The President:
Eat our peas.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.478
Female Speaker: Which
means, just do it or get

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:40.880
the most important
things done first.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.315
Ellen DeGeneres: The CVS
experience with Michelle

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.951
was pretty cool.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.956
And dancing with Barack at
his birthday party, and

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.424
he's a good
dancer, you know.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.026
He should not get
any flack for that.

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.560
You're a good dancer.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.665
Female Speaker: He's my
role model, my idol,

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:01.200
because I want
to be President.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.669
Female Speaker: When he
wished Happy New Year to

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.404
all the Iranian Americans
and he said

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:08.741
[foreign language] live on
CNN, perfectly.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.710
Michael Jordan: I often do
remember Jackie Robinson,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.978
everybody does.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.746
To me, he would be the
Jackie Robinson of

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.348
politics from
my standpoint.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.150
Male Speaker: He told
everybody to clear out of

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.719
the way, and the kid
went and pressurized the

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.121
marshmallow gun and
they launched it.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.224
The President: Oh!

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:27.260
Male Speaker:
So, Obama out.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.494
Kobe Bryant: Dropped the
mic on them,

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.296
blew the kiss.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:33.666
And when I saw that, it
absolutely blew me away.
