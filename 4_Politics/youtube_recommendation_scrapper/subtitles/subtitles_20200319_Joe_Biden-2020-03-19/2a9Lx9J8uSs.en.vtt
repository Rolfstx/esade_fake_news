00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.560
good night

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.370
testing 1 million two million three okay

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.400
I I came from Nebraska today and that
you're probably all familiar with us

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.570
mainly by our football team we have
those fellows with the the bingo white

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.390
helmets with those red hands on

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.110
I asked one of our starters the other
day what's the end stand when he said

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.110
knowledge

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.930
ok we can make a ton of though I mean
that you know coaster Nebraska

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.379
just because you're a football player
with that they made your in agricultural

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:02.159
economics and there's a to question
final for all of the fires and first

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.789
question is what are all mcdonald have
and

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.060
they were giving that to one of our
potential Heisman Trophy winners the

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.650
other day and he started this swept
finally right now is a farm pressure in

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.060
the light of course you don't want to
find a Heisman candidate uh so I said

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.320
now he said you're halfway home

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.070
he said just one more question how do
you spell far

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.860
I think I really starts to sweat and he
looks at the ceiling and he looks around

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.590
five his face by itself

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.500
he says he I all so much for that guy
sure it will be done right now

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.350
I look I really want to talk about what
side your mind so we're going to do a

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.560
Q&amp;A and the men and I I there's a couple
questions i always get asked you know I

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.030
always did always say well we should i
go to work for when i get out then I've

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.150
got a very simple answer we we may
elaborate more on this as we go along

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.850
but another the real thing to do is to
get going in first

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.360
some institution or individual that you
admire

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.220
I mean it's crazy to take in between
jobs just because they look good on your

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.700
resume or because you get a little
higher starting pay i was up at Harvard

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.030
while back and very nice young guys pick
me up at the airport

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.850
Harvard Business School attending and he
said look he said I went to undergrad

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.760
here and then I worked for x and y and z
and now I've come here and he said I

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.130
thought it would really round up my
resume perfectly if I want to work now

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.810
for a big management consulting firm and
I said what is that what you want to do

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.130
he said nobody said that's the perfect
resume and I said well what are you

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.860
going to start doing what you like and
he said well I'll get to that someday

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.580
and I said well you know I said your
plan sounds to me a lot like saving up

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.870
sex for your old age

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.490
it just doesn't make a lot of sex

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.240
head I told that same girl I said you're
not going to work for every admire the

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.330
most and I said you can't get a bad
result of jump out of bed in the morning

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.340
and you'll be having fun being called me
up a couple weeks later said what you

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.590
tell us gets he said they're all
becoming self-employed so you've got

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.840
you've got a temper that advice a little
bit

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.400
ah play one game a little bit with me
for just a minute and then roll up that

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:35.159
will get to your questions and I'd like
for the moment to have you a lot that

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:41.280
heavy pretend i made you a great offer
and I've told you that you could pick

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.159
any one of your classmates in you now
know each other

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:47.669
probably pretty well after being here
for a while you can thank you have 24

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.479
hours to think it over and you can pick
any one of your classmates and you get

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:58.889
ten percent of their earnings for the
rest of their lives and I ask you what

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:06.180
goes through your mind in determining
which one of those who would pick you

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.539
can pick the one with the richest father
that doesn't count on me you gotta gotta

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:14.969
do this on merit but you probably
wouldn't pick the person against the

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:16.560
highest grades in the class

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.520
I mean that at all we're getting is
grades in the class but that that's not

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:28.889
that isn't going to be the quality that
but that sets apart a big winner from

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:30.240
the rest of the pack

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.649
think about who we would pick and why
and I think you'll find when you get

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:35.430
through

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.630
you'll pick some individual you've all
got the ability you wouldn't be here

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.579
otherwise you've all got the energy

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:45.329
I mean you've got it out here did the
initiative is here

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:50.399
the intelligence is here throughout the
class but some of your going to be

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:55.980
bigger winners and others had it gets
down to a bunch of qualities that

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.980
interestingly enough you are our self
made

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.190
I mean it's not how tall you are not
willing to kick a football 60 yards is

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.070
not whether you could run the
hundred-yard dash

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.070
ten seconds it's that whether the
best-looking person in the room

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.200
it's a whole bunch of qualities that
really come out of Ben Franklin or the

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.390
Boy Scout colder so whatever it may be I
mean it'sit's its integrity is honesty

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.040
it's its generosity it's it's being
willing to do more than your share its

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.830
it's just all those qualities that are
self selected and then if you look on

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.100
the other side of the ledger because
there's always a catch to these you know

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.600
free gifts in June a joke so you'll also
have to this is the fun part

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.670
you also have to sell short one of your
classmates and pay ten percent of what

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.300
they do

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.390
so what do you think is going to do the
worst in the class is a great more fun

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.380
and think about it again and again it
wasn't the plan but it isn't the person

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.440
with the lowest grades or anything of
the sort

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.970
it's the person who just doesn't shape
up in the character department when we

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.960
look for three things when we hire
people we look for intelligence we look

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.450
friend for initiative or energy and we
look for integrity and if they don't

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.500
have the ladder

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.470
the first tool kill you because if
you're going to get somebody without

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.470
integrity you want to be lazy and down

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:21.110
I mean you don't want to get a lot of
smart and energetic self is that third

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.200
quality and but everything about that
quality is your choice

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.580
you know you you can't change the way
you are wired much but you can change a

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.320
lot of what you do with that wiring and
it's the habits that you generate now on

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.220
those qualities or those negative
qualities i mean the person the person

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.990
who always you know claimed credit for
things they didn't do that always cuts

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.830
corners that the can't count on getting
it in the end

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.370
those those are habit patterns and the
time to form the right habits is one

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.370
year when you're your age I mean it duh

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.720
it doesn't do me much good to get golf
lessons now if I got the golf lessons

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.290
when I was your age I might be a decent
offer but but it

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.420
someone once said the chains of habit or
two are too light to be felt until

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.110
they're too heavy to be broken and i see
that all the time i see people with have

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.830
a patterns that

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.000
her self destructive when they're 50 or
60 and they think they really can't

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.860
change their imprisoned by that but
you're not in prison by anything so when

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.550
you write down the qualities of that
person that you'd like to buy to ten

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.350
percent of look at that list and ask
yourself is there anything on that list

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.510
i couldn't do the answers

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.750
there are there won't be and when you
look at the person yourself short

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.340
and you look at those qualities that you
don't like if you see any of those in

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.630
yourself

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.040
he could tell them whatever maybe
selfishness you can get rid of that I

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.180
mean that is not ordained and if you
follow that you and Ben Franklin did

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.540
this in my old boss Ben Graham did this
of early ages in their young teens they

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.670
just been grand looked around and he
said who I admire you know and you want

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.480
to be admired himself and he said you
know why do i buy these other people and

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.000
he said if I admire them for these
reasons maybe other people will admire

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.810
me if I behave in a similar manner any
and he decided what kind of a person who

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:14.240
wanted to be and if you follow that at
the end you'll be the person you love my

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.440
ten percent of I mean that's the goal in
the end and it's it's something that's

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.830
achievable by by everybody in this room
so that's the end of the sermon

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.270
knowledge let's talk about what's on
your mind and the you're going to ask

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.020
anything

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.880
the only thing I won't tell you is what
we're buying or selling her about let's

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.820
say yeah i don't i don't even tell
myself that I mean I i write it down

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.510
that I like the coca-cola formula you
know there's only two people can get

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.630
into the trust Department and find out
what they are and I don't know the two

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.490
are so it at its we don't talk about
what we're buying or selling but

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.010
anything else is fair game personal
business

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.820
anything you'd like to talk about and
actually the top of the questions are

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.840
the more interesting of this for me so
don't don't spare my feelings i may just

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.150
thrown at my head

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.200
add that and with that let's I guess we
got a microphone is this the only

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.460
microphone is there one on feeling like
ok here is my ceiling

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.740
I'm gonna do microphone to stand in line
them and i'll be Regis Philbin and you

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.460
can

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:20.080
yes i have an old-fashioned belief that
i can only should expect to make money

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.430
and things that I understand when I say
understand I don't understand it

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.790
you know what the product does or
anything like that

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.930
I didn't understand what the economics
of the business are likely to look at

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:38.440
look like 10 years in our 20 years and
now i know in general what the economics

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.470
of a Wrigley chewing gum will look like
10 years now

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.950
the internet is going to change the way
people should come

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.840
it isn't going to change which come they
true now if you own the chewing gum

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.240
market in a big way and you've got
double mint experiment and juicy fruit

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.450
those brands will be there 10 years
analysis

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.230
I can't pinpoint exactly what the
numbers are gonna look like I'm really

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.410
but i'm not going to be way off if I try
to look forward on something like that

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.970
that evaluating that company is within
when i call my circle of competence I

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.230
understand what they do i understand the
economics of and I understand the

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.690
competitive aspects of the business

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:22.930
there can be all kinds of companies that
have wonderful futures but i don't know

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.070
which ones they are

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:31.180
and I given talks in the past where I
carry with me a a 70-page tightly

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:37.750
printed list and it shows two thousand
auto companies now for the start of the

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.670
20th century you had seen what the auto
was going to do to this country the

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:47.170
impact it would have on the lives and
then your children and grandchildren and

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:52.840
so on that what it just it transformed
the American landscape but of those two

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:58.000
thousand companies you know three
basically survive and they haven't done

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.350
that well I had many times

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:06.020
so how do you pick three winners out of
2,000 I mean it's not so easy to do it's

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.140
easy when you look back but it's not so
easy looking forward so you could have

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:15.140
been dead right on on the fact that the
auto industry fact he probably could

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.700
have predicted how big impact it would
have but you wouldn't have if you want

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.120
companies across the board you wouldn't
have made any money because the economic

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.520
characteristics of that business we're
not easy to define i said i'd always

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.780
said the easier thing to do is figure
out who loses and what you really should

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.520
have done in 1900 five or so when you
saw what was going to happen with the

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.270
auto is you should have gone short
horses there were 20 million horses and

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.480
1900 there's about four million horses
now so it's easy to figure out the

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:51.980
losers get the losers the horse but the
winner was the auto overall but 2,000

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.370
companies just about fail with you
merged out and so on

00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:02.120
there were three companies auto
companies in the Dow Industrials in the

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.070
nineteen twenties and thirties
Studebaker Nash Combinator and Hudson

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.780
motor those names are all familiar to me
and maybe some more familiar to you

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.500
but they're not making any cars you know
they didn't make money i had at one time

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.020
they were in the dowel 30

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.610
they were the aristocrats of American
business and they got creamed

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.010
so figuring out the economic
characteristics about the winners in a

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.840
wonderful business and it is not easy in
north carolina in a horrible and Roberto

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.440
golf

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.440
I guess or we'll talk often we're
watching i have been Wilbur

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:43.100
but if you could have seen the future of
the airline business from that point

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.149
forward and how that would transform
things you know it would blow you away

00:16:47.149 --> 00:16:49.670
that's excited people incidentally ever
since

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.450
but if they're going to capitalist the
kitty hawk he should have shot horrible

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.080
down

00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.440
I mean it because it's nothing but cost
investors money there were 400 airplane

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.470
companies in the nineteen twenties and
thirties along there was an all the hall

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.459
there was a Nebraska we were the silicon
valley of America apparently very graft

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:13.010
and they all disappeared in a terrible
business at the end of nineteen

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.809
ninety-one if you added up the aggregate
earnings from all airline companies with

00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:21.589
billions board in since Wilbur and
Orville were down there

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:27.140
they came to less than zero number of
passengers went up every year the

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.309
importance of the industry was
dramatically increased decade by decade

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:34.250
and nobody made any money

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:39.200
it so figuring out the economic
consequences TV

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.610
I think there's I don't know 20 25
million sensei years old the United

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.390
States

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.840
I don't think is one of them made in the
United States anymore I mean it's a TV

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.210
set manufacturer what a wonderful
business site

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.520
everybody and nobody a TV in nineteen
fifty are there about 45 to 50

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.679
everybody has multiple sets now nobody
is in the United States and made any

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:04.700
real money making the sense that they're
all out of business in the magnet boxes

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.170
the rca's all of those companies radio
was the equivalent of 20 over 500

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.440
companies making radios in nineteen
twenties again I don't think there's a

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.400
us radio manufacturer at the present
time but coca-cola

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:21.110
you know I was eighteen eighty for
jacob's pharmacy or whatever and fellow

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:25.910
comes up with something a lot of cock
copiers over the years but now you've

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:32.510
got a company that is selling roughly
1.1 billion a tout servings of its

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.890
product not all cloaks writing some
other daily throughout the world

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:42.950
honoured 17 years later so understanding
the economic characteristics of a

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.330
business is different than predicting
the fact that an interest

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:52.419
is going to do wonderfully so I look at
the internet businesses are looking at

00:18:52.419 --> 00:18:55.899
tech mrs. i say this is a marvelous
thing I love to play around on the

00:18:55.899 --> 00:19:00.190
computer and it now i order my books
from amazon and all kinds of things but

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.460
I don't know who's going to win unless I
know who's going to win

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.640
I'm not interested in the best thing
i'll just play around on the computer at

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:14.110
defining your circle of competence is
the most important aspect of investing

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:18.880
it's not how important how large your
circle is you don't have to be an expert

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.260
on everything but knowing where the
perimeter of that circle of what you

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:28.149
know what you don't know is and staying
inside of it is all important

00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:33.309
Tom Watson senior started IBM said in
his book he said it

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:36.730
I'm no genius said but I'm smart in
spots

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.090
I stay around those spots and you know
that is the key

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.289
so if I understand a few things and I
stick in that arena

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.940
I'll do okay and if I don't understand
something but I got all excited about it

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.179
because my neighbors are talking about
stocks are going up everything they

00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:53.769
start fooling around someplace else

00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:59.440
eventually I'll get cream and I should
so now let's go over here a little bit

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.720
I got two short questions one is how do
you find intrinsic value in a company

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:11.649
while intrinsic value is what is the
number that if you were all knowing

00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:16.149
about the future and could predict all
the cash that a bit of business would

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:18.490
give you between now and judgement day

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:24.490
discounted at the proper discount rate
that number is what the intrinsic value

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.080
of businesses in other words the only
reason for making investment laying out

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.350
money now is to get more money later on
right that's that's what investing is

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.159
all about

00:20:33.159 --> 00:20:37.630
now when you look at the stock when you
look at the bottom so Miss United States

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.909
government is very easy tom what you're
going to get back

00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:43.240
it says it right on the bond it says
when you get the interest payments so

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.529
when you get the principal

00:20:44.529 --> 00:20:48.460
so it's very easy to figure out the
value of a body could change tomorrow of

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:54.220
interest rates change but you are the
cash flows are printed on the bond the

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.740
cash flows are printed on a stock
certificate

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.169
that's the job of the animals

00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:03.330
is to print out change that stock
certificate which represents an interest

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.619
in the business and change that into a
bond and say this is what I think it's

00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:13.950
going to play out in the future when we
buy you know some machine for Shaw it to

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.820
make carpet

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.100
that's what we're thinking about
obviously and you know you all learned

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.029
that in business school but it's the
same thing for a big business it if you

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:25.769
by coca-cola today the company is
selling for about a hundred and ten to

00:21:25.769 --> 00:21:29.399
fifteen billion dollars in the market
the question is if you had a hundred and

00:21:29.399 --> 00:21:33.629
ten or fifteen billion you would be
listening to me but I didn't listen to

00:21:33.629 --> 00:21:39.989
you it's nothing but the question is
would you lay it out today to get what

00:21:39.989 --> 00:21:43.769
the coca-cola company is going to
deliver to you over the next two or

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:44.730
three hundred years

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.669
discount rate doesn't make much
difference after as you get further out

00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:51.299
but and that is a question how much cash
they are going to give you it isn't a

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:54.690
question of you know that is the
question of how many analysts are going

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.049
to recommend that or what the volume of
the stock is or what the chart looks

00:21:58.049 --> 00:21:58.889
like running

00:21:58.889 --> 00:22:01.919
it's a question how much cash is going
to give you that you only read the true

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:03.389
with if you're buying a farm

00:22:03.389 --> 00:22:07.950
- if you're buying an apartment house
any financial asset for oil in the

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:08.789
ground

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:12.269
you're laying out Cashin how to get your
cash back later on and the question is

00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:16.980
how much you're going to get one here to
get it and how sure are you

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:23.580
and when i calculate intrinsic value of
a business when we buy businesses and

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.429
whether we're buying all of a business
or a little piece of the business i

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:29.249
always think we're buying the whole
business because that's my approach to

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:29.820
it

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:36.419
I look at it and say what what will come
out of this business and when and what

00:22:36.419 --> 00:22:40.350
you really like of course of them to be
able to use the money they earn and are

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.889
higher returns on it as you go along I
mean Berkshires never distributed

00:22:43.889 --> 00:22:48.629
anything to shareholders but its ability
to distribute goes up as the value of

00:22:48.629 --> 00:22:53.249
the businesses we own increases we can
compound it internally but the real

00:22:53.249 --> 00:22:53.929
question

00:22:53.929 --> 00:23:01.340
berkshire selling for will say a hundred
and five or so billion now uh what can

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.940
we distribute from that hundred and if
you're going to buy the whole company

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:11.960
405 million now can we distribute enough
cash to you soon enough to make a

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.679
sensible

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:16.610
at present interest rates to lay out
that cash now and that's that's what he

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.190
gets out doing at the end if you can't
answer that question

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.960
you can't buy the stock you know you can
gamble in the stock if you want to your

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.080
neighbors can buy it but if you don't
answer that question I can't answer that

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.279
for for internet companies for example
that a lot of companies that all kinds

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:34.999
of me so I can ask for but I just stay
away from those number two

00:23:34.999 --> 00:23:38.240
so you get formula is involved in
finding intrinsic values and

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.230
circumference and you got a mathematical
this is that just got a present value of

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:49.249
future cash show segments for question
is why haven't you written down your set

00:23:49.249 --> 00:23:53.629
of formulas or your strategies in
written form so you can share with

00:23:53.629 --> 00:23:54.470
everyone else

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.499
well i think i actually have written
about that oh and if you read the annual

00:23:57.499 --> 00:24:00.919
reports over the years back the most
recent and report

00:24:00.919 --> 00:24:05.840
I i use what I've just been talking to
use the illustration of Esau because

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:12.080
here he stopped was in 600 BC smart man
was smart enough to know it was 600 BC

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:18.379
though I mean it will take a little
foresight that but he stopped you know

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:21.529
it between tortoises and hair is always
other things he found time to write

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:25.639
about you know Bert and he said a bird
in the hand is worth two in the bush

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.820
now there isn't quite complete because
the question is how sure are you that

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.139
there are two in the bush

00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:36.169
and how long you have to wait to get
them out now

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:39.929
they probably knew that but he just
didn't have time because he had all

00:24:39.929 --> 00:24:44.879
these other problems to write and had to
get on with it so but he was halfway

00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:50.460
there and 600 BC that's all there is to
investing is how many birds in the bush

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.299
what are you going to get them out and
how sure are you

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:59.850
now if interest rates are fifteen
percent roughly

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.090
you've got to get two birds out of the
bush and five years equal the bird in

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.860
the hand but if interest rates are three
percent and you can get two birds out in

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.629
20 years it still makes sense to give up
the bird in the hand because it's all

00:25:12.629 --> 00:25:17.399
gets back to discounting against an
interest on interest rate that Hamish

00:25:17.399 --> 00:25:21.720
often you don't know you know not only
how many birds in the bush put in the

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.720
case the Internet companies there
weren't any birds in the bush but that

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.320
but they still take the bird that you
give them from the hand that but it's

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.549
but I i actually have written about this
sort of thing and stealing have away

00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:38.440
from the top of the rotor some 2,600
years ago but I've been behind on my

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:38.860
reading

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:43.539
yeah yeah good morning huh I know you're
vain for your success but i was curious

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:48.490
is there any particular moments in your
life that or mistakes or failures that

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.649
you've made that were particularly
memorable

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:53.529
what you may have learned from them and
if you have any particular advice for

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:59.620
the students here in dealing with the
with the discouraging circle yeah I well

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.559
I may have made a lot of mistakes
biggest mistake i exalt while and not

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:06.039
the biggest not necessarily the biggest
but the by Berkshire Hathaway itself was

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:10.450
a mistake because virtually lousy
textile business and I brought a very

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.679
cheap

00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:16.750
I've been taught by Ben Graham to buy
things on a quantitative basis look

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:23.590
around for things that are cheap and
that i was taught that same 1949-50 made

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:29.139
a big impression on me so I went around
looking for what i call you cigar bunch

00:26:29.139 --> 00:26:33.789
of stocks and the cigar butt approach to
buying stocks is that you walk down the

00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:37.120
street and you're looking around for
cigar butts and you find this

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:43.149
honestly that's terrible-looking soggy
ugly-looking cigar one pot left in it

00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:47.409
but you pick it up and you get your one
puff disgusting is right away but it's

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:47.980
free

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.190
I mean it's cheap and then you look
around for another soggy

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.279
you know one puff cigarettes well that's
what I did for years

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:59.259
it's a mistake ah although we make money
doing it but you can't make it with big

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:02.740
money so much easier just to by
wonderful businesses so now i would

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.340
rather buy a wonderful business at a
fair price that a fair business with a

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.570
wonderful price but in those days I was
buying cheap stocks and berkshire was

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.570
selling below its working capital for
sure you have plans for nothing at the

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:14.710
machinery for nothing

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.539
you get the inventory and receivables of
the discount is cheap so i bought it and

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:24.610
twenty years later I was still running a
lousy business and that money did not

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.090
compound you really want to be a
wonderful business because at that time

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:31.690
is the friend of the wonderful business
you keep compounding it keeps doing more

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:36.940
business and you keep making more money
time is the enemy of the lousy business

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.600
I could have sold berkshire perhaps
liquidated it and made a quick little

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.529
profit

00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:46.149
you know one puff but staying with those
kind of businesses is this is a big

00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.929
mistake

00:27:46.929 --> 00:27:51.399
so you might say I learned something out
of that mistake and I would have been

00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:55.809
way better off taking what i did with
Berkshires I kept buying but better

00:27:55.809 --> 00:27:56.590
businesses

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.220
I started insurance business sees candy
the Buffalo and all kinds of things i

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.840
would have been way better doing that
with a with a brand-new little entity

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.409
that I'd set up rather than using
berkshire the platform now I've had a

00:28:08.409 --> 00:28:09.519
lot of fun out of it

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:12.669
I mean everything in life seems to turn
out for the better so I I don't have any

00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:15.490
complaints about that but it was a dumb
thing to do

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:20.649
I went in the US air i bought a
preferred stock in 1989

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:26.379
ah as soon as my check cleared the
company went into the red never got out

00:28:26.379 --> 00:28:28.450
I mean it was it that really done

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:33.250
I mean a dead I've got an 800 number i
call now whenever I think about buying

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.240
an airline stock i call them up any our
that fortunately i call it three in the

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.779
morning and I just dial it myself my
name is Warren I'm a narrow holic and

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:44.019
I'm thinking about buying this thing and
then they talked me down many things

00:28:44.019 --> 00:28:44.590
happened

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.740
thanks takes hours sometimes but it's
worth it

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.520
flipping if you ever think about that
era of buying an airline stock call me

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.750
and i'll give you the 800 number because
I don't know

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:59.930
you don't want to do it but we got lucky
in terms of how we eventually came out

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.410
on it but it was a dumb dumb decision

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:06.590
all mine and I've done

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:12.320
I biggest biggest step in terms of
events that in terms of opportunity

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.520
cause eventually cost

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.530
I brought half interest in a Sinclair
filling station was about 20 with a guy

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.920
was in the national guard with out of my
ten thousand dollars then I put two

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.530
thousand dollars in and I lost it all

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:29.210
so that was twenty percent and that
means that the opportunity cost is now

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.950
six billion dollars of that of that
filling station which is a big price to

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:37.430
pay for you know getting the white with
your windows in the fields Hannah

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.830
windshields and things like that so

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.530
actually I like it when berkshire goes
down does it reduce the cost of that

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:49.820
mistake on an opportunity to us but the
biggest mistakes we made by far I've

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:56.060
made not we've made the biggest mistakes
I've made by far our mistakes of

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:01.400
omission and not coalition me it's the
things I knew enough to do they were

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.620
within my circle of competence and I was
sucking my thumb and that is really

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.550
those are the ones that her they don't
show up any place I probably cost

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:14.960
berkshire at least five billion dollars
for example by sucking my thumb

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.670
twenty years ago are close to one Fannie
Mae was was having some troubles and

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:24.740
forget about the whole company for
practically nothing and I don't worry

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.890
about that if it's microsoft because I
don't know what was microsoft isn't in

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.030
my circle of compliments

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.900
that's why I I don't have any reason to
think I'm entitled to make money out of

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.550
Microsoft or out of cocoa beans or
whatever but I didn't know enough to

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:41.570
understand Fannie Mae and I bullet and
that never shows up under conventional

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:46.730
county but the call i know the cost of
it I know I know you know that I passed

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:47.240
it up

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.690
and those are the big big mistakes and

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:56.360
I've had plenty of them at and you
unless I tell you about them in the

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:01.250
annual report and I resist the
temptation sometimes as I tell you about

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.510
him in the annual report

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.250
you're not going to know it because it
doesn't show up under conventional

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:09.200
county but automation is way bigger than
accomplished there is a big

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.120
opportunities in life have to be seized
out we don't do very many things but

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.700
when we get the chance to do something
that's right a big

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.900
we've got to do it and even to do it on
a small scale is just as big a mistake

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.350
almost is not doing it at all I mean
you've really gotta you gotta grab them

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:28.460
when they come and that because they are
not going to get 500 great opportunities

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.910
you would be better off if when you got
out of school here

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:37.250
you gotta punch card with 20 punches on
it and every big financial every

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.510
financial decision you made you used up
a punch you get very rich because you

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.520
think through very hard

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.580
each one of you want to a cocktail party
and somebody talk about a company didn't

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.670
even understand what they did he
couldn't pronounce the name but they

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.100
made some money last week and another
one like it

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.220
you wouldn't buy it if you only had 24
inches on that card there's a temptation

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.870
to dabble

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:02.810
if particularly during all markets in
socks is so easy you know easier now

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.700
than ever because you can do it online

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.970
you know just you click it then and
maybe goes up to . get excited about

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.920
that you buy another one the next day
and so on

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.820
you can't make any money over time doing
that but if you have a punch card with

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.140
only 20 punches

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.440
we're going to get another one of us to
your life you would think a long time

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.090
before every investment decision and you
would make good ones and you make big

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:27.710
ones and you probably wouldn't even use
all 20 punches at the in your lifetime

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:28.760
but you would need to

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:34.070
yeah mr. perfect morning and in your
comments about making mistakes and

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.190
errors like that you talk a little about
your self discipline when you're in a

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:41.450
position and you you feel like it's no
longer good in what criteria to use to

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.070
you just finally abandoned it

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:47.300
yeah when I started out the South
situation has changed over the years

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:53.870
because when i started out and why ideas
the money and i would go through movies

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.870
manual i went through it page by page
and then I went through it again

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.640
by page and i found stocks in there that
i could understand that we're selling a

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.160
bike to time journeys even one time
servings

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.030
well when you don't have 10,000 bucks
that i can get a little frustrating and

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.350
and if you don't like to borrow money
which I never like to borrow money so I

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.860
was always coming up with more ideas
than i had money so i had to sell

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.510
whatever I likes least to buy something
new that just was compelling to me and

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:25.970
it for a long time i was in that mode
and now our problems we have more money

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.530
than ideas

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.530
so where when

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.480
if you look at our annual report which
is on the internet under in our home

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.040
base furniture out of the way . com

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.540
you'll see something in the back call
the economic principles of Berkshire and

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.830
you will see which I believe in setting
out for my my partner's they are my

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.160
partner's I don't look at my share of my
partners and I got my partners for life

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:54.350
so I want to tell them how I think and
if they don't just agree with the way I

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:58.100
think that's fine but I don't want them
that I don't be disappointed in me

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:03.890
so ah i lay out there and I say in terms
of are wholly owned businesses

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.250
we're not going to sell no matter how
much anybody offers this for me I mean

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.389
if somebody offers three times what
something is worth that sees candy the

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.480
buffalo news for showers whatever maybe
we're not gonna sell it

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.440
I may be wrong and having that approach
i know i'm not wrong with my own

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.230
daughter percent of aperture because
that's the way I want to live my life

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.629
I've got all the money could possibly
need

00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:28.429
you know just amounts to which a change
in the newspaper story on my obituary

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:32.629
and the amount of money the foundation
has and the break off relationships with

00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:36.620
people i like and people that have
joined me because they think it's a

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.830
permanent home to do that simply because
somebody waits a big check at me would

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.950
be like something for my children
because up to a big shot

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:46.340
I won't do that and I want to tell my
partner's I won't do it so that they're

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:51.409
not disappointed me more and more with
certain stocks

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:56.990
we've got that approach now if we were
chronically short of funds and all kinds

00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:00.980
of opportunities coming we might have a
somewhat different approach but our

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.400
inclination is not the cell things
unless

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.079
we get really discouraged perhaps with
the management or we think the economic

00:35:09.079 --> 00:35:11.599
characteristics of the business change
in a big way

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:14.809
I mean and that happens so what I'm
going to sell simply because it looks

00:35:14.809 --> 00:35:15.589
too high

00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:19.730
yep in all likelihood that mean that I
can't make that a hundred percent but

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.960
it's it's

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:26.119
that's that's that's the principle under
which we operate we're generating right

00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:27.230
now

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:32.569
five billion of cashier at least so it's
a hundred million bucks every week and

00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:33.740
you know just met

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:40.579
we've been talking about half an hour
and i'm not a damn thing so since you

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:44.450
know I think the real question is how do
you put it out intelligent by the ad and

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.930
if we were selling things would be just
that much more so they make their money

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:52.970
there may come a time when that would
change but what we want to and I have

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.930
partners

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:58.069
Cheryl were partners who would say if
you can get three times what sees

00:35:58.069 --> 00:36:01.760
candies worth why don't you sell it and
that's why I want to be sure before they

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.599
come in they know how I think on that I
mean they're they're entitled to know

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:09.950
that that you really want to thank for
meta you know if you're going to get

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:14.779
married and you want to mary's that's
going to last

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.750
initially the happiest married you know
or one that that Martha Stewart will

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.990
talk about anything that you want a
marriage is gonna last

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:29.960
what quality you look for in a spouse
one quality good for brains

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:34.789
you look for humor you look for
character to look for beauty

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:40.970
now you look for low expectations that

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.190
that is the marriage is gonna watch them

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:50.880
both have low expectations i made it and
I want my partners to be on the low side

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.210
on expectations coming in because i want
the marriage classes the financial

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:58.470
marriage when I join me at virtual and I
don't want him to think i'm going to do

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:03.630
things that I'm i'm not going to do so
that's that's our guiding principle

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.230
the device is all free in your medical
advice everything

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:13.790
next time good morning it mr. Babbitt I
have a question regarding evaluation of

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:19.640
the sounds of investment in recent years
appears that the use of tax sheltering

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.200
in preparation is increasing and such
you know reputable companies like UPS

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:32.120
and others involved in a cold part of
silver shoulders with IRS and as we know

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:37.490
most of these transactions are very
artificial but yet there is the profit

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:42.530
there from the investor perspective do
you think it's beneficial for investor

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.670
that the company that they invest a
involved no see

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:53.030
charters and if so do you think would be
helpful is it built in such that

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:56.330
disclosed in statements and immediately

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:03.020
no statement not sure I got that a
hundred percent George to you that i

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.490
will repeat that it and they are all the
Giants shot at it

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:13.700
they if you think that the involvement
of a corporation that you invest or

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.980
anybody for that matter invest in tax
shelter which is by some definition of

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.810
that attack showers right

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:26.150
I've never used one yeah i know i wanna
go out to it saying so I'm asking if you

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:31.850
know that the corporation is involved in
such activity that is beneficial in

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.680
charts pattern would you would think
that that's helpful for investments

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:42.050
what does that mean there there's but
they're perfectly legal ways to show

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:48.200
their taxes i mean we we did and still
do but we were the earliest ones to go

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.820
in for low income tax housing credits
that guy met with President first

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.280
president Bush about about that one and
that benefits are still mild degree it

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.020
it's not a big element of virtue of its
a penis and in terms of pictures overall

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:10.130
value but it it is a congressionally
ordained tax benefit

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.970
I wouldn't call exactly a shelter it's a
tax benefit that Congress has decided

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.110
they're willing to offer business

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.160
those and they that because they think
it's the best way to to generate

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.230
low-income housing so we participate in
something but that it's not a it's not a

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:31.140
big factor and and what we do and what I
want there's no there's nothing wrong

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.600
with that then if you get into tax
evasion I mean that's a whole different

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.430
game that point they'll go to jail

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:43.380
no but certain businesses some insurance
companies are incorporated in Bermuda

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:48.000
I that and add you can save a lot of
taxes you have to meet certain other

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.610
tests which we wouldn't want to meet

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.240
but if we were willing to meet those
other tests

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.490
there's nothing illegal or immoral about
us moving to Bermuda we're not going to

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:05.820
do it and what if if the restrictions
were done it that the tax code is the

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.830
rule book and you follow the rule but I
think some of the things people do in

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:16.050
terms of bending that rule book get very
close to frog and sometimes cross the

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:21.570
line into fraud and when they do I think
that would be be prosecuted but that's

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:26.430
that's another game and inside there has
been more pushing on that i would say in

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:31.920
the last five years and certainly was my
experience earlier and there are more

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.390
there's up I think now is diminished the
last year too but a couple years ago

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:41.850
there was very aggressive marketing by
some of the auditing firms and of these

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.320
even with sure

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.900
percentage shares of the gain to be paid
to the others i think that those things

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.280
got fairly dubious and pretty when they
shopped for legal opinions and also that

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.700
if you got caught doing these things you
can say well I was rely on this legal

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:03.990
opinion and therefore I shouldn't go to
jail but just pay the back taxes so I i

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.470
don't know how many anything were
associated with it has done that but

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.710
I've obviously if they push too far we
don't want to be there

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:18.810
yep i was curious with the large number
of people you have now have with the

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.630
tremendous amounts of wealth what do you
think of the current state of

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.620
philanthropy

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.130
well

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:29.350
I'll be out this week and then actually
10 : out flying on to Seattle and then

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.800
and talking to the United Way group out
there they see how well you hide away

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.570
raises more per capita I believe in it
either way in the country and and bill

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:41.890
gates will be there were talking jointly
his mother was very active and the

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:47.770
united way but bill is going to give
away over a billion dollars a year and a

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:51.160
lot more later on but right now a
billion and it's very interesting and

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.200
he's very rational about it and he's
very informed in fact he got somebody I

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.460
think is primary advisor in the medical
field as fellows with the CDC in Vienna

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:05.680
and bill reads 15 books so a month on
this i mean he is thinking just

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.700
absorbing I i wouldn't be able to get it
that fast but he just says with a

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.550
billion dollars he wants to save as many
lives for years you can

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:16.780
so how did he get that his objective
he's it's just as much a metric of his

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.190
of his foundation as some other metric
return on capital might be for a

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.670
business and he says I'm going to spend
a billion dollars or how many how many

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.760
lives can be saved for that so he's
gotten very heavily in the vaccines and

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:36.490
and AIDS in Africa number of things that
it's very rational i personally I think

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:44.830
I've all my 99 . something percent of my
net worth will go to a foundation after

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:49.870
the ladder of my wife and i and i am
it's all going to go to foundation far

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.270
as i'm concerned i got from society's
gonna go to society

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:56.890
I've written a letter to my trustees
I've got very few trustees to get a

00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:01.060
whole bunch of trustees in my view it
they just homogenized themselves down to

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.020
sort of the lowest common denominator
because he had 30 people in a room and

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.370
prestigious people but they're also all
have their particular all modern allow

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:13.180
other particular Hospital and it will
become a big trade-off game you know

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.650
that they like Congress so

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:20.450
I have very few people and I don't give
them anything specific because I tell

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:24.170
them their judgment above ground will be
better than my instructions from six

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:27.470
feet underground son that I don't like
to think that but it's true

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:36.350
so I tell him I look the society are the
ones that don't have an actual funding

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:41.180
constituents see you love or are just
damned intractable and very difficult to

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:41.810
solve

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:45.470
so I don't I am NOT going to haunt them
at all

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:50.240
if they spend big money on some terribly
important problem and they fail because

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.070
they're taking on tough problems when I
by businesses i'm buying easy businesses

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:59.420
the reason that big problems of society
or big problems is that their damn tough

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.570
to solve so they're they're swinging at
bad pitches

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.970
I'm swinging it easy pictures in
business but they're swinging it they

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:08.690
have to swing at bad pitches but i tell
him i wanted to try and do it and if

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.690
they fail it doesn't bother me at all
and I tell them if they give a million

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.450
bucks here and a million bucks there in
a million bucks there

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.970
they're not going to sleep because I'm
gonna be haunting him I'm going to come

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:21.560
back every night you know I did not want
the eyedropper approach used to flying

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.250
through p

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:27.620
but I want them to use their judgment to
look at important problems that do not

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.660
have a natural funding constituency

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.450
you know if the government's going to
find it fine you know I mean they should

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.480
be funding important problems but we
don't need to do it

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.110
the the ball applied to be in my I have
in my opinion is the fun things that

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:43.250
don't have the natural constituents and
that's what bills doing there isn't the

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:48.710
neck there are a bunch of people around
that you can make an emotional appeal to

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:55.040
to make vaccines available to millions
and millions of kids around the world it

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.430
just doesn't target anybody's heart
strange you can make buildings after

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:03.170
mean it just isn't the sort of thing
that you can raise money for on an

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.170
emotional basis and there's nothing
wrong with raising money on our

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:10.820
emotional basis but that is a problem
will get solved by a funny constituent

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.540
it was responding to that but bill is
responding to what it is

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.410
mind is that is the important thing
which is saving lives and he doesn't

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:21.710
care whether it gets his name on a
building or whether anything happens or

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.590
what everybody knows about it and he
gets published they just because of the

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.150
scale is on but it

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:30.650
he doesn't care about that i can promise
you that so that's my philosophy is that

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:37.850
I got this money not because i'm a
superior human being not because I've

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:40.100
done more for society and other people

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:47.600
I was wired the right way to be dropped
into the United States at this

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.650
particular time

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.550
I mean it's a huge capitalistic society
and I'm wired

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:57.440
no credit to me but it born that way so
that I'm better an asset allocation than

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.030
other people to some degree

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.750
just like other people are better at all
kinds of other things and I was with two

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.340
teachers out of the sun valley

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.460
they're doing more for society that I am
and they don't

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.240
this market system does nothing for them
market system does all kinds of things

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.140
for me

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.770
kate says if I have been born five
thousand years ago you know I have been

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:16.970
some animals lunch

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:18.800
you know because i can't run very fast

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.610
climb trees I mean you know what those
state and I could I could tell that

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.850
animal is chasing me in a way that we
see how I can allocate assets you know

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:29.030
it wouldn't make any difference

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:34.760
so here I am yeah i'm bored out again I
the just very very lucky and at the odds

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.060
when i was born in nineteen thirty the
odds with 50 to 1 against baby born the

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.900
United States

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.710
that's a terrible set onto the face and
then I was rock down here you know and

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:46.370
if I then drop down and / or someplace
ER or China

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:51.140
I mean I wouldn't have a chance so
society is what does it for you and and

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.860
it should go back and might be with you
go back to society if you've been lucky

00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:01.010
enough to be dropped into a society
where your particular wiring pays off

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.880
big

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.980
now it that that's just luck and and you
know there's nothing wrong with being

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:10.790
like I don't feel guilty about anything
else but i also don't feel that I feel

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.450
like I have a lot of fun doing what I do
but I feel the money should go back into

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:20.120
society and it should go back as
intelligently as it can and best way to

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:24.350
do it intelligently is to have high
grade and intelligent people

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:29.600
administering it at the time and you
don't know the problems that are going

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.690
to be out there 10 years from now or 20
years from now or 30 years from now but

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:39.260
i do know if I've got a small number of
high-grade smart people and high grade

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.310
is more applied out

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:45.350
Oh of if you gave me 20 extra points of
IQ but but cheated a little on the high

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:49.010
grade I wouldn't take it because that
they got to be they got to be there's

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:55.610
somebody chances that to do things in a
petty way or you know do try to make

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.790
people get supported in their own minds
to their own interests rather than the

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:02.270
interest of the institution so I really
want super high-grade people doing it

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:07.340
and I've got them and I think the money
might do a lot of good it may do no good

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:12.680
but it will be operating in fields or if
it doesn't good that good probably would

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.410
have been done otherwise

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.250
yep

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:22.320
I'm just wondering there's a lot of
differences between the recent boom and

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.370
bust the stock market and one in the
nineteen twenties but there's also a lot

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:30.750
of similarities and the simulators are
allowing people to draw the conclusion

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:35.130
that stock prices will be trapped
depressed for some time to come

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:40.410
what where do you disagree agree with
that we bought in the the whole century

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:46.470
is quite interesting if you take the
20th century it was unbelievable century

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:50.970
for the United States the gdp per capita
and that's the way to think of this per

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.840
capita sometimes they talk about our gdp
vs Europe's but if their populations the

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.470
same every year an artist goes up one
percent you've gotta you know in the end

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:03.780
of the goods you gotta i have a divisor
as well as the numerator and and so gdp

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.890
per capita in the 20th century in the
United States one of six hundred and ten

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:12.870
percent actually qualitatively went too
far more than that because you can't

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:16.800
really measure you know certain things
and medicine or whatever it may be it

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.680
and the improvements but just out of
quantitative basis

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.070
it went up every single decade including
the decade of the thirties

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:31.110
so here you have a hundred years when
basically the US citizen really was

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:35.940
getting was improving their lot decade
by decade by decade the thirties

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:41.670
it was a 13-percent that's decade was
World War 2 the night the forties

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:46.410
36-percent the worst decade was the
first world war so you get sometimes the

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:49.620
analogy I can get in trouble and
analogies but any of that it was it was

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:57.360
a huge . interestingly enough there were
six big periods in there for the stock

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.760
market in both directions

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.870
there were three big bull market from
1910 1920 one

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:10.110
the Dow want from 66 to 70 one less than
a 10-percent move in 20 years

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:14.730
less than half a percent here you got
evidence to put a half of it didn't move

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:18.360
from 21 to 29 as you point out at what

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.930
it went from 71 to a high of 381 in
September

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:25.200
of 1929 while five hundred percent

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.410
well obviously the country well being of
the country thing about five hundred

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:31.200
percent during that period and the
well-being of the company in the country

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.430
about the whole lot more than ten
percent during that first 21 years so he

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:40.710
had this very uneven development from 19
from september's 1929 until the end of

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:47.640
1948 the download from 381 to about a
hundred and eighty was cut in half and

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.890
that was eighteen long years and yet the
per capita gdp was moving right up

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:57.839
during this whole period to the economy
is doing fine for 38 265 the doll one

00:50:57.839 --> 00:51:02.940
again from about a hundred eighty up to
close to a thousand again 541 which was

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:09.630
far outstripping from 65 to 80 1 the
doll went down literally

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:13.829
well again per capita to be and then
we've had this last period where it's

00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:17.760
going to prolifically if you take the
whole hundred years it went up a hundred

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.819
and eighty-four one every thousand
dollars became a hundred eighty thousand

00:51:20.819 --> 00:51:24.569
but forty three and a quarter you're
forty three and three-quarters years

00:51:24.569 --> 00:51:30.299
with those three big huge bull markets
and fifty six and a quarter years with

00:51:30.299 --> 00:51:34.349
periods of stagnation all in an economy
that was doing fine

00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:38.520
you know year after year after your
fifty six and a quarter years

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.089
net the dow was down a couple other
points during that period and the other

00:51:42.089 --> 00:51:46.109
forty three and three-quarters years
made up the rest of this move from 66 to

00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:52.380
11,000 someone to dallas self-excited
yourself how could it be that you can

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.549
have a country was doing better and
better and better and better citizens

00:51:56.549 --> 00:52:00.540
we're living every every generation was
living better than the one that preceded

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:00.930
it

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:06.180
but you have these huge changes big
gains a few times long period of

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:10.020
stagnation 20 years I mean that's a long
time to do nothing

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:15.930
the answer is that investors behave in
very human ways which is they get very

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:20.160
excited during bull markets and they
look in the rearview mirror and they say

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.930
I made money last year

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:25.349
i'm going to make more money this year
so this time I'll borrow an hour or the

00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:29.400
neighbor says you know I wasn't it last
year when that neighbor was dumber than

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.309
I am a lot of money so i'm going to go
in this year's they're always looking at

00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.880
the river

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.910
where and when they look in the rearview
mirror and they see a lot of money

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.870
having been made in the last few years
they plow and they just push and push

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:43.620
and push on prices and when they look in
the rearview mirror and I see no money

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.790
having been made

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:49.050
they just say this is a lousy place to
be so they don't care what's going on in

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.470
the underlying business and it's it's
astounding but that's that makes for a

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.860
huge opportunity just huge opportunity

00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:00.840
I mean I have lived through roughly half
in investing sense about half that . and

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.190
I've had that long period of stagnation
from 48

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:10.770
I mean from 65 to 80 - 17 years

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.610
I wrote an article for forbes in 1979 I
just how can this be

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.960
pension funds in the nineteen seventy
put a hundred and some percent of their

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.530
new money in stock because they were
wild about stocks then they got a lot

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:27.000
cheaper and they put our record low in
nine percent of that nobody in the 1970s

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.640
when stocks for way cheaper people
behave very peculiarly and and in terms

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.540
of the reactions because they they're
human beings and they get excited when

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.540
others get excited they get greedy when
others get greedy they get fearful one

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:44.250
other get fearful and they'll continue
to do so and you will see you know if

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:49.140
you will see things you won't believe in
your lifetime and securities markets and

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:54.660
the country will do very well over time
but you will see these huge waves and

00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:01.860
then and if you can stay objective
throughout that you can detach yourself

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.410
temperamentally from the crowd

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:08.100
you get very rich and you won't have to
be very bright

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.830
I mean it I'm sure you are but but

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:14.070
that one you know it just it doesn't
take brains it takes temperament

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:19.290
it takes the ability to sit there and
look at something when i started out in

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.500
nineteen fifty i would go through and
find things at two times earnings and

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.140
they were perfectly decent businesses
and people want two jobs at those

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.650
companies and everybody knew they were
going to be around anyone behind with

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:30.690
two times earnings and that's when
interest rates for two and a half

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:37.170
percent you know I went to the start
installing security lights 21 and I

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:40.350
Kansas City Life Insurance Company have
to be a fairly prominent company in

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:46.140
omaha and the policies they sold google
if you're buying life in church from

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:51.120
them had a building and assumption of
two percent interest the stock of kansas

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.370
city life was selling it

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:57.180
less than three times earnings you're
getting 35% if you bought the stock

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:01.860
no question about the sound of the
company I went to the local agent as I

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.770
figure it out I'll give yourself him a
few shares of stock I mean think I

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.950
understand he's got his whole life
invested in this company with the local

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:08.640
agent

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:14.130
we've been with them for 20 years and as
name is mo size of mr. moose and you

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:17.430
know you're selling these policies with
2% even have a few members of your own

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:21.390
family and you can buy into this company
whose paycheck youtube and on every

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.990
month that you know and whose future you
of your your beneficiaries of his life

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:28.830
policy depend on and who you're selling
them you know a two percent investment

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:33.510
on and you get thirty five percent of
your money you know and i'm stuck trying

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:36.990
to be good and then I couldn't I
consultant and I'm i will allow

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.950
themselves when I mean the world you
have to start with that but but it just

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:41.970
blew me away

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:45.120
it blew me away I thought sometimes I
used to wonder if I his nuts you know

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:51.030
that that but those things the same
thing happened I mean 1964 the dow

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.960
closed the dates

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:59.760
864 and then a 1981 17 years later later
it closed at age 65 and move one . in 17

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:06.630
years now it's not a big move and that
you can't believe the how discouraged

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:11.700
people were by that by the during that
period but you know people are looking

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.710
better

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.740
so things can go on a long time

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:21.680
that don't make sense and but they don't
come to an end i mean the internet thing

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.430
I mean you had these companies selling
for many billions of dollars that had

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.880
nope

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.210
really frankly no prospects are making
any money that that's a that's a bubble

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:35.240
butt hurt sign one time said anything
that can't go on forever will end now

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.630
that's a pretty good

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:40.590
but think about that and particularly
think about it next time you're trying

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:44.100
to do something just because the stock's
gone ball a lot you know many of your

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.430
neighbors make money or something that
you've got to be

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:52.170
she's had to sit and think objectively
and think about what i buy this whole

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:52.980
business

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.760
it's an Internet companies got a hundred
million shares outstanding a hundred

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.910
that's ten billion dollars is it worth
ten billion dollars

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:04.260
it's worth ten billion dollars it's got
to be able to give you you know seven or

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:07.590
eight hundred million next year and if
it doesn't give you seven or eight

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.720
hundred million next year he has a good
move

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.750
maybe ten percent more than that the
year after and continue to him

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:18.030
there are a lot of businesses can do
that and people just go crazy and of

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.440
course it's fun

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:24.480
I mean it's you know it's like that sign
they put in doctors offices and says

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.720
avoid hangover state rock and up that
minute

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:32.400
it's just so much fun to keep like but
yeah you got it you got to do sensible

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.350
things to get to get that result

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:38.670
yeah yeah next well we got three people
standing there so let's let's do the

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:39.990
three that are standing ok

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:44.310
good morning sir hi I i was wondering
what your opinion is the Federal Reserve

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:47.910
and their actions taken recently you
feel like done and not to fix the

00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:48.630
economy

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:51.780
yeah well I'm a big fan of alan
greenspan's over time I've known him for

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.700
a long long time we were on a board
together

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:59.430
caption reason Alan is a very very smart
guy he is motivated in my opinion

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:03.600
entirely by whatever for the United
States people united states it

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.240
so you better that you've got you
couldn't have a better person in there

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.570
and the problem

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:15.690
he may have is that that because his
tenure in office has been associated

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:20.280
with this incredible all market that
that even though he wouldn't have

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.120
claimed credit for that people applied
associated because of the importance of

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.630
the Fed generally they might associate
with him so they made if things don't

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.810
work out so well made blame them as well
but I think his policy is generally been

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:31.680
very good

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:37.980
you have to understand one thing that
about the Fed is that it's not as

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.770
powerful as the mystique would make it

00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:45.810
it's a break is better than its gas
pedal when the Fed wants to put on the

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:46.740
brakes

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:50.850
we go for the windshield I mean how do
you know the economy just wrong

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:54.330
yeah and they can put on the brakes Paul
Walker did it

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:59.190
he broke inflation by doing it but I
mean when he put on the brakes and that

00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:03.630
. around nineteen eighty i mean people
hated he was crucified for what is the

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:08.850
right thing to do and he could do it he
did it all by himself and these he and

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:12.150
and it was the only way because of the
momentum the inflation was generating it

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:16.410
was the only thing that was what was
needed then normally unpopular

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:23.970
it's much harder for a Greenspan to put
on the brakes because nobody wants him

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:29.520
to put on the brakes busty so visible
but he's put them on sort of gradually

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:33.420
but stepping on the gas pedal

00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:39.180
he does not necessarily get the same
result it may help but there are a

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.200
thousand other variables operating and
as you see in Japan

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.230
you know you can get down to zero
interest rates and you can stimulate

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:50.580
anything so it isn't like the Japanese
haven't read the same books we read

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:54.240
about economics I mean they've read
canes and they were the whole thing so

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.190
we're not smarter than they are

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:59.609
we don't have any secrets they don't
have but they don't know how to get

00:59:59.609 --> 01:00:03.510
their economy going and you know there

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:07.440
- &lt;operand&gt; two &lt;/operand&gt; GPA has been
going no place you know in the last five

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.300
years and still problems around so easy
money doesn't solve everything but

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:17.910
Greenspan could very well get blamed for
the fact that that he hasn't solved

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:22.350
everything and it's just not in his
power to solve it can help in various

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.890
ways and I've I don't think you could
have anybody but he better and I think

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:29.790
he's done the right thing to this point
but the right thing may not be quite as

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:36.060
as effective as as people may help that
would be in economics as always you

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.500
always want to ask and then what you
read in the paper well what happens if

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.250
the Japanese start selling government
our government bonds or what happened

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.920
they dumped the dollar they can't dump
the dollar

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.760
there's a way to dump dollars you could
you can at least dollar assets because

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.060
the Japanese want to sell government our
government bonds

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:58.870
they sell up to us and they get a time
deposit or a demand deposits it here

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:02.530
they still own a dollar asset if they
sell them to the French they get it and

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:05.140
they may get some answers from the
French but now the French habit I mean

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:11.650
the only way you can reduce foreign
investment in the United States is to

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:15.610
change it around so they're consuming
more than from us more than were

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:20.500
consuming from that might be one once
when we buy a television set from Japan

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.850
if we buy more television sets from them
than they buy equivalent consumables

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:25.660
from us

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:31.180
the exchange of what balances things is
we give them some investment type asset

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.770
whether it's cash or US government bonds
or stocks or movie studios are real

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:40.420
estate or different things and the only
way that reverses is when we start

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:46.660
running a trade surplus which were miles
away from so logically you know if you

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:52.150
read classic economics that you would
believe that our currency would have

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:53.050
been weak along

01:01:53.050 --> 01:02:00.130
Earl weaker over the recent years and
that it would be a week now but there

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:03.040
are other things operating and that's
one of the problems about economics is

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.630
there's never just one variable

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:10.120
there's usually hundreds of variables
and they operate with different impact

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.520
at different times

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.520
I mean it's a it's it's not like a
physics for me if I mean it tho i guess

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.520
it would be if you get in the Heisenberg
principle or something like that but but

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:26.080
the the formula has a lot of the same
variables year after year but the

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.190
relative importance of those variables
and how they interact with each other is

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:33.280
never exactly the same and that's what
we find out the Japanese find out

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.630
everybody finds out and and foreign
currency or the currents are the value

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:42.700
of a dollar and currency rates are
defying what you would expect based on

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:47.470
history but somebody said of history
were perfect guide you know the Forbes

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:50.830
400 would all be librarians you know
she's going to look it up in the books

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:54.310
and it always you know all the answers
but it

01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:57.790
history doesn't repeat itself as Mark
Twain said i was going to repeat itself

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:01.510
but it rhymes I mean things come back
but they don't quite come back in the

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:05.620
same format will understand all this
perfectly for years why the dollars

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.650
behave the way it has but I i think it
would be useful

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:11.650
net from the US if the dollar was strong

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:18.820
yes mr. Buffett thanks for taking my
question my question pertains to small

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:23.410
business and my family spending the
truckload sector of transportation for

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:27.850
about 50 years and as you talked about
the airline industry and other merchants

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:28.510
next week

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:33.580
acquisitions and things going on and a
lot of the smaller players being tossed

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.170
out of the market

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:38.740
what do you see for people that like
this room for students that want to

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:43.090
start a small business and maybe they
want to start in a business that is

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:47.980
somewhat of a commodity type business
but as businesses the large corporations

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:52.390
get larger and their deficiencies
increase how can a small businesses

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:53.680
compete

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.760
it has these people the idea the in many
areas small businesses have an advantage

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.500
you know another businesses scale has a
huge advantage and I mean you don't want

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:09.430
to be a a tiny carbon steel producer on
the other hand when many miles came

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:13.630
along and learn how to use scrap more
effectively that than the the older

01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:19.090
methods of making steel they actually
had managed to scale is a huge advantage

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:20.710
in some businesses

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:25.300
it's you know the largest airlines
haven't won southwest airlines as one

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.270
starting with you know just a few planes
flying down there between houston and

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:33.940
allison and they have become bigger but
their ambition hasn't been to be the

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.200
biggest and you know they they probably
by the fuel of just as cheap as United

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.380
that we bought it you know when there's
lots more walmart is a classic example I

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:45.700
mean who would have thought 25 years ago
30 years ago

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:50.710
i'm here with serious with a hundred
story plus building in Chicago had

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:53.110
access to money far cheaper than sample

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:56.710
I'm Sam was credit was not as good as
serious every supplier wanted to do

01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:00.370
business with sears nobody ever heard of
Sam every real-estate developer was

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:04.430
developing a new shopping center went
first to sears on Sam got

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:09.560
the short end so here's the guys
starting in bentonville arkansas and he

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.910
kills them over time

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:14.990
just playing kills him and disadvantaged
and buying disadvantage and borrowing

01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:17.990
disadvantage in real estate advantage

01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:23.060
Sam Walton and his ability to inspire in
the end hundreds of thousands of people

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.630
to be enthusiastic about going to work
and doing although doing the right

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:31.460
things over time so i would be just as
optimistic about small business

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.590
generally now there's certain areas
where scale just as i was just playing

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:41.930
important but but I see no disadvantage
we intentionally at Berkshire we have a

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:45.980
hundred and twelve thousand employees
more in Georgia than any other state in

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:51.890
the Union incidentally we employ a lot
of their don't and then we put a lot of

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:56.480
people are making a guy go ad we
intentionally with our hundred and

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.320
twelve thousand but we probably have
about how many business units but lots

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.590
at will have 13.8 people at headquarters

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:07.670
I'm not the point agent said that my I
resent it when people like that i have a

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:11.000
full but we have one that works four
days a week then that's all we have at

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.750
headquarters hundred twelve thousand
people a hundred and five billion market

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:21.950
cap but we intentionally keep our units
small we think we want them to have the

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:27.050
nimbleness the responsiveness of the
customer particularly that will turn

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:33.200
them you know that essentially will more
than offset anything that the scale of

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.550
having maybe a little more purchasing
power something when the will develop we

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:41.810
own a home furnishing with furniture
home furnishings business in utah run by

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:46.730
phone bill child he was featured in
Fortune about one issue ago that it did

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:51.260
the cover story was God in business it
was and it was Bill was the number one

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.820
illustration built up that business from
his father-in-law was doing two hundred

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.690
fifty thousand dollars a year and then I
was over half the business in utah in

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:04.040
this field but you're close to 400
million he built by thinking about the

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.310
customer and the truth with he was
competing with sears he was competing

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:12.050
with rabbits was a huge furniture
retailer the retailer in the past he was

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:14.779
competing with everybody but

01:07:14.779 --> 01:07:19.130
all he thought about from the moment he
got up in the morning was how do I take

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:21.380
care of my customer and that wins

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.650
we have a business in Omaha some of you
may have heard of

01:07:25.579 --> 01:07:31.429
it's the largest home furnishing store
in the world in all which only has a SMS

01:07:31.429 --> 01:07:33.529
a of 650,000 people

01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:36.739
it's on 72 acres

01:07:36.739 --> 01:07:42.919
it's does 325 million dollars in one
location which happens to be five

01:07:42.919 --> 01:07:46.099
hundred dollars for every man woman and
child in the SMS a but it draws from

01:07:46.099 --> 01:07:54.859
beyond that that business comes about
her as resulted from an investment of

01:07:54.859 --> 01:08:02.569
five hundred dollars in 1937 by a woman
who walked out of Russia in 1921

01:08:03.199 --> 01:08:09.019
she'll and she walked out . on a peanut
boat landed in seattle with a tag around

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:12.709
her neck she could speak one word of
English the American Red Cross look at

01:08:12.709 --> 01:08:14.599
the tag is at Fort Dodge Iowa

01:08:14.599 --> 01:08:18.440
they got a fort dodge I what she
couldn't pick up the language she was

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.429
there two years

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:22.759
she said she felt like a dummy so she
came to homo because there were other

01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:26.599
Russian Jews there and she's at least
have somebody to talk to her little girl

01:08:26.599 --> 01:08:27.920
started school

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.449
Francis Francis would come home at night
and teach her mother the words you

01:08:32.449 --> 01:08:35.659
learned in school that day that's how
this woman rose bump can learn the

01:08:35.659 --> 01:08:39.259
English language but from her from her
daughter from kindergarten on teaching

01:08:39.259 --> 01:08:44.989
of the words she bought seven siblings
over from Russia one of the time 50

01:08:44.989 --> 01:08:48.739
bucks every time she say fifty bucks she
sold used clothing and the works

01:08:48.739 --> 01:08:54.679
she had her seven siblings over her
mother and father and by 1937 16 years

01:08:54.679 --> 01:08:57.230
after she got here she saved five
hundred dollars

01:08:57.230 --> 01:09:02.119
she got out of train went to Chicago to
the American Furniture Mart which was

01:09:02.119 --> 01:09:03.259
huge

01:09:03.259 --> 01:09:06.980
impressive things you had this - smart
as hell but she fought like a peasant

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.460
away and she saw this building she
decided to name her company then browse

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:14.420
current you want about five hundred
dollars worth of got about two thousand

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.770
dollars worth of you

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:20.600
merchandise all the way back to Omaha
she worried because she thought I old

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.980
$1,500 and she only had a
five-hundred-dollar equity so she got to

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:25.940
Omaha

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.779
she took the bed the sofa

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:34.130
the refrigerator out of her own home to
sell fast

01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:38.240
so she could get the money so she can
pay on time she took that business and

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.100
build it from that start

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.910
no one would sell to her she went to
court four times because they tried to

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:47.450
the carpet manufacturers tried to keep
her from selling the discount and she

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.589
went into court

01:09:48.589 --> 01:09:53.180
add told the judge because you figured
out ways to buy this stuff in various

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:57.350
nefarious ways from other hand of people
by a foreign she said look at i pay

01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:59.180
three dollars a yard for this carpet

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:02.720
brandeis sells it for 698 is I sell it
for 398

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.360
just tell me judge how much you want me
to rob people she defended herself

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.690
papers wrote it up the judge bought
carpet from her the next day I mean it

01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:10.210
was no marvelous

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:14.410
Brandeis is selling anymore they were
the huge department store , she put

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.600
everybody out of business and the punch
line

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.810
she worked till she was a hundred and
three she sold me the business when she

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:24.460
was 89 and she didn't have she didn't
have an audit

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:28.810
I went out this year I want afternoon
took a check out with Nana had because I

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:32.350
knew she wanted to do something and I
said mrs. B here's the money

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:35.500
I said I don't even know what just tell
me where the only money that never open

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.370
any money since I all those guys back in
nineteen thirty-seven and she said it's

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:40.510
all free and clear

01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:44.500
she never seen a balance sheet she
didn't know what accounting terms mad

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.520
but she understood the nature of the
business and i told her i said i'd

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:53.110
rather have I don't have your word and
other than an order from every one of

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:57.130
the big six or bigger or whatever their
word number at the time of the top are

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.550
turning from sin and she worked till she
was a hundred and three

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:05.800
she died a hundred and four she had
three siblings at her funeral

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.700
I mean those are some genes her son
works there now he's eighty two or three

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.920
and the three sisters are all alive but
the punch line is she couldn't read or

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.180
write this woman could not read or write
if you told her this room was sixty

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:25.000
eight feet by 43 she would tell you how
many square yards it was like that she

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.480
ever went to school to be in her life
she would tell you how much that wasn't

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.640
598 yards she had the tax

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.120
she's not about something that she liked
your looks and that would be it

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.250
and that was that you know that is the
that that you can't beat that

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.780
you know had and you can't replicate
that at General Motors you can't

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:49.060
institutionalize that that the person
who brings that kind of drive to a

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:54.280
business and does it day after day and
thinks about the customer

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.230
yeah and that's all she did I can't and
once you've raised four kids in the

01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:03.880
process to but you can't hit it can't
miss and not you don't have to worry if

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.260
you're an entrepreneur in most fields
are some field work

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:11.800
you can't do it because there are some
scale aspects to it but in most fields

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:16.060
you know you will kill people by Sean
that which was shocked

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:19.680
nobody ever heard of Sean carpet 30
years ago and got forty percent of

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.980
the business in the country - so don't I
did

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:27.630
it's a great field of opportunity out
there and i had and i know about

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:31.320
trucking specifically but I wish you the
best on it then your you won't be at a

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.470
disadvantage in many fields if you're
small and you'll actually have an

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:37.470
advantage for thank you

01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:02.670

this possible

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.750
mr. but we have a parting gift for you
but it needs to be placed into context

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:40.199
before we show you what it is in your
most recent letter newsletter - you're

01:13:40.199 --> 01:13:43.800
in a report to the shareholders you
discuss some of the things you look for

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.340
and make with making acquisitions and
one of the things you talked about was

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.290
owners look for owners who care who they
sell to and that was important to you

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:58.050
I like to quote from your report when a
business masterpiece has been created by

01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:02.400
a lifetime or several lifetimes of
understanding care and exceptional

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.330
talent

01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:07.409
it should be important to the owner what
corporation is entrusted to carry on its

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:08.159
history

01:14:08.159 --> 01:14:12.659
a little bit further down you say how
much better it is for the painter of a

01:14:12.659 --> 01:14:16.020
business Rembrandt to personally select
its permanent home

01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:21.000
then they have a trust officer or
uninterested airs knocks it off

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.610
well we believe that many of these words
apply to you as well you two have

01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:31.830
created a business masterpiece you to
have created a Rembrandt what we have

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:37.409

light-hearted characterization that we

01:14:37.409 --> 01:14:40.620
hope to capture some of the business
milestones in your career and we hope

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.739
also captures some of that quick quick
wit and humor that you demonstrated

01:14:43.739 --> 01:14:50.640

ours and a well-known artist lives here

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.350

when

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:27.900
reading your corporate report and this
is going to be a test of that famous

humor but it is a it is intended to be a
porch or both of you and of your company

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:38.580
and of your values and when I was when
Marie garrison my girlfriend

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:42.270
