00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Ghada Khalil Auditor: Ayman Mahmoud 

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:16.125
 I am a capitalist, 

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:20.393
 And 30 years after my work in the capitalist domains, 

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.934
 Which spans 36 companies, 

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.309
 He pumped tens of billions of dollars into the market value, 

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:32.208
 I am not only among the 1% richest, but the 0.1% highest-income. 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.518
 Today, I have come to share with you the secrets of our success, 

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:40.726
 Because wealthy capitalists like me have never been so rich. 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.375
 So the question is, how do we do that? 

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:45.851
 How do we succeed 

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.708
 On the ever-increasing share of the economy each year? 

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:54.792
 Is it because wealthy people today are smarter than they were 30 years ago? 

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.208
 Is it because we are now striving more than we used to? 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 Are we taller and more handsome? 

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.542
 Unfortunately no. 

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:08.143
 The reason is only one thing: 

00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:09.417
 Economy. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.822
 To you the insidious secret. 

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:14.918
 The job of economists was previously 

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:16.518
 Is to work for the public good, 

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.434
 But in the era of modern liberalism, 

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.184
 That is today, 

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.643
 They work only for the interests of large companies 

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.226
 And billionaires. 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.833
 This created a small crisis here. 

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:31.531
 We could have imposed economic policies 

00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.500
 To raise taxes on the wealthy, 

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:38.268
 And control large companies or increase the salaries of workers. 

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:39.809
 We have done this before. 

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.309
 But economists of the modern liberal era warned 

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.351
 Against imposing all of these policies and considered it a fatal mistake, 

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.415
 Because raising taxes always stops economic growth, 

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:52.351
 Also, any form of government oversight 

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.059
 It is ineffective, 

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.458
 And that salary increases always kill jobs. 

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:59.458
 Well, as a result of that thinking, 

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:04.698
 Because in the past 30 years, and only in the United States of America, 

00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:09.059
 Has enriched the richest one percent of $ 21 trillion, 

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:14.518
 While the poorest 50% became poorer with $ 900 billion. 

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:18.434
 A model of increased social inequality that largely repeats itself 

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:19.934
 around the world. 

00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.601
 However, while middle-class families struggle to survive 

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:28.518
 With wages that have not increased for nearly 40 years, 

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:32.684
 Modern liberal economists continue to warn that the only logical solution 

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:36.809
 To counter the troublesome upsets of austerity and globalization 

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.625
 It is more austerity and globalization. 

00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:43.625
 So what should society do? 

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.726
 Well, what we need is very clear to me. 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.957
 We need a new economic order. 

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:55.226
 Economics has been described as a bleak science. 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.351
 And for good reason. Because as much as it is taught today, 

00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:59.976
 He is not aware at all, 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.393
 Despite all the impressive accounts. 

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:06.601
 Indeed, a large number of academics and practitioners have reached out 

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:12.601
 That modern liberal theories of economics are dangerously wrong, 

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.226
 And that the growing crises, due to the high inequality 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.934
 Political instability increases, 

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:23.143
 It is the direct result of decades of corrupt economic theories. 

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:29.143
 And what we do know now is that the economy that made me so rich is not just wrong, 

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.184
 It is also inverted. 

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:33.143
 Because it turned out that 

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.934
 Capital is not what creates economic growth. 

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.208
 But people. 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.798
 And it is not the personal interest that enhances the public interest, 

00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:46.132
 Rather, reciprocity and reciprocity 

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.809
 And that competition is not what leads to our prosperity, 

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:52.458
 Rather, cooperation. 

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:58.351
 What we can see now is that the economy is unfair and not inclusive 

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.768
 It can never achieve high and sustainable levels of social cooperation 

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:05.434
 Necessary to enable contemporary society to thrive. 

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:08.042
 So where did we go wrong? 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.434
 Well, it looks like it's getting pretty clear 

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:19.476
 The basic assumptions that support modern liberal economic theory 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.601
 Objectively wrong. 

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:26.434
 So today I want to first show you some of those misconceptions, 

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:32.500
 Then I explain to you what scientists propose to achieve true prosperity. 

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:37.559
 Well, the first hypothesis in the economy of modern liberalism is 

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:42.018
 That the market is an effective equilibrium system, 

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:48.059
 Meaning that in an economy if something increases, for example, salaries, 

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:52.250
 It must decrease another component in turn, like jobs. 

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.708
 For example, in Seattle, where I live, 

00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.976
 In 2014, when we exceeded our first $ 15 minimum wage in our country, 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.417
 Supporters of modern liberalism panicked for their precious balance. 

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:10.226
 And warn, "If you raise workers’ wages, 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.268
 It will reduce companies ’demand for them, 

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:14.833
 Thousands of low-wage workers will lose their jobs. 

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:16.726
 Restaurants will be closed. " 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.000
 But... 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.250
 It did not happen. 

00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:24.125
 Unemployment has decreased dramatically, 

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.018
 Seattle restaurants have thrived. 

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:29.292
 Why? 

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:32.500
 Because there is no balance. 

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.726
 And because increasing salaries does not kill job opportunities, it creates them. 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.226
 Because, for example, 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.143
 When restaurant owners suddenly become required to increase the salaries of workers sufficiently 

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:47.184
 Makes them able to go to restaurants and eat food there, 

00:05:47.208 --> 00:05:49.226
 It does not reduce restaurant projects, 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.698
 Rather, it is self-evident that it develops it. 

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:54.601
 (clap) 

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:56.042
 Thank you. 

00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:00.458
 The second hypothesis is 

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:06.893
 That the price is always equal to its value, 

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:10.476
 Which means that if you earn $ 50,000 a year, 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.434
 And I make $ 50 million a year, 

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:18.164
 The reason for this is that I have produced a thousand times more value than they produce. 

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:20.226
 And now, 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.893
 It will not surprise you to learn 

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:25.583
 This is a very comfortable hypothesis 

00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:28.515
 If you are a CEO you pay yourself $ 50 million a year 

00:06:28.515 --> 00:06:31.559
 While meager salaries are paid to your workers. 

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:35.726
 But please, get advice from someone who has run a lot of business and projects, 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.143
 This is not logical. 

00:06:38.167 --> 00:06:40.559
 People do not get salaries according to their value. 

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.851
 Rather, they get it according to their ability to negotiate. 

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.643
 The wage share of the gross domestic product decreases 

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:50.184
 It is not because workers have become less productive. 

00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:53.375
 Rather, business owners have become more powerful. 

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:55.601
 And... 

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.208
 (clap) 

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:04.643
 And it seems that the huge imbalance of power between capital and labor 

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.309
 Not Found, 

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:10.059
 It became theories of modern liberalism 

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:12.828
 It is basically a protection racket for the wealthy. 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.018
 The third hypothesis, which is the most harmful so far, 

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:17.351
 Is the behavioral model 

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:21.226
 Which describes human beings as "economic people." 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.476
 Which basically means that we are all selfish, 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.500
 Completely rational, and our interests continuously amplified. 

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.559
 But just ask yourselves, 

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:37.393
 Is it reasonable that every time, throughout your entire life, 

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:39.601
 Where you were doing something nice for someone else, 

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.893
 Were you doing that just to increase your own self? 

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:46.768
 Is it reasonable that every soldier jumps on a bomb to protect his fellow soldiers, 

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.518
 Was he doing just that to further his superficial personal interest? 

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:51.351
 If you thought that was crazy, 

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:54.476
 It is against any logical moral axioms, 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.309
 The reason is that it really is, 

00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:58.101
 According to the latest scientific theories, 

00:07:58.125 --> 00:07:59.768
 It is not correct. 

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:02.309
 But it is that behavioral paradigm 

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:05.601
 Located at the heart of a tough, cold modern liberal economy, 

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:09.309
 Devastating on an ethical level, 

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:11.851
 The wrong thing on the scientific level. 

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:16.934
 Because if we accept it outwardly 

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.768
 The idea that humans are fundamentally selfish, 

00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:22.018
 Then we took a look around the world 

00:08:22.042 --> 00:08:25.042
 For all the richness that is evident in it, 

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:28.934
 It makes sense. 

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.892
 It must be true, then by definition, 

00:08:30.892 --> 00:08:34.643
 That billions of individual selfish actions 

00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:38.684
 Magically transformed into wealth and common good. 

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:41.601
 If we humans are merely selfish creatures who pursue their interests 

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:45.207
 So selfishness is the reason for our wealth and well-being. 

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.726
 According to the economic rationale, 

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.707
 Greed is a good thing. 

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:54.018
 Widespread inequality is effective. 

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:56.393
 The sole purpose of setting up companies 

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:58.893
 It could be to enrich its shareholders, 

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:02.018
 Because doing otherwise would mean slowing economic growth 

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.833
 And damage the economy in general. 

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:08.726
 And this ideology of selfishness 

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.976
 Which forms the ideological cornerstone of the modern liberal economy, 

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.643
 The intellectual approach that produced economic policies 

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:20.393
 Which has enabled me and my fellow comrades in the top 1% income bracket 

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:24.375
 From almost all the benefits of economic growth over 40 years. 

00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:26.934
 But, 

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.018
 Instead of that 

00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:32.684
 If we accept the latest empirical research, 

00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:36.059
 And the real sciences that accurately describe humans 

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:39.268
 That they are very cooperative beings, 

00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:40.688
 And they believe in reciprocity, 

00:09:40.688 --> 00:09:43.518
 In addition to their natural sense in nature, 

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:46.184
 So it makes sense 

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:48.726
 It has to be cooperation 

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.351
 It is the reason for our prosperity 

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:52.143
 It is not selfishness, 

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:54.518
 Nor our personal interests, 

00:09:54.542 --> 00:09:57.167
 Rather, the reciprocity inherent in us. 

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.083
 That is the great power of humanity. 

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:06.309
 Thus, in the depth of this new economic system, 

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:11.101
 There is a story about us that allows us to be in our best form. 

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:14.101
 However, unlike the old economy, 

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.851
 This story is more honest 

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:19.708
 She also has the virtue of being real. 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.763
 And now, 

00:10:22.763 --> 00:10:25.125
 I would like to stress that this new economic system 

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.768
 Not something I personally imagined or invented. 

00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:30.601
 It is a collection of theories and models that are developed and improved 

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:32.643
 In universities around the world, 

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:35.976
 Based on some of the best and most recent research in economics, 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.893
 Like the theory of complexity, and the theory of evolution, 

00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:41.018
 Psychology, and anthropology, in addition to other disciplines. 

00:10:41.042 --> 00:10:45.851
 Although there are no references for that new economic system yet 

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:48.226
 It was not even agreed on a name for him, 

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.268
 generally 

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:54.458
 His interpretation of the causes and sources of wealth is very similar to what I explained. 

00:10:55.458 --> 00:11:00.018
 So, market capitalism is an evolutionary system 

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.296
 Richness stands out 

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:04.243
 Through mutual positive feedback 

00:11:04.243 --> 00:11:09.018
 Show the increasing amount of innovation and the increase in consumer demand. 

00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:13.667
 Innovation is the process by which we solve human problems, 

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:17.893
 And consumer demand is the mechanism by which the market is chosen 

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:20.309
 Useful innovations. 

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:23.559
 The more we succeed in solving more problems, the richer we become. 

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:27.559
 But as we get richer, 

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:29.393
 Our problems and solutions have become 

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:32.184
 more complicated. 

00:11:32.208 --> 00:11:35.351
 This requires increased technical sophistication 

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:39.893
 Higher levels of social and economic cooperation than ever before, 

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:42.809
 To produce more specialized products 

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:47.125
 Represent the new economy. 

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:52.726
 So the old economic system is right, of course, 

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.309
 That competition plays an important role in how the market works, 

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:58.434
 But what fails to see 

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:03.143
 Is that it is a competition between highly cooperative groups. 

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:07.934
 Any competition between companies, competition between networks of companies, 

00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.643
 Competition between peoples. 

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:14.559
 Anyone who has run a successful project will know 

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:18.333
 Building a collaborative team includes everyone's talents and skills 

00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:24.208
 It is probably the best plan always to choose a group of selfish fools. 

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:30.250
 How do we get rid of modern liberalism then, 

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:35.917
 We create a more sustainable and prosperous society 

00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:40.018
 And more just? 

00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:43.542
 The new economic system proposes only five rules to achieve this. 

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:50.583
 The first is that successful economies are like parks, not like forests, 

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.351
 In the sense that the markets 

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:58.167
 Like gardens, you need attention. 

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:03.934
 And the market is the greatest social technology ever devised 

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.434
 To solve human problems. 

00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:10.643
 But when you are not bound by social or democratic controls, 

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:14.018
 It inevitably leads to more problems than solutions. 

00:13:14.042 --> 00:13:15.309
 Climate change, 

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.309
 And the great financial crisis that occurred in 2008 

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.042
 They are two small examples of this. 

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.976
 The second rule is 

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 It is inclusion and inclusion that creates economic growth. 

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.768
 So the idea of ​​modern liberalism 

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:33.413
 Embedding is a luxury 

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:38.317
 It may only be made available to everyone if we have economic growth. It is a wrong and reversed idea. 

00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:41.667
 The economy is people. 

00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:44.726
 More people included in more ways 

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.792
 It is what leads to economic growth in the market economy. 

00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:51.934
 The third rule is 

00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:58.143
 The purpose of setting up companies is not just to enrich shareholders. 

00:13:58.167 --> 00:14:01.934
 The biggest trick in contemporary economic life 

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.934
 It is the modern liberal perception that the only goal of companies 

00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.851
 And the only responsibility of its superiors 

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:10.958
 Is to increase their wealth and that of their shareholders. 

00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:17.393
 The modern economy must be decided and determined 

00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:19.143
 That is the goal of the companies 

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:22.059
 It is to improve social welfare for all stakeholders, that is: 

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:24.309
 Customers, workers, 

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:26.417
 Society and contributors. 

00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:30.226
 The fourth rule is 

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.458
 Greed is not a good thing. 

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:38.351
 Being a greedy person doesn’t make you capitalist, 

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:40.434
 It makes you disordered. 

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:42.893
 (Laughter) 

00:14:42.917 --> 00:14:47.018
 (clap) 

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:52.226
 In a society that relies on cooperation on a large scale, like ours, 

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.605
 Social morbidity is a harmful pest in business as it is for society. 

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:58.625
 Fifth and last, 

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.667
 Unlike the laws of physics, 

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:07.375
 The laws of economics are optional. 

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.226
 As for the theory of modern liberal economics 

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:15.268
 I have convinced you that it is an immutable natural law that does not change. 

00:15:15.292 --> 00:15:19.184
 While in reality, they are social norms and prepared information 

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.667
 And built on false science. 

00:15:21.917 --> 00:15:24.589
 If we really wish to have an economy 

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:28.976
 Fairer, more prosperous and more sustainable, 

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.726
 And if we want effective political systems, 

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.976
 Civilized society, 

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 A new economic system is necessary. 

00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:38.768
 Here is the good news: 

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:40.851
 If we want a new economy, 

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:44.768
 All we have to do is choose to have it. 

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:46.059
 Thanks. 

00:15:46.083 --> 00:15:51.042
 (clap) 

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:07.345
 Interviewer: Okay, Nick, I'm sure you're getting this question a lot. 

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:11.434
 If you were never satisfied with the economic system, 

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:16.184
 So why not donate all of your wealth and join the 99%? 

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:18.976
 Nick Hanauer: Yes, no, yes, right. 

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.934
 I often receive this question. 

00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.684
 "As long as you care a lot about taxes, why not pay more, 

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:26.601
 And as long as you care about the salaries, why not pay more? 

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:27.917
 And I can do that. 

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.601
 But the problem is, 

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.434
 It will not make much difference, 

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.018
 I also discovered a plan 

00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:36.976
 Literally a hundred thousand times better. 

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.268
 Interviewer: Okay. 

00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:41.851
 Nick Hanauer: It's to use my wealth to craft information and make laws 

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.934
 That requires that all the wealthy pay 

00:16:43.934 --> 00:16:46.262
 Taxes, and to pay better wages for their workers. 

00:16:46.332 --> 00:16:47.851
 (clap) 

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:49.226
 and for example, 

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.785
 So the $ 15 minimum salary requirement that we created 

00:16:52.785 --> 00:16:54.601
 It has now affected 30 million workers. 

00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:55.713
 Therefore, this solution is better. 

00:16:55.713 --> 00:16:56.607
 Interviewer: Great. 

00:16:56.607 --> 00:16:59.185
 And if you change your mind, we can find some beneficiaries for you. 

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:02.439
 Nick Hanauer: Okay. Thanks. Interviewer: Thank you very much.
