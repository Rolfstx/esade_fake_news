00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:01.168
Less than an hour ago,

00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:02.569
President Trump finished

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:05.105
his third State of the Union
address.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.708
Now, the State of the Union
has been going on

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:09.176
for hundreds of years.
I know that.

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:10.844
But-but when you take
a step back,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.847
you have to admit, it's kind of
weird as a tradition, right?

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.515
'Cause why does the president
get to give

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.950
his own job evaluation?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.286
That's strange.
Nobody else gets to do that.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:22.155
He's just up there, like,
"My economy, the best ever.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.291
"My military, the best ever.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.425
"My children,

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.961
"eh, D-plus.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.431
Eric, Eric,
you're holding us down."

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.167
But this year's State
of the Union was extra weird,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.702
because, in case you forgot,

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.705
it's happening right in the
middle of Trump's impeachment.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.042
Right? So, for months,
Democrats have been saying

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.111
that Trump is a threat
to democracy

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.512
and a danger to the republic.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.581
But now they just have
to sit there and clap

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.316
while he gives a speech.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.951
That is wild.
It's like two di--

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.953
It's-it's like you're
in the middle of firing someone

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.354
who's belligerent at work,

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.690
but then you get interrupted
by their birthday party.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.425
You know what I mean?
It's like,

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:00.961
"You were caught stealing, Jake.
You're always late.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.499
"You're a sc...
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.701
♪ Happy birth... ♪
"You're fired.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.636
♪ To-to you. ♪

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.105
(quietly):
I'm gonna kill you."

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.974
Now, not everyone,

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:16.043
not everyone was willing to deal
with tonight's awkwardness.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:18.645
At least ten Democrats decided
that they were gonna boycott

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.982
the speech, including
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:23.583
-(cheering and applause)
-Right? Who tweeted,

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.419
who tweeted-- and I love this--

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.754
she was like,
"None of this is normal,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.690
and I will not legitimize it."

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.693
Which makes sense. And I'm
totally gonna use that excuse

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.828
to get out of any plans
in the future.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.630
I'm just gonna be like,
"It is not normal

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.898
"to throw a gender reveal party.

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.167
I will not legitimize it!"

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:41.969
But for those who did show up,

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.471
they got to witness
a very awkward start

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.140
to the State of the Union,
where Nancy Pelosi tried

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.344
to shake Trump's hand
but he was having none of it.

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.346
(applause)

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.317
(audience oohing)

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.719
Ooh.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.253
That's embarrassing.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.722
That's embarrassing.
Now, look,

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.724
either Trump didn't see
Pelosi's hand

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.459
or he just didn't want
to shake it.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.394
But, honestly, I think
it was probably for the best.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.730
Yeah. Because she's wearing
a white suit. Yeah.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.265
And then she'd have nowhere
to wipe off the chicken grease

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.201
that's always
on the president's hands.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.204
That combined with spray tan,
it doesn't come out.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:19.539
But awkward handshake aside,

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.541
Trump was focused tonight,

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.478
and he dove right
into his greatest hits.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.880
I am thrilled to report
to you tonight

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.850
that our economy
is the best it has ever been.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.651
Our families are flourishing.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.321
Our values are renewed.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.990
Our pride is restored.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.259
The state of our union

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.529
is stronger than ever before.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.531
(cheering and applause)

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.376
(laughter)

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.378
(cheering and applause)

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.784
Oh, man.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.987
Oh, man. You know what I love
about old black people's faces?

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:09.189
They always tell the truth.
Always tell the truth.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.458
'Cause you can tell Congressman
James Clyburn over here

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.126
did not agree with that one.
Like, look at that.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:16.263
That's the face of every
old-timer in the barbershop

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:18.598
when someone says any basketball
player is better than Jordan.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.333
They're just like,
"Come on, man.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.802
"He got six rings,

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.203
"and he beat the Monstars.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:26.740
Come on, man."

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.009
Now, traditionally,
traditionally,

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.144
the State of the Union
is more about

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:34.414
what the president has done
and what he plans to do.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:38.318
But, tonight, Trump took a lot
of time out of his speech

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:41.188
to show off
his player-hating degree.

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:44.925
If we hadn't reversed
the failed economic policies

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.260
of the previous administration,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.330
the world would not
now be witnessing

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.333
this great economic success.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.736
My administration reversed
the failing policies

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.207
of the previous administration
on Cuba.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:01.875
Under the last administration,

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.010
more than ten million people
were added

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.546
to the food stamp rolls.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.882
In eight years
under the last administration,

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:13.453
over 300,000 working-age people
dropped out of the workforce.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.721
Come on. Really?

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.457
It's been three years
since Obama's been out

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:20.127
of the White House, but, still,
Trump is obsessed with him.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:23.063
He's just after-- I wonder if
he does this with Melania, too.

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:26.333
You know? Just like,
"Remember your ex, Ivan?

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:30.804
"Well, guess what, he still
works at Slovenian Food Locker.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:35.408
And I bet he never got you
your own bedroom to sleep in."

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.410
And you may remember,
you may remember,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.013
last year,
Trump took a lot of flak

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:42.015
for delivering
a State of the Union address

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.416
during Black History Month

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.185
and barely mentioning
black people.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:47.120
But this year,
the commander in chief

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.356
rode in on the soul train.

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:51.491
African-American youth
unemployment

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:55.095
has reached an all-time low.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:58.064
African-American poverty
has declined

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:01.868
to the lowest rate
ever recorded.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.671
We achieved record
and permanent funding

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.841
for our nation's
historically black colleges

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.676
and universities.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.011
Opportunity Zones,

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:14.948
a plan spearheaded
by Senator Tim Scott

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:19.019
-as part of our great Republican
tax cuts. -(applause, cheering)

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.354
Opportunity Zones
are helping Americans,

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:24.024
like Army veteran Tony Rankins.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:26.226
A few weeks ago,
I signed a bill

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:28.261
promoting Charles McGee

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.996
to "Brigadier General."

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.332
-Thank you, sir.
-(cheers and applause)

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.534
Damn. Donald Trump made sure

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:37.537
that this time,
his speech was a lot more black.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.973
Yeah, although I do think
he went too far

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.309
when he delivered the rest
of the speech in a do-rag.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.444
-That was a bit extreme.
-(laughter)

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.947
Was a bit extreme.

00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:49.149
Now, of course...

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.852
Now, of course, no Trump speech
would be complete

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.388
without an absolute blatant lie.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.324
And for tonight's address,

00:05:57.324 --> 00:06:00.660
Trump went with an old classic,
and that is

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.964
that he's the champion
of health care.

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:07.601
I've also made an ironclad
pledge to American families.

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:11.771
We will always protect patients
with preexisting conditions.

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.974
(cheers and applause)

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:15.742
Really?

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.178
That lie is so extreme
that if Trump was Pinocchio,

00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:20.280
he would have impaled
Mitch McConnell in his seat.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.082
(laughter)

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:23.583
Just stabbed him
right in the chest.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.719
"Muh. Joke's on you.
I'm all skin. Muh."

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.487
(laughter)

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.522
-Because...
-(applause)

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:32.225
Because here's the truth.
Here's the truth, right?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.394
Trump tried
to kill protections

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.364
for preexisting conditions
when he went after Obamacare.

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:40.500
And right now, right now,
his administration is in court

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.202
trying to kill it again.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:44.170
So him claiming
to be the champion

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.939
of protecting
preexisting conditions

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.741
is like the Coronavirus
being like,

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.277
"I love Chinese people.
I really do! I really do!"

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:52.379
(laughter)

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.148
But if there was one theme for
tonight's State of the Union,

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.251
it was Trump doing
what he does best--

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.022
creating a show made for TV.

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:03.923
TRUMP:
I can proudly announce tonight

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:07.460
that an Opportunity Scholarship
has become available.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.397
It's going to you,
and you will soon be heading

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:13.033
to the school of your choice.

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:14.968
(cheers and applause)

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.103
And Rush, in recognition

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.206
of all that you have done
for our nation,

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:22.042
I am proud to announce tonight

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:24.177
that you will be receiving
our country's

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:26.980
highest civilian honor--

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.449
the Presidential
Medal of Freedom.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.117
(cheers and applause)

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.553
Tonight,
we have a very special surprise.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:35.155
I am thrilled to inform you

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:37.357
that your husband is back
from deployment.

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:39.059
He is here with us tonight,

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.861
and we couldn't keep him waiting
any longer!

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.363
(cheers and applause)

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:45.732
Okay, he might not be
a great president,

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:48.401
but you have to admit, this man
knows how to put on a show.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.137
'Cause the entire night,
he just kept announcing surprise

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.972
after surprise after surprise.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:55.442
Like, I thought by the end
of the night, he was gonna go,

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:58.745
"Believe it or not, folks,
I've locked up Hillary Clinton!

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.413
"Bring out the cage!

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:02.682
"Bring out the cage,
Jeffrey Epstein!

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.751
That's right, folks!
Surprise, surprise!"

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.020
(laughter)

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.024
So, that was the final State of
the Union of Trump's first term,

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:14.427
and judging by the 212 standing
ovations on the Republican side,

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.862
they're loving their guy.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:17.263
But as for the Democrats,

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:21.401
I think Nancy Pelosi's actions
speak louder than words.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.503
-(applause and cheering)
-Thank you. God bless you.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.372
And God bless America.

00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:27.507
Thank you very much.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.845
(indistinct chatter)

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.319
LESTER HOLT:
A stunning moment here

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.488
at the end
of the president's speech.

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:44.991
Nancy Pelosi tearing up
what appeared to be a copy

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:48.061
-of the president's speech.
-WOMAN: Wow.

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:50.497
-Holy shit!
-(laughter)

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:52.732
Nancy Pelosi has done it again.

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.834
I feel like every year,
she finds a new way

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.736
to show Trump
just how little she thinks

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.138
of him and his speech.

00:08:58.138 --> 00:08:59.939
Because last year, you remember,
was the sideways clap.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.775
-You remember that? Yeah?
-(laughter)

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.910
And then this year,
she rips up his speech.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.446
Trump better pray he doesn't get
another State of the Union,

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.615
because at this rate, next time,
she's just gonna show up

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.750
and throw vegetables at him
during the speech.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.320
He'll be like,
"No. Please, no vegetables! No!

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.524
I'd rather be reimpeached!"

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:19.793
Now, on a normal night,

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:23.963
the State of the Union
would be the major news,

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.465
but right now--

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:27.667
and here's something
you only hear every four years--

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.502
everyone is talking about Iowa.

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.237
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.374
Because last night
was the Iowa Caucuses, right?

00:09:34.374 --> 00:09:37.010
The first vote of the Democratic
primary campaign.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.546
And normally,
we would know by now who'd won.

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.214
In fact, normally,
we would have known last night.

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:44.184
But this year, Democrats decided
to use a new app

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.286
to help count the votes,

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:49.656
and, uh,
it has not gone as planned.

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:51.324
The only results
from the Iowa Caucus

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:53.693
at this hour
are chaos and confusion.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.295
Chaos, confusion, meltdown--

00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:58.398
pick your adjective
to describe Iowa Caucuses.

00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:02.135
What a mess! This is not
the finish that anyone expected.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:03.736
It certainly was a mess,

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.506
and some here are calling it
a disaster.

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:08.842
WOMAN 4: Organizers in the state
cite a domino effect

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.510
of problems for the delay.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.312
Several issues with the new app

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:14.247
where results were
to be inputted.

00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:16.216
They had a-a really crummy app

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.451
that, uh, screwed up
the entire thing.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.855
Right now, no idea when we are
going to know the results.

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:23.790
So, everyone
really is just waiting

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.025
for these official results...

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:28.995
So, we wait, and at the moment,
we have nothing.

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:31.164
(laughter)

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:34.601
You know... you know what I love
about cable news in America--

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:36.936
right?-- is their dedication
to filling air time

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.338
with absolutely nothing.

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:40.740
Right? 'Cause they're like,
"We're not getting any results.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.175
Uh, nothing is happening."

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:44.310
It's like, okay, do you guys
want to cover the coronavirus

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.812
or some other international news
in the meantime?

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.347
It's like,
"No, no, we'll just keep talking

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:48.882
"about how nothing is happening.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:50.283
"Anything yet? No? Nothing?

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:53.386
More nothing? Okay.
Uh-huh, uh, more nothing? Yeah?"

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:55.688
But yes, the app that
the Democrats commissioned

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.991
to make vote-counting easier
ended up malfunctioning

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.326
and screwing up
the entire night.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.928
And I guess, what do you expect?

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:03.930
I mean, the average age
of the party leadership

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.198
is, like, 85 years old.

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:06.599
Right? What do they know
about apps?

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.001
The only thing
they know about apps

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.336
is that you get one for free
with the early bird special.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.605
That's it. And honestly,
it's a little embarrassing

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.307
for the world's greatest
democracy

00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:16.543
to have such a hard time
counting votes.

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:18.611
I mean,
America is usually the one

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:21.514
teaching the rest of the world
how to vote.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.516
But maybe next time
Africa should send

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.119
some election observers to Iowa,
that's what they should do.

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:28.655
They'd be like, "Ah,
I can fix this for you, ah?

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.857
"Yeah, we've been fixing
elections for many years.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.293
-Don't worry."
-(laughter, applause)

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.297
So...

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:38.731
so, because of this app,

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:40.900
the whole night was thrown
into utter chaos.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.602
Nobody knew
what the problem was.

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:44.404
Nobody knew who won,
and eventually,

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.372
the candidates got tired
of waiting.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.508
And they came out
to try and spin the non-results

00:11:48.508 --> 00:11:50.977
in the best way they could: "Oh,
we're happy, things are great,

00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:52.445
this is gonna be good for us."

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:57.116
But one candidate in particular
took that to the next level.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.285
So, we're still waiting
for any results

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.654
from last night's
Iowa Democratic caucuses.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:03.957
But... that
hasn't stopped candidates

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:06.225
from spinning
the nonexistent results.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.394
Former mayor of South Bend
Pete Buttigieg

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.663
declared victory overnight.
Listen.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.666
We know, by the time
it's all said and done,

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.970
Iowa, you have shocked
the nation.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:22.709
By all indications, we are going
on to New Hampshire victorious!

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:24.243
(cheering)

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:27.246
(laughter)

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.815
Well, okay, Pete.

00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:31.317
You're just gonna come out
and claim victory

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:33.920
even though no results
were in at that point?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.588
That's a pretty bold move.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.557
I mean, maybe
that's just his thing.

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:39.759
Maybe Pete does that.
Anytime anything's ambiguous,

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.195
no one knows, he just jumps in.
You know, like,

00:12:42.195 --> 00:12:45.331
(British accent): "Now, nobody
knows who built Stonehenge..."

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.701
He's like, "Oh, it was me,
it was me, I did it. I did it."

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.703
So the whole night was chaos.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:53.039
And what's interesting,
what's really interesting

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.642
is that even before
last night's meltdown,

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:59.212
people were worried
about relying on this app.

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:01.781
Right? But the head
of Iowa's Democratic Party

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.717
was like, "Don't worry, baby,
we got this."

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.185
NEWSMAN:
The day before the caucus

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.987
we asked state party chairman
Troy Price

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.956
if he had any fear
about tech glitches

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.224
or other problems.

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:12.892
Do you have
a nightmare scenario,

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.761
and if so,
what do you do about it?

00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:16.763
These are probably the most
prepared we've ever been

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:18.197
as party for these caucuses.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.966
We've run through
a few different scenarios,

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.834
but I can tell you we're ready.

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.836
(groaning, laughter)

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:27.607
(applause)

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:35.915
This is the most prepared
you've ever been as a party?

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:38.484
So what would have happened
if you didn't prepare?

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.320
"Bad news, everyone.
The app automatically changed

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.823
"all of the votes
to the GEICO Lizard.

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:47.126
Uh, so he's our nominee now."

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:49.595
Now, even though last night
was a disaster,

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:51.864
honestly, the caucus system
wasn't that great

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.866
even before the app meltdown.

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:55.401
It's a crazy, crazy system.

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:58.471
Because in the Iowa caucus,
you don't just come in and vote.

00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:01.274
It's a whole complicated system
where you spend hours

00:14:01.274 --> 00:14:05.812
walking around and building
coalitions in a hot gym.

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:08.214
You know?
It's like a high school dance

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.450
without the possibility
of a hand job.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.884
-(laughter)
-And...

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:13.953
and apparently,
when there's a tie,

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.789
that's when the rules get
really dumb.

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:19.292
There's 11 delegates
to split up,

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:22.528
and you can't split 'em in half,
so the fairest way to decide

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.530
is a coin toss.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.265
She's gonna call heads or tails.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.267
-WOMAN: Okay.
-WOMAN 2: Tails.

00:14:30.837 --> 00:14:32.672
(indistinct talking)

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:38.511
-Okay...
-(laughter)

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:43.649
It's... it's bad enough
to break ties with a coin flip,

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.853
but it looked like this guy
didn't even know how to do...

00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:49.388
a coin flip.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:52.658
You... you can't have people
that young flipping coins.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.694
They don't use real money
anymore.

00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:57.530
We're lucky he didn't open
the Venmo on his phone

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.032
-and just throw it up
in the air. -(laughter)

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.667
What was that?

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.669
(applause)

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:07.373
So, the Iowa caucuses
were a mess,

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.275
and it never would have happened

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:12.645
if the Democrats didn't try
to rely on that new fancy app.

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:15.815
Luckily, though, luckily...
there's another hot new solution

00:15:15.815 --> 00:15:18.017
that just came out
of Silicon Valley

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:21.587
that can fix voting forever.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:25.291
WOMAN: Introducing the latest
in voting technology,

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:27.760
thousands of years
in the making.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.529
Meet... paper--

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:32.398
the newest innovation
in counting ballots.

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.567
It's only
half a millimeter thin,

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:38.070
fits in your pocket,
and holds its charge forever.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.373
Paper has
a user-friendly interface

00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:42.542
for election officials
of any age,

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:44.510
with cutting-edge technology.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.145
Really cutting-edge.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.413
(gasps)
Ahh.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:50.249
Available
in both mini and pro models.

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:52.752
Best of all, it's hacker-proof,

00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:54.854
and always beats rock.

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:58.691
PAyPR. Why complicate things.

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.691
I can't wait for the future.
