00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.720
Ezra Klein:  why don't you describe for me as vividly as you can

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.020
what it is you're worried about. what it is
nightmare scenario looks like?

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.060
Bill Gates: Fortunately, there's very few things
and most of them are very low

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.170
probability

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.990
some big volcanic explosion

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.789
A giant earthquake, asteroid

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.800
At least in the nuclear case

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.090
you gotta say we take it quite seriously.
We budget a lot of money, have a lot of

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.269
people who think about nuclear deterrence,

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.601
I'm very glad that works being done and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.730
I rate the chance of a nuclear war in my
lifetime has being fairly low.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.820
I rate the chance of a widespread
epidemic far worse than Ebola

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.169
in my lifetime as well over 50 percent.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.740
If we look at the 20th Century, and we look at the death chart

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.590
of the 20th Century, I think everybody
would say oh yeah there must be a spike

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.100
from World War I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.410
and you know sure enough there it is like
25 million

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.560
and I must be a big spike for World War II,
and there it is –&nbsp;like 65 million

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.610
but then you'll see this other spike
that

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.410
is as large as World War II, right
after World War I – and most people, a lot

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.470
of people say what?  Wait a minute –&nbsp;what was that?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.300
There's two kinds of flus:

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
There's flus that spread between humans very effectively

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.910
and there's flus that kill lots of
people. And those two properties have

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.640
only been combined

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.900
I into a widespread flu

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.020
once in history.  That is Spanish Flu.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.480
We have no idea where it
came from  – it's called the Spanish flu

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.720
because the Spanish press was the freest,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.880
they were the first to talk openly about it.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.160
and so in the annals of epidemic
history that's the big event.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.740
I funded a disease modeling group that
uses computer simulation

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.030
and that work has been phenomenal in
helping us

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.950
target our polio eradication resources
– which parts of nigeria should we

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.619
work harder on? And it's very natural if
you have a group like that to say hey

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.470
look at something like the Spanish flu
in the modern day.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.870
Health systems are far better and so you'd think, hey that wouldn't be very bad.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.220
Well, we tried it –  and there are some assumptions we had to make – but what we showed is that the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.520
force of infection, because modern
transport

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.620
which be compared to 1918 is over fifty
times as great,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.440
if you get something like the [Spanish] flu
and you look at that map

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.060
of how within days it's basically

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.230
in all urban centers of the entire globe

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.930
That is very, uh, eye-opening.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.100
that didn't happen with Spanish flu in
the past.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.160
The opportunity in did do more than just

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.489
let it run its course is really only in
the last decade

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.280
basically when you talk about drugs, you can talk about small molecules or you can talk about

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.760
these

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.530
complex biological protein like things
which is a subclass called antibodies

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.750
antibodies are the molecules the immune
system naturally builds to attack disease

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.810
Today, the idea that somebody says oh
here's an antibody

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.819
make a lot of it made it very quickly
that's right on the cutting edge.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.700
and the Ebola epidemic showed me that
we're not ready

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.260
for a serious epidemic. An epidemic that
would be more infectious and would spread faster

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.219
than Ebola did. This is the greatest
risk

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.879
have a huge tragedy. This is the most
likely thing by far

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.040
to kill over 10 million excess people

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.859
in a year. We don't need to invest nearly
what we do

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.459
in military preparedness. this is
something where

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.109
less than a billion a year on R&amp;D,
medical surveillance,

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.790
on standby personnel, cross-training the
military so they can play a role in

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.949
terms of all the logistics here. This can
be done

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.090
and we may not get many more warnings
like this one

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.599
to to say okay it's a pretty modest
investment

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.540
to avoid something that, really, in terms
of the human condition would be a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.389
gigantic setback.
