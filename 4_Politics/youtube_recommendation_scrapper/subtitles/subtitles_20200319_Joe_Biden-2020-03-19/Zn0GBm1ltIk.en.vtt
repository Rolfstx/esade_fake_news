00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.402
Stop.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.377
Relax, relax.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.077
Relax.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.546
Put your kickstand down.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.981
All right, where's mom and dad?

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:15.882
Oh, at home.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.418
OK, have a seat.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.719
What are you guys doing, man?

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:20.520
You can't be running.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.454
Huh?

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.722
You can't be
running like that.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.257
I wasn't running.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.859
Both of you looked at
me with my lights on.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.394
Yeah, and I was stopping
right here for you.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.895
Dude, that was way back there.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:29.929
That was way back up College.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.198
Well, I didn't see
you back there then.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.100
You guys accelerated
across the parking lot

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.201
when I hit my lights.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.302
I actually didn't see you.
I swear.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:36.970
We didn't.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.937
I'm so sorry.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:38.738
We would have stopped.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:39.973
OK, have a seat, boys.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:40.840
On the ground?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.541
Yes.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.042
Who's got a cell phone?

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.778
Just sit on your butt, man.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:46.112
I don't want to
get my pants dirty.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.214
Then sit on the grass.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.216
Whose bike?

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.152
My friend said
I could ride it.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.686
OK.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:54.954
Well, he left it at my house.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.123
And then he said that I
could ride it if I wanted to.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.559
And he hasn't been
back for a few days.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.661
OK, do you want the
good news or bad news?

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.363
I don't care.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.631
OK, there's no good news.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.765
OK.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.300
OK, the bad news is you
have to have a driver's

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.402
license to ride this.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.870
[inaudible].

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.305
There's no license plate.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.773
Your light's not
working right here.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.843
You didn't stop at
a stop sign, OK?

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:20.780
And you probably
don't have insurance.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.615
All right, what's mom
or dad's phone number?

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.688
So we've got a possible
stolen hit on this motorcycle.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.157
Their parents are en
route, and I'm going

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.092
to take that up with them.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.294
Are you giving your
boys permission

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.361
to ride that motorcycle?

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.865
They said you
gave them permission

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.233
to ride on the street.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.470
No, not supposed to be on the
street, and you know that.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.606
[inaudible] and they
took off on it when--

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.207
What's that?

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.680
Whose bike is it?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.447
You bought it?

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:55.048
So it's yours?

00:01:59.018 --> 00:01:59.786
Who did you buy it from?

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.423
OK.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.226
If we receive confirmation,
you're going to go

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.228
for receiving stolen property.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.729
So you're taking me to jail?

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.866
Yes, sir, if
they confirm that.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.468
If they come back and
say it's not confirmed,

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.736
then you haven't
anything to worry about.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:20.607
Affirmative.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.509
They're now saying
it is confirmed.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.676
[inaudible]

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:24.477
What?

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.913
OK, it's confirmed stolen.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:27.981
- OK.
- OK?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.182
So he'll be on book and release.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:33.019
I'll call you when he
gets to the jail, OK?

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.220
Yeah.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.321
Any questions?

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.022
No.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.023
I understand.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.958
OK.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.226
The dad admitted
that he purchased

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.495
the motorcycle for
$30, didn't receive

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.531
a title or anything like that.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:48.902
And so he's going to jail for
receiving stolen property.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:51.538
The mom on scene took
custody of her juvenile.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.673
And the other one's going to
be taken to his residence.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:01.848
So we just received a report
from a concerned citizen

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.118
about a vehicle that left
an apartment complex with

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:08.321
a possibly intoxicated driver.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.924
Dispatch just
updated that the RP

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.561
has located the vehicle
parked at a local market

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.296
here on North Main Street.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.698
It appears that the driver's
passed out inside the vehicle.

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:24.404
Center [inaudible] in the area.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:25.505
Vehicle's in the parking lot.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.677
Looks like the driver is still
sitting in the driver's seat.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:45.224
So he's passed out with
a beer in his hand, so--

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.260
and we'll cite him for
parking in a handicapped spot.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.231
You're the one who called?

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.933
We have your phone
number in the cab.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.034
I'll give you a
call a bit later.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.102
Did you see him driving?

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:56.803
Yes, yes.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.837
Yeah, we did.

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:58.805
We were pulling up
to some apartments,

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.173
and he was to a friend's house.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.608
And we actually seen him--

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.309
I mean, he couldn't walk.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.312
He was stumbling, and even
kind of focusing with one eye.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.947
So we call the cops.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.048
Well, we called you guys.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.416
And then we kind
of followed to see

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.251
more or less where he was going,
because I was just afraid--

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.386
How was his driving
when you were following?

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.153
You know what?

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.221
He looked bad, really bad.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.222
OK.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.223
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:18.725
to use your statement
in order to do

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.193
the DUI investigation, OK?

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.928
Because you saw him
drive away with it.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:22.862
Yeah.
[inaudible]

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:23.429
All right.
OK.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.030
Thank you.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.023
What's up, Chief?

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:51.424
Got it?

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:52.959
Yeah, I was just waiting for
cover because he's zonked out,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:53.660
yeah.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.560
[interposing voices]

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.795
I got you covered.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:59.132
We got an RP, said they
saw him stumble to his car,

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.400
drive out of the
apartment complex,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.300
and they located him here.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.001
We pulled up.

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:03.202
He was just like this.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:03.903
So--

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:04.504
Yeah.

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:16.883
[speaking spanish]

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.608
Come on.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:43.509
Step out.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.877
Come on.

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.013
Come on.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.182
OK, he's going to come
out himself, he says.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.350
[speaking spanish]

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.342
[inaudible] I got
one detain for DUI.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.783
Stepping out, you could tell he
was very unsteady on his feet.

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.418
There was a strong
odor of alcohol coming

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.919
from his breath in person.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.389
And it was apparent that
he was highly intoxicated.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.891
He stated he wants to
give us a breath test.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.862
We'll find out just how much
alcohol he has on board.

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:36.462
Ready?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.601
Good job.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.335
Just got it.

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:46.272
Volume there.

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:46.973
Yeah.

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.741
They need 210 liters.

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.442
Yeah.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:52.044
Yep, good.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:55.715
So after doing
both breath tests,

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.049
his first breath
test was a 0.21.

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:59.285
His second was a 0.20.

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.187
So he's almost three
times the legal limit.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.597
So now we're responding
to a call of a subject

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.232
armed with a handgun.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.400
Two officers are on scene.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.871
And it appears to be
they located the subject.

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.373
So right now they
have them at gunpoint.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.041
Unknown if they're cooperative.

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:22.642
Frank 497.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:36.589
Yeah, no problem.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.523
In just a second.

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:38.991
Let everybody stand up, OK?

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:44.463
Hold on, man.

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:45.765
That's awesome.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:47.200
So, dude in the black shirt,
black shirt closest to us,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.701
go ahead and stand up slowly.

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.502
Yeah, stand up slowly.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.170
Keep your hands in the air.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.472
Now walk towards us, or
just walk towards us.

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:54.740
Center, 2 Frank 4.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.809
Our final is going to be
[inaudible] and [inaudible]..

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.178
We're facing northbound
on [inaudible],,

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.913
and we have a [inaudible].

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:10.223
Come here.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.891
Sit over here.

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:12.825
Sit over here.

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:16.062
Hang on.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.029
Just stay down, man.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.098
We'll tell you when
you get up, OK?

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.032
Black shirt?

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.267
Black shirt, go
ahead and stand up.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:24.270
Hands all the way in the air.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.572
Don't-- don't-- yeah, just
keep your hands up, man.

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.211
Anybody have a gun on them?

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.113
How do the neighbors know
it's going to be a toy gun?

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.048
People can't differentiate
between a real gun

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.717
and a CO2 gun, you know?

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.352
That's why you've
got to be careful.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:39.952
So right now, we--

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.361
We got one.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:56.769
Hey, this looks like a Glock,
man, or it's a Glock replica,

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:57.670
like exactly.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.071
He says it's Airsoft.

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.072
Airsoft Glock replica?

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:07.313
Hey, Dave, if you
can ask them if it's

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.116
just going to be the one fake?

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.851
Why are you guys
walking around with that?

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.086
Because if I was driving by--
and I know someone called you

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:15.788
in-- but if I was driving,
I saw you with that gun,

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.456
same exact thing would happen.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:18.724
And if you guys
aren't as cooperative,

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.092
you don't immediately
put it down,

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.294
I guarantee you I
would've shot you.

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:23.396
That looks identical
to a real gun.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.497
Keep that thing in your house.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.831
Your buddy's going
to stay in the car.

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.235
And you guys are all good to go.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.102
Not in our car.

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:31.637
It's staying in your car.

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.538
Yeah, we're not keeping it.

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:33.706
That's all good.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.007
Just keep it at
your house, man.

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:35.841
[inaudible] in our car.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:36.976
Yeah, that's--

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:37.777
All right, man.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:38.711
See you later.

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.914
[interposing voices]

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:42.715
I appreciate you guys.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:43.716
Thank you so much.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.017
All right, you
guys have a good one.

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:47.453
You guys have a good one.

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:48.587
It was a replica firearm.

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:50.756
So it looked identical
to an actual firearm.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.392
And we've had several
shootings, including

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:58.297
officer-involved shootings,
that have been with firearms

00:09:58.297 --> 00:09:59.298
that turned out to be fake.

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:01.534
So hopefully, they
learned from that,

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.536
and they won't be carrying
around the fake firearm,

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.937
waving it in the air anymore.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.412
So we're going to stop
this car in front of us.

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:16.983
Just ran the license plate, and
the registration is expired.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.617
And it shows the-- not
have any insurance.

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.853
So just have a quick
chat with the driver,

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:22.755
and see if they're having
some trouble with that.

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.159
Good evening.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.527
Hey, I'm Deputy Johnson
with the Williams

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.729
County Sheriff's Office.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:32.198
Do you know the reason I
stopped you tonight, bud?

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.332
Yeah, the registration's out.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:34.066
No big deal or anything.

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.038
Let me ask you a
real quick question.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:39.772
I'll be cool with you.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:41.107
You be cool with me, OK?

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:42.041
Do you smoke weed in this car?

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.312
OK, so because I kind
of got a whiff of it.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.947
And I'm not saying you
got any or anything.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:48.647
I mean, yeah.

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:49.448
You got a little bit?

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:51.817
Ain't no big deal.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.152
You're going to give it to me?

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:53.986
OK.

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:54.887
No weapons or anything, right?

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:55.588
OK, cool.

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:56.455
Let me-- let me--

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:57.757
OK.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.191
OK, cool.

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:01.027
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to have you step out.

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:02.995
I'm going to detain you, but
you're not under arrest, OK?

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.330
No weapons or anything on you?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.931
OK, like I said, right now,
you're just being detained.

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.566
You're not under arrest, OK?

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:09.902
OK, what I want you to do right
now is have a seat on the curb

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:10.836
right there for me.

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.238
All right, cool.

00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:15.374
Here, I'm going to help you
down so you don't hurt yourself.

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:18.210
I'll tell you what,
man, not often

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.347
do you stop somebody who's
as honest as you've been.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.681
You know what I'm saying?

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.717
Real talk, a lot of times people
are like, man, I don't know.

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:25.551
I ain't got nothing.

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:27.319
Why you--

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.323
I appreciate that.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.525
As soon as you roll
down the window,

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.727
I could smell a pretty
strong odor of marijuana.

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:36.662
But he was real
cool, real honest.

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:39.665
He even handed me the weed,
real small amount of marijuana.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:41.734
So all I'm going to do right now
is make sure he's not wanted,

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:44.103
see if his license is good.

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:48.908
And then if that's the case,
I'll just cut him a ticket.

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:51.777
Yeah, you ain't
wanted or nothing, dawg.

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:53.012
I can't find a license
for you, though.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:04.690
Bro, bro, bro, you're the
most honest dude I ever--

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:18.604
All right, here's what I'm
going to do for you, man.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.139
You've been real cool with me.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.173
I appreciate honesty.

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.274
I told you honesty
goes a long way, OK?

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:23.876
So I ain't going to take
you to jail tonight.

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:25.111
- Ticket?
- Yeah.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:26.312
I'm going to cut you a
ticket, but I'm going to do

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:27.546
you one bigger solid than that.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:29.215
I'm going to cut you a class
C ticket for possession

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:30.649
of drug paraphernalia.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.518
I'm going to submit that
weed for destruction.

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.220
All right, go ahead
and stand up for me.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.021
OK, so we let him off
and just gave him a ticket.

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.156
This is the thing.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:40.025
If you're honest with
us, this is how it goes.

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.861
So just be honest with us,
and we'll be cool with you.

00:12:55.274 --> 00:13:00.913
This car right here was
going 62 in a 35 over there.

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:04.550
Just want to see what's going
on, why they're going so fast--

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.651
also didn't have a seat belt on.

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:15.394
Hey, stay in the car, sir.

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:16.929
Stay in the car, sir.

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:17.730
Get back in the car.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:21.400
What are you doing?

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.402
All right, come here.

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:25.304
Stand over here.

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:26.906
What do you need to go
to the hospital for?

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:27.506
237 City.

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:32.378
Lean against here.

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:33.946
City, start an ambulance.

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.181
I stopped a car.

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.415
He was trying to get to the
hospital with an injury.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:39.852
We're in the Bingo
parking lot, 44th,

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:44.056
just to the west of
I35, 44th Street.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.658
What did you do, man?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.928
Good

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:50.930
OK.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.231
Sit down and put your feet up.

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.766
I'm going to get some
stuff to fix your leg.

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:54.733
Not on my car.

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:56.635
Are you drunk?

00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:57.670
You sure?

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.437
Sit on the ground.

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.476
Sit tight for me.

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:05.377
I'm going to get some
stuff to put on that.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.081
What you do it at, bro?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.822
That's that way.

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:18.057
So explain to me something.

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:21.193
If it happened this
way, then why are

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:22.661
you over here driving this way?

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:29.969
I was going to the hospital.

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.904
So I think he might be 88.

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:33.038
Here, put that on it.

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.577
Something's weird.

00:14:38.577 --> 00:14:39.278
I mean, yeah.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.913
He's hurt.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:41.981
It sucks.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.082
We all respond a little
differently to it.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.751
But he's pretty out of it.

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.620
So it seems like something a
little different than that.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.624
It looks like there's a knife
in the door panel over there.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:54.660
I don't know what
might be up with that.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.998
He said the injury happened
over there about two miles.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:01.600
But he was going this direction.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.335
So it didn't add up.

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:10.876
It's trashed with
work stuff, alcohol.

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:15.381
I don't know if he uses this car
every day for his personal use,

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:19.251
too, and the company just
doesn't care or what.

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.787
But I mean, like, I
don't know why you'd need

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:24.089
so many condoms in a work car.

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:25.324
Hey, sir.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.525
So have you had any of that
alcohol that was sitting

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:28.360
on the passenger floorboard?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.228
No.

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.796
It was there Thursday.

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.164
Was there Thursday?

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:33.799
There's one of the
beers was still open,

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:36.735
or was open and had
a liquid in it still.

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.971
So you just roll around
with an open container

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:41.440
for a couple days?

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.675
No.

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:44.643
I have no idea.

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:45.978
It was there on Thursday.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:51.450
I was going to clean it out,
but my leg started swelling,

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.120
and I was getting to
the hospital right now.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.789
OK.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:00.025
He has thick, slurred
speech, red, watery eyes.

00:16:00.025 --> 00:16:01.760
I mean he's starting to get
the build-up right here.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.761
[inaudible]?

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.129
He's kind of
slobbering on himself.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.564
I didn't get real close to him.

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:06.665
So if it is, it's faint.

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.334
But also, I poured
that beer out,

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:11.203
so I kind of smelled it already.

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:13.972
Aaron's going to go check on
the driver back at the hospital

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:15.741
once he gets there.

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.944
And then try a little quieter,
more controlled environment,

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:21.180
try to figure out if he
thinks he's impaired or not.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.848
He's already got some
suspicions of it,

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.850
but obviously wants
to confirm it.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.453
So he's not under
arrest at this point.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:28.620
Aaron's going to
go to the hospital

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.423
and talk to him a bit more.

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:33.158
Then he'll find out
for sure over there.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.775
10-4.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:55.180
We have to go re-lodge
this storm drain.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.216
That should be quite a task.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.717
These storm drains are
actually pretty heavy,

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:02.154
so I don't know if I'm
going to be able to do it.

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.857
You seen a storm drain
loose around here?

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.058
Yeah, right over on there.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:06.925
Right over here.

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:16.935
Yep.

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:17.536
Oh, that's not good.

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:24.643
303.

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:27.479
303.

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:29.548
Can we get somebody
from highway out here?

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:33.919
There is a giant hole right in
the middle of the playground.

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:37.456
It looks like the cover
was pushed into the bottom

00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:38.056
of the storm drain.

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.361
10-4.

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:44.329
Do you think you
could lift that up?

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.764
I don't know.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:48.033
Think you can?

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:50.569
No, there's nobody in there.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.870
What's that?

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.738
I said, are you about to
head in there or something?

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.639
We're going to
have to, and try

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:54.840
to get that cover out of there.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.175
You want us to help you?

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:57.776
Think you can?

00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:58.610
I guess.
Yeah.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.778
All right, we'll see.

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.313
If I can get it
out-- what's that?

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:02.848
Did it fall in, like
all the way down there?

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:03.782
Yeah, you see it?

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:05.717
See it all right there?

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.986
Looks like someone pushed it in.

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:09.721
Has it been like that since
you guys have been here?

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:10.556
I think so.

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:11.256
Really?

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:12.424
[inaudible].

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:13.325
No, I'll go in.

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:14.026
I'll go in there.

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:14.726
I'll go in there.

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:15.661
You sure?

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.029
Don't get bit
by no alligators.

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:19.131
Hopefully not.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:20.566
Oh, my god.

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.835
[inaudible]

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:29.808
[inaudible].

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:33.212
304.

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:34.980
Responding to the fire.

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.420
Yeah, that's not
going to happen.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.589
I don't think I'm going to
be able to get that out.

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.457
It's pretty heavy.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:48.760
Two little kids go
down there [inaudible]..

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.695
No.

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:53.131
Nobody go down
there, god forbid.

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.533
I'm telling you.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:56.702
That thing weighs like a small
Volkswagen. It's pretty heavy.

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:57.402
It's all cast iron.

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:58.704
It's pretty heavy.

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.506
What if we all just grabbed
the grate and pull it out?

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:01.206
[bleep]

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:01.907
You think we could?

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:02.674
Probably.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:03.609
Who's my strongest guys?

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:04.443
Him.

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:05.477
I'm going to guess him.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.945
I'm going to guess him.

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:07.746
[inaudible]

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:09.047
Do you think you're strong?

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:14.119
[interposing voices]

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.988
It's definitely these two.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.089
You think so?

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.690
You guys think we can
MacGyver something?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.758
Huh?

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:20.792
Do you guys even
know what MacGyver is?

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.528
Oh, probably not.

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.129
[inaudible]?

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:25.397
[interposing voices]

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:36.475
Pull it up.

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.175
Pull it up.

00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:39.144
Ready?

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:41.079
Oh, Oh.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.548
Yeah, J.J.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:44.383
[interposing voices]

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.356
So the trick is you
put it on diamond,

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.258
then you turn it so
it doesn't fall in.

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:53.859
There you go.

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.298
Oh.

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:02.301
Look at that,
community teamwork.

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:04.303
Thank you, guys.

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:04.903
Appreciate it.

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:10.609
All right, well,
able to get it--

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:12.744
get the storm drain back
in with a little help

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:16.248
from the community.

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:20.452
So job well done.
