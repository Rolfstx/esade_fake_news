00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.710
this was the Spanish flu of 1918 the
deadliest pandemic of the 20th century.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.370
Epidemics have infected societies
throughout history. Usually epidemics

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.470
come and go but some truly stand out for
their viciousness. In recent history

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.630
there has been no pandemic more
devastating than the flu of 1918.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.180
Sometimes called the Spanish flu or
swine flu it killed about 675 thousand

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.130
in the United States alone. The outbreak
came in the midst of World War one and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.160
the flu would actually kill more troops
than combat. The flu of 1918 was so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180
deadly it killed more Americans than
World War 1, World War two,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.989
Vietnam, Korea, and the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan combined. Yet the Spanish flu

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.890
was horrifying for even more reason. It
was very contagious and it killed

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.620
extremely quickly sometimes in as few as
12 hours. It killed people in the prime

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.589
of their lives but the most victims
being young healthy people aged 20 to 40.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.189
Additionally, it killed some of its
victims in bizarre brutal ways

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.810
completely unlike a typical flu virus.
Some symptoms actually closely resembled

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.250
the plagues which killed millions in the
Middle Ages. But scientists have analyzed

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.020
the pathogens genome and verified it was
not black death which killed millions in

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.560
1918. It was just the flu. This video will
cover how the flu began and how its

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.479
spread across the world, the bizarre
symptoms that made it so deadly,and how

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.530
the flu pushed society to the very brink
of collapse.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.479
If the epidemic continues its
mathematical rate of acceleration

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.830
civilization could easily disappear from
the face of the earth within a few weeks

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.430
Victor Vaughn, surgeon general of the Army, October 1918. No one can be absolutely

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.140
sure where the pandemic originated but
there are several theories. In northern

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.590
France there was an outbreak of a
flu-like disease at a British military

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.140
base in 1917. The base was located in a
swampy area with lots of waterfowl and

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.400
pigs. New flu epidemics often arise when
people have close contact with sick

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.840
birds or pigs. There was a separate
outbreak of respiratory disease among

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.380
soldiers from Southeast Asia who fought
in World War one from 1916 to 1918. Most

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.790
flus start in Southeast Asia and some
historians argue the soldiers may have

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.310
brought a new virus to Europe, but
historian John Berry makes the case in

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.810
his fascinating book "The Great Influenza",
that the flu may have originated on a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.420
farm in rural Kansas by jumping from
infected pigs to humans. Indeed the first

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.530
officially recognized cases of the
Spanish flu emerged at a military base

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.360
in Kansas. The US had just entered World
War one and training and industry had

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.760
ramped up at a rapid pace as the war
machine fired up, but in rural Haskell

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.280
County, Kansas, a war of another type was
quietly beginning. Haskell County was in

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.560
the grip of a deadly outbreak of what
seemed to be a mysterious new disease.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.459
People in the community farmers mostly
may have caught the new disease when a

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.519
pathogen
from sick pigs jumped species and began

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.799
infecting humans. The new virus, the swine
flu, was shockingly contagious and

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.640
extremely deadly. A local doctor was
terrified by the death toll the new

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.200
virus and contacted the US Public Health
Service for advice. His concern was noted

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.030
but nothing else was done. After all it
was a tiny rural backwater. How could it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.890
spread far in such a sparsely populated
area? Slowly the virus began to die down

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.420
as it ran out of new people to infect. Perhaps it would have stopped there had

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.190
the times been different but 1918 was
the perfect breeding ground for a

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.379
worldwide pandemic.
In early 1918 every military base was

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.609
teeming with young men training for war.
The military hurried to build new

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.629
barracks, hospitals,training areas and
facilities to support the influx of

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.159
hundreds of thousands of men. Some of
these men were volunteers and some had

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:11.290
been drafted. The strange new disease was
just dying down in Haskell County when a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.660
few young men left there headed to camp
Funston, Kansas, for training. Camp Funston,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.419
located at modern-day Fort Riley, was
already over-capacity, with 56,000 young

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.620
men training for war. There hadn't been
time to build enough barracks for all of

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.930
them. It was the coldest winter on record
east of the Rockies yet many men were

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.550
sleeping in tents without any heat and
only thin blankets. In an effort to keep

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.870
them all warm the commander ordered all
the men to move into barracks ,violating

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.110
the health and safety rules that
dictated how much space each soldier

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.120
should have. Inside the barracks men
huddled around stoves trying to keep

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.190
warm. The men from Haskell County must
have crowded in close too, even as they

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.500
began to cough and sneeze. That's all it
took. In the overcrowded barracks, the flu

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.440
spread rapidly. It only took six days for
the outbreak to begin. The men from

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.570
Haskell County arrived on February 28th.
Less than one week later men began

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.419
flooding into sick call. Within just a
few weeks the flu swept across the base

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.650
sickening thousands and killing between
38 and 50. It was a high death rate for

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.000
the flu but it was nothing compared to
what was coming next. The virus was about

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.460
to mutate and become much much worse. Flu viruses are constantly mutating and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.240
sometimes there will be a really big
shift or a virus that usually affects only

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.380
animals mutates so it can infect
people too. When that happens it can be

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.030
very deadly. The flu comes in waves.
That's why we have a flu season. Although

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.229
it may seem like a bad flu is done the
flu can hide for a while or go infect

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.400
people in a different part of the world
and then return even worse. In the case

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.139
of the 1918 flu, three waves of flu
devastated the world. The first wave

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.999
wasn't too bad but the second and third
waves were extremely dangerous.

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.619
The outbreak at Camp Funston came just
at the end of the flu season in the

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:10.299
United States, so the first wave infected
a lot of people, but then faded away. The

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:13.719
military wasn't worried. They were
grappling with the far more deadly

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.639
outbreak of measles at the time. The flu
virus seemed to fade away but really it

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.999
just went abroad to take on a world at
war. "It stalked into camp when the day

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:29.649
was damp and chilly and cold with the
hand that was clammy and bony and bold;

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:34.389
and its breath was icy and moldy and
dank, and it killed so speedy and

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.939
gloatingly greedy that it took away men
from each company rank." The Flu, Private

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:46.929
Josh Lee, 1919. Nearly all the ships
carrying American troops to war arrived

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:52.329
at the port in Brest, France. In April of
1918 just as the flu outbreak was dying

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:57.099
down at Camp Funston,an epidemic began
in Brest and slowly began spreading

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:01.629
throughout northern France. Despite the
illness spreading in the city more and

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:06.729
more troops poured in. Healthy men would
land, become infected and then ship out

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:10.419
to new duty stations and to the
frontline carrying the disease through

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.769
every small town and hamlet through
which the armies traveled. The flu tore

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:18.069
across France and followed the
frontlines into Belgium and the

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.029
Netherlands. It jumped across the lines
of war and began infecting the German

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:26.259
army, actually affecting the outcomes of
battle since so many troops who were too

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.969
sick to fight . It jumped from the German
army to the German people. By May it had

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:34.089
reached Italy where it crossed the
Mediterranean and surged into North

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:38.979
Africa. It also arrived in England by May
riding back on boats with troops heading

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:45.219
home. Infection and death rates began to
skyrocket in Spain and Portugal. The flu

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:49.569
gained its name, the Spanish flu, from the
early infection and high mortality rate

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:55.089
in Spain, where a reported eight million
died in May. Spain was neutral in World

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:58.839
War one and as a result it was one of
the only countries that was reporting

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:03.249
the news without strict government
censorship. Most countries didn't want to

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:06.669
reveal to their enemies that they were
battling an epidemic and didn't want to

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:10.240
affect their people's morale so the
government's pressured the media to hide

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.770
and downplay the severity of the virus.
However in neutral Spain

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.699
the press was free to report the news
accurately. Newspaper headlines in Spain

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:22.690
screamed of an epidemic that was killing
millions while other countries only

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.680
whispered of the flu. The world believed
the flu was worse than Spain when

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:33.909
in actuality Spain was the only one talking
about it at first. The flu continued

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:39.099
spreading beyond Western Europe. By July
it had jumped to Scandinavia and Greece.

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:42.700
The same month, the flu crept its way into a tense Russia where the Tsar and his

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.089
family had just been executed and the
Bolsheviks were battling with other

00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:50.770
factions to see who would control the
future of Russia. A boat filled with sick

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.180
sailors arrived in Mumbai, India, at the
end of May. At first a few dock workers

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.709
reported sick then workers at the next
docks became ill and then men at the

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:04.930
nearby warehouses got sick and so on
into the city. Ships left those same

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.670
infested docks and spread to other ports
in Asia. Sick people boarded trains in

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.270
Mumbai and spread the disease like
wildfire along the railroad lines up

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:18.640
into the subcontinent and continental
Asia. The flu showed up in China around

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.380
the same time, spreading inland from a
dock in Shanghai. By June, it had arrived in

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.520
Singapore, a world trade hub where the flu
infected the dock workers and spread to

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.520
the local population from the bustling
docks.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.970
Sailors carried the flu south into
Indonesia and north into Malaysia and

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.649
Thailand where it continued to spread. By
July, it had reached sub-Saharan Africa

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:43.270
with infected sailors who arrived at the
ports. It entered West Africa from ships

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.290
arriving in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It
infected eastern Africa via the port in

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.329
Mombasa, Kenya. Ships arriving into Cape
Town set the virus loose in South Africa.

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:57.339
From these ports, influenza ripped its
way across the continent devastating the

00:09:57.339 --> 00:10:02.260
population. By July it had also reached
Peru and begun spreading across South

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.570
America. By August it had returned to
North America. By October it had reached

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.310
New Zealand and Japan. By November, a lethal outbreak was surging across Colombia,

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:17.200
Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.
Despite quarantines on ships entering

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.149
port, dock restrictions and a concerted
effort at containment, it finally spread

00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:27.390
into Australia by 1919 . In less than a
year the deadly flu had surged

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.400
around the world. The flu was able to
spread so efficiently for many reasons

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.480
including the movement of vast companies
of troops around the world and the

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.330
conditions those troops were living in.
World War 1 was desperately brutal and

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.860
trench warfare made for horrific living
conditions and for the perfect breeding

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.210
ground for disease. Men lived out in the
open with no protection from the

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.220
freezing winter the pounding rain or the
sweltering sun. Troops at the front lines

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.600
lived in filthy trenches for months at a
time where they had to eat, sleep and

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.340
answer all the calls of nature within
close contact with each other. When it

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.000
rained the trenches filled up with water
that became rank and foul as it had

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.260
nowhere to drain. Men's feet rotted in
their boots, a condition called trench

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.900
foot. Dead bodies lay decomposing in
no-man's land between the two armies.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.070
When it rained, water would wash
excrement, decomposing body parts and

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.450
filth down into the trenches where the
men lived. Constant bombing turned up the

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.430
dirt and turned the ground into a sloppy
swamp .The mud became so bad that in some

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.960
places it was like quicksand .Planks were
laid down for the men to walk on. There

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.610
were cases of horses, pack mules and even
soldiers slipping off the walkways and

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:47.100
drowning in the mud before they could
struggle out of their heavy gear. By the

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.480
end of the war over 9 million combatants
and 7 million civilians would die

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.970
thus it's not surprising that when a
violent new virus arrived it became an

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:03.090
even more deadly foe than the enemy
soldiers. At some point in the summer of

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:08.190
1918 the flu mutated to become more
deadly. It gave some people the normal

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.900
symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, aches
and diarrhea and many got sick then

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.190
recovered like a normal flu. Some were
sick longer or died after catching a

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.510
secondary infections such as pneumonia.
However many people became violently ill with

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:27.150
strange symptoms. In fact in the July
1918 edition of the medical journal "The

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.830
Lancet", doctors argued that this strange
epidemic couldn't be the flu because the

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:37.770
symptoms didn't fit. Italian doctors
argued the same. In some people Spanish

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.360
flu caused fevers that were so high
people hallucinated.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.980
Some writhed in agonized muscle
pain so bad that doctors thought they

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.649
had dengue, also called "break-bone fever".
It made some people temporarily or even

00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:56.170
permanently blind, deaf or paralyzed. Some
lost the ability to smell. Some had

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.860
strong vertigo and would fall over if
they tried to walk. Extreme ear

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.240
infections developed very quickly going
from the first pain to the eardrums

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.709
rupturing within only a few hours. Some
had terrible headaches and double vision.

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:15.579
Severe mucus excretions and inflammation
made it hard for victims to breathe some

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:19.600
people coughed so hard they tore their
abdominal muscles. Doctors doing

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.860
autopsies saw lungs so damaged that they
resembled those of people who died from

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.709
poisonous gas in the war. Some people
developed a symptom most physicians had

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:33.820
never seen before. Tiny puffs of air would leak out from

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.200
tears in the lungs and get trapped beneath
the skin puffing up in little pockets

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.700
all over their bodies. When they moved
the pockets would crackle like a bowl of

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.680
rice krispies according to one nurse.
Some people developed hemorrhagic fever

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.589
which, like Ebola, causes its victims to
bleed. An army report described the flu

00:13:53.589 --> 00:13:59.050
as a rapidly escalating infection and
lungs choked with blood, fatal in from 24

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.250
to 48 hours. Some people bled from their nose, their

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:09.579
ears and their eyes. Some people with the
1918 flu became so oxygen starved they

00:14:09.579 --> 00:14:14.560
began to turn blue or even looked black,
a condition called cyanosis. People

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.709
reportedly turned so dark that it was
difficult to distinguish white people

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:22.510
from people of color. For this reason the
flu picked up the nickname "the blue

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.949
death" and many wondered if the black
death had returned. When people began

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:32.560
turning blue doctors knew they wouldn't
survive more than a few hours. The flu

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.699
was also terrifying because it could
kill so quickly. Many victims died within

00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:41.800
a day or two or even hours of showing
their first symptoms. According to a

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.790
story recounted in the book "The Great
Influenza", a man in Cape Town, South

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.949
Africa, boarded a streetcar just as a
conductor died. During the three-mile

00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:53.880
ride to his house, six more people on the streetcar died.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.360
When the driver died, the man got off the
streetcar and walked home.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.690
"We've had a number of cases where people were perfectly healthy and died

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.650
within 12 hours."
Charles Edward Winslow, epidemiologist

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:13.740
and professor at Yale University. In late
summer of 1918 the flu virus returned to

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:19.080
America but this time it was far more
deadly. In August, a ship full of sick

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.370
people arrived in a New York City from
Europe. Four men had already died at sea

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.530
and 200 more people on the ship were
sick. Many were taken to hospitals but

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.160
they weren't quarantined. In the
following week several more ships full

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.090
of sick people arrived. The same was
happening in other deep-water ports like

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.860
Boston, Philadelphia and New Orleans. At the same time as the virus was arriving and

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.660
spreading in ports, ships left those same
ports headed for Canada, Central America,

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:51.690
the Caribbean and South America, carrying
infected people. In early September there

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:56.280
was an outbreak at Navy Pier in Boston.
The pier was quarantined but officers

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.900
still moved between bases. An officer was
probably responsible for carrying the

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.300
flu to nearby Camp Devens. At first, just
a few men reported sick and then within

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.280
only a few days an epidemic broke out. By
mid-September, thousands of men were sick,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.290
in many cases violently so. Of those who
were sick, seventy-five percent were so

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:21.300
ill they had to be hospitalized. The
sheer number of patients overwhelmed the

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.110
medical staff of the military hospital.
The hospital had been designed to treat

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:31.790
a maximum of 1200 troops at one time, yet
more than 6,000 patients were crammed in.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.900
Cots were stuffed into every available
space, in hallways and offices, even on

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.820
outdoor porches. The doctors and nurses
fell ill and there were simply not enough healthy

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.080
people to care for the thousands of sick
people. So many died that they couldn't

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.980
all fit in the hospital morgue. The dead
were stacked up one on top of another

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.330
like firewood in the hallway outside the
morgue. Every day they were carted away

00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:00.600
and every day the hall filled up again. The Army Medical Officers issued an

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.880
order that no men should be sent to or
shipped out of camp Devens.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.010
However that's not what happened. A group of officers left camp Devens headed to

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:15.589
Camp Grant in Illinois. Despite the rules
against it, the chief officer there had

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:20.000
authorized overcrowding due to a
shortage in barracks, once again giving

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.709
the ideal environment for the disease to
spread. Shortly after arriving the

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:28.220
officers from camp Devens became sick. The men were quarantined but it was

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.750
already too late. Within two days of the
first cases, the flu was widespread

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:38.150
throughout the camp. Within four days of
the first case, men started dying. Within

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:43.580
five days, doctors and nurses became sick
and started dying. By six days there were

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.450
4,000 men admitted to the hospital and
they converted ten barracks into

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.290
temporary hospitals. By seven days they
were running out of medicine,

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.820
disinfectant and other medical supplies.
By nine days they converted nine more

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.810
barracks to serve as hospitals, bringing
the number up to twenty. They didn't have

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.160
enough beds sheets or ambulances to
carry all the infirm. When they ran out

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.430
of beds, soldiers were ordered to
stuff straw into sacks to use as

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.120
mattresses for the sick. They still
didn't have enough. They tried to make

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.990
enough face cloth to cover people's
mouths to fight the spread of germs but

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:20.330
they ran out of cloth. The Red Cross set
up a station to notify relatives that

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.740
their loved ones were dying or dead. Now
relatives poured into the midst of a

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.820
deadly epidemic. Healthy relatives were
escorted by coughing service members to

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:33.080
identify dead bodies in the morgue. They
crowded into the overfilled hospitals to

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.030
visit loved ones. Desperate parents and
wives tried to bribe nurses and

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.930
orderlies to give special care to their
soldier. It became such a problem the

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.920
head officer issued a warning about
accepting bribes. Those relatives would

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.910
leave the camp and carry the infection
out into the civilian community, into

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.290
local towns, on to cross-country trains,
and ultimately back to their own

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:59.270
hometowns. Civilian health officials
called for an emergency quarantine of

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:04.370
Camp Grant, but the virus was already out.
Four days after the first reported case,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.540
a trainload of troops had left Camp
Grant to go cross country to Camp

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.670
Hancock near Augusta, Georgia. For the
journey of almost 1,000 miles,

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:18.140
the men were packed tightly into train
cars with poor ventilation. In the tight

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.020
quarters, men coughed and became feverish.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.310
They infected each other swiftly and the

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.210
virus swept along the train. The train
stopped repeatedly along the journey to

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.140
refuel and the men who could still walk
got off the train to get a break from

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.670
the hacking coughs of the sick and
delirious men. There they interacted with

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.390
railroad workers and curious locals
who'd come to see the troops. They

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.520
infected town after town for almost
1,000 miles. When they finally arrived in

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.440
Georgia, 2,000 of the 3,000 men were so
sick they needed to be hospitalized

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.690
immediately. They started a new outbreak
at Camp Hancock. Historians don't know

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.260
how many of the men from the train died
but one report from Fort Leonard Wood

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.730
claims 10%. Yet when hundreds began dying, the medical staff at the hospital

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.690
stopped keeping careful records. They
were just too overwhelmed by all the

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:15.530
dead.  "One robust person showed the first
symptoms at 4 o'clock p.m. and died by

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:23.450
10 o'clock a.m." The Journal of the
American Medical Association. The same

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:28.700
thing would happen at bases across
America. At Camp Custer in Michigan, 2,800

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.040
troops reported sick in a single day. At
the same time, hundreds of thousands of

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.240
troops were still shipping out to Europe.
By this point the government knew how

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.010
dangerous the flu was so they tried
to contain the virus on ships. Visibly

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.490
sick men were not allowed on the ships
but this didn't make much difference in

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.690
the end. The flu virus incubates for a
few days before any signs of infection

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.580
are visible. On board the ships, the men
were locked into their bunk rooms for

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.360
most of the voyage across the sea. Armed military police enforced the

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.550
segregation. On most ships about 400 men
were locked into each crowded bunk room

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.810
in cramped quarters with little
ventilation. Although the troops were

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.380
segregated from others in the ship, they
still shared the same mess hall where

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.980
they all ate. They would file through
breathing the same air and touching the

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.660
same tables and chairs as the group
before. On one ship called "the Leviathan",

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.580
the flu broke out almost immediately
despite the quarantine efforts. Within

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.750
two days it had overwhelmed the ship's
medical services. The doctors and nurses

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.200
were laid up sick alongside their
patients

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.670
delirious, coughing and blood pouring
from their bodies. The blood pooled on

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.000
the floor and the nurses who were still
well enough to work walked through the

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.800
puddles leaving bloody footprints on the
deck. Finally there were so many sick men

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.470
that they began laying them on the deck
of the ship out in the elements.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.640
They even lay there in storms because
the well were too overwhelmed to move

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:57.190
them and the ill were too sick to move
themselves. At first the deaths came

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.000
spaced apart and the officers took
careful notes in the captain's log of

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.470
the Leviathan. At first, they wrote the
date and time of death, the name and rank

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.820
of the deceased, their unit and cause of
death, but only one week after leaving

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.250
New York, the officers were so overwhelmed they

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:16.810
wrote only name and time of death. The
captain's log shows two deaths at 2:00

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:25.000
a.m., one at 2:02 a.m,. two at 2:15 a.m. It
continued like that around the clock. The

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.810
healthy must have been terrified, locked
onto a ship filled with a deadly plague

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.640
with nowhere to escape. They began
burying men at sea. At first they were

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.160
solemn ceremonies, but after so many the
funerals became routine. They would read

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:48.970
a name, say a brief prayer and slide the
body off the boat, then on to the next. The same was happening on every boat.
carrying troops across the ocean medical

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.720
Advisors begged the military to stop the
troop movements, but the war machine

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.430
needed men. At the same time, it was
infecting the civilian population from

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.620
port to port, and along the railway lines.
However the very worst outbreak probably

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.460
occurred in Philadelphia and it was made
immeasurably worse by mismanagement

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.170
by leaders who ignored warnings from public health doctors. Had public health

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:15.070
measures been implemented, perhaps much of the death and suffering could have

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:20.950
been avoided. Philadelphia in 1918 was
teeming with people.Hundreds of

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.220
thousands had swarmed the city because
of the new job opportunities working at

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.140
steel plants, docks, railroad yards and
industries that supplied the war. Without

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.610
enough housing for the influx, poor
people were crowded into squalid, filthy

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:37.450
slums that lacked indoor plumbing.
Multiple families would cram into one

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.310
apartment and share an outhouse in an
alleyway with hundreds of people.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.519
Sometimes people shared not only
apartments but beds,

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:49.350
even sleeping in shifts. The boarding
houses would rent out beds for six or

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:54.029
eight hours at a time. When one worker
woke up to go to work, another worker

00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:59.159
would get into the newly vacated bed and
sleep, same sheets and all. The streets

00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:03.059
were notoriously filthy, with rat
infestations and gutters filled with

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:07.610
trash, animal and even human feces. With
people living in overcrowded conditions,

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.029
exhausted from hard labor and weak from
poor nutrition, dirty water and bad air

00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:18.059
quality, it was a perfect breeding ground
for an epidemic. "I had a little bird its

00:24:18.059 --> 00:24:23.809
name was Enza. I opened the window and
in-flu-enza." Children's jump-roping song,

00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:30.600
1918. A ship full of sick sailors arrived
into the Philadelphia Navy Yard in

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.480
mid-September. Within a few days, the Navy hospital was overrun and the Navy began

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.250
sending sailors to civilian hospitals in
the city. As sailors began dying, the flu

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.940
spread to civilians. Two days after the
first sailor arrived at the hospital,

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.620
multiple doctors and nurses felt fine as
they started their shifts yet collapsed

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:54.360
and became desperately ill within hours.
However, the health board for the city

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.570
didn't want people to panic.
They downplayed the severity of the

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:01.950
disease. After the death of several
sailors and civilians, the Health Board

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.580
confidently declared the disease had
reached its zenith and already begun to

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:11.549
decline. It hadn't even gotten started. At
the same time, the federal government was

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:15.659
desperate for money from war bonds to
fund the war. People would buy bonds,

00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:19.139
essentially loaning the government money
for a promise of being paid back later

00:25:19.139 --> 00:25:24.120
with interest. Every city had a quota of
bonds they had to sell and Philadelphia

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.860
was ready to hold the Liberty Loan
parade to sell war bonds. Public health

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.519
doctors begged the city to cancel the
parade, terrified that it would cause the

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:37.289
outbreak to become an epidemic. The city
government ignored them. On September

00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:41.490
28th, hundreds of thousands of people
jammed into the downtown streets to

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:46.440
watch the parade. In that huddled crowd
all crushed together, it only took a few

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:53.879
coughing, sneezing people to launch the
epidemic. Within seventy-six hours, just

00:25:53.879 --> 00:25:57.620
three days later, the city's 31 hospitals
had run

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:02.540
out of bed space. They were completely
full. Some hospitals tried to cram in

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.980
more by laying patients on cots in the
hallways, in offices, and outdoor balconies.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.450
In some cases the sick were laid on the
floor next to a dying patient. Once the

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.900
patient died the body was taken away and
the new patient would be lifted into the

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:20.030
same bed, still warm from the previous
occupant. The city opened several

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:24.830
temporary emergency hospitals but it
wasn't enough. Hospitals started refusing

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:30.110
to accept any more patients. People lined
up outside, begging to be let in. Some

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:35.270
died standing in line. Even for those who
got in, care was non-existent for most

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.770
people. The hospitals ran out of medicine.
The doctors and nurses were overtaxed

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.780
and they were dropping from the flu. They
were desperate for help. People with no

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:49.030
medical training volunteered. Physicians
and nurses came out of retirement.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:53.390
Medical schools closed and first-year
medical students were put in charge of

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:57.350
an entire floor of a hospital. One
medical student reported that during the

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:01.760
height of the outbreak, one-fourth of all
the patients in the hospital died every

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:07.910
day. Nurses were so overtaxed they began
adding toe tags to the living so they

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.260
could tag several at once. Once a patient
turned blue it was only a matter of

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:17.150
hours to death, so they felt confident in
tagging them. Sometimes there wasn't any

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:21.590
time for an intervention some people
died within 24 hours of contracting the

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.670
flu. A nurse that Mount Sinai Hospital
started her shift in the morning and

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:32.510
suddenly fell ill. She died 12 hours
after first feeling sick. The number of

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.410
dead kept growing. Five days after the
city held the Liberty Loan parade,

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:41.020
city leaders finally acted. The Health
Department banned all public meetings.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:45.440
Churches schools and theaters were
closed. They left the bars open but

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.700
those too were closed the next day. The
courts closed and city services shut

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.870
down. It took only a few days for the
city's operations to completely grind to

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.970
a halt. Within just 10 days, Philadelphia
went from a few hundred cases of flu and

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:03.140
a couple deaths per day, to hundreds of
thousands of people sick and hundreds

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.340
dying every day, all because they ignored
public health guidelines.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:13.700
By three weeks after the parade, the
death toll stood at 4500. So many died

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.080
that they couldn't be buried fast enough.
Grave diggers were sick or refused to

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.010
bury flu victims. The bodies started
piling up inside morgues and funeral

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:26.750
homes. Some undertaker's raised their
prices 500 percent to try and cash in.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:32.210
Most ran out of coffins. One funeral home
that hadn't run out, hired guards because

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.870
people were trying to steal the coffins.
People began wrapping their dead in

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:41.540
blankets or sewing together flour sacks
to use as shrouds. No one came to take

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.080
the bodies and there was nowhere to
bring them so the dead stayed in the

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.490
homes. People wrapped them in blankets
and set them in closed off rooms. The

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:54.500
bodies were laid on porches or stacked
in back alleys. In the poor, overcrowded

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.610
tenement houses where multiple families
lived in one apartment, there were no

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.450
porches or spare rooms to put the bodies.
They set them in the corners or stacked

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:06.490
them in the alleyways next to the shared
outhouses and drinking water pumps.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.880
Sometimes people were so sick that the
person in bed next to them would die and

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.870
they couldn't gather the strength to
take the body away. The city began to

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:18.190
smell, the stench of death hanging
heavily in the air.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:25.370
Finally families begin digging their own
graves to bury their dead. Everyone was

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:29.960
terrified. People avoided each other.
There were cases of children whose

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.170
parents got sick and the children
starved because no one would go near

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:37.670
them in case the child was sick. This was
particularly a problem since those who

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.800
were most likely to die were people aged
between 20 to 40, many of them parents.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.740
People couldn't get food because no
trucks were delivering goods in the city.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.310
The streets fell silent. Every business
was closed. People hid inside their homes.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:57.650
The street cars stopped. The police cars
stopped. The entire city ceased to

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:01.650
function.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.150
"You were constantly afraid. You were afraid because you saw so much death
around you.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.660
You were surrounded by death.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.320
When each day dawned you didn't know
whether you would be there when the sun

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.770
set that day. It wiped out entire
families from the time that the day

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:17.620
began in the morning to bedtime at night,
there wasn't any single soul left."

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.636
William Sardo, Washington, D.C.

00:30:20.636 --> 00:30:24.820
The Philadelphia city government was by now non-functional.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.450
Wealthy Philadelphia
families appealed to the federal

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:34.310
government for help but there was no
help to send. Cities all across America

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.580
were buckling beneath the weight of the
epidemic, and the federal government was

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.230
busy managing the outbreak on military
bases and among troops in Europe. With

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.980
the city government failing to act, the
women of elite Philadelphia families,

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.210
many of the same who'd organized the
Liberty Loan parade, banded together to

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.710
start outreach efforts. They gathered
together civic leaders from across the

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.730
city to start planning. They set up a
special hotline to answer questions

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:02.300
about the flu, but had a hard time
keeping it staffed because so many

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.750
employees were sick. They set up local
neighborhood leaders who would organize

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.950
distribution of food and medical care.
They set up soup kitchens in the schools

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:15.170
and food delivery to sick people when possible. Five hundred people volunteered their

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.830
cars to be used as ambulances and to
deliver food and drive doctors around to

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:22.640
treat the sick. However there was a
desperate need for more volunteers and

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.140
most people were too afraid to get
involved. Leaders begged for more help

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:32.410
but people turned away. The fabric of
society began to break down.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:36.470
City leaders, who hadn't bothered to
attend meetings of the outreach effort,

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:40.880
finally got involved. They seized the
city's emergency fund to pay for

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.110
supplies and pay health workers. They
opened additional morgues and sent out

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.670
policemen to try and clear the piled-up
bodies. Like the ancient plagues, people

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:53.360
carried their dead out to the streets.
There the bodies were loaded onto open

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.160
trucks or horse-drawn wagons. There were
no coffins, so they stacked them one on top

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.420
of the other. Also like in the days of
the plague, they stopped trying to bury

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.710
people individually and began digging
mass graves where hundreds of bodies were

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.000
dumped in. The city used construction
equipment to dig long trenches and push

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.269
the bodies in. Someone would stand by the trench say a

00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:20.480
prayer and then the steam shovels would
push dirt over the piles of bodies. By

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.200
late October, the epidemic was finally
beginning to loosen its death grip on

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.980
the city. In its aftermath it left a
death toll of 13,000. It also left

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.059
thousands of orphaned children, a
shortage of food and goods, and a stalled

00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:39.820
city that had to slowly grind its most
basic services back into motion.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:47.000
Finally, it left a changed people, filled
with fear, wearied by war and disease, and crushed by grief.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.620
"The people of Phoenix are facing a crisis. Almost every home in

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:56.380
the city has been stricken with the
plague." Arizona Republican (newspaper), November 8th, 1918.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:04.100
In other cities and towns across
America the news was the same. In New

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:10.700
York City, 33,000 people died before the
statisticians stopped counting. Some

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.870
small towns tried to keep the virus out
by quarantining themselves. They shut down

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.799
all businesses and canceled public
gatherings. People were ordered to stay

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:22.880
in their homes and not touch or visit
others. Some towns made it illegal to

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.380
shake hands. In other towns, police were
dispatched to nail signs on the doors of

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:33.139
homes where people were sick. The signs
said "influenza" in red letters. Rumors

00:33:33.139 --> 00:33:38.029
spread in Phoenix, Arizona, that dogs spread the disease. Policemen killed dogs in the

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:43.490
streets and people killed their own pets.
Towns in Colorado set up barricades on

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.720
the roads and men guarded them with
shotguns, preventing anyone from coming

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.679
in. Other towns couldn't stop the trains
from rolling through on their local

00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:56.600
platforms but they refused to let anyone
step off the trains. Anyone who did was

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.799
thrown in prison and quarantined. It
didn't work. The virus still slipped in.

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:06.110
The only place major city that escaped the worst of the wrath was San Francisco, and

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:10.099
historians credit that to aggressive
response by the local government who

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:13.669
listened to their public health
officials. Public health director William

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:18.980
Hassler quarantined all naval stations
before they had any reported cases. He

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.659
knew it was only a matter of time. He
ordered all public schools and gathering

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.950
places closed. He divided the cities into
separate districts with distinct support

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:32.990
staff, so as to segregate outbreaks. He
laid out plans and organized the flu

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:36.790
response before the flu ever hit the
city, so they would be ready when it did.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.450
The city's government, medical and civic
organizations banded together to educate

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:45.589
citizens on prevention such as
hand-washing, avoiding public places and

00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:49.429
wearing a face mask. While Philadelphia's
government was still denying there was a

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:57.079
problem, San Francisco authorities were
distributing 100,000 face masks. Police

00:34:57.079 --> 00:35:01.670
enforced the facemask rule at gunpoint
and actually shot people who refused to

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.079
wear masks in the streets. As the second
wave diminished throughout the country,

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:12.200
San Francisco rejoiced for having missed
the flu. The fluid would mutate once more and

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.530
rage through the world for a third time but
infecting and killing fewer people. This

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:23.150
time, it would be less severe. This time
it did hit San Francisco because they

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:26.839
thought the flu was already over. The
third wave hit the South, West and

00:35:26.839 --> 00:35:33.170
Midwest hard, but for the rest of America.
the worst of the flu had passed. Even as

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:37.310
America woke from the nightmare, the
epidemic had left its imprint. Right at

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.240
the height of harvest time, farmers had
been too sick to farm and workers didn't

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:45.109
show up to gather the food in. Food that
was harvested rotted in warehouses

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:49.310
because there was no one to transport it.
There was a lag while the country tried

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:53.030
to catch up on shipping food and goods
and store shelves and markets stayed

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.930
empty for some time because goods hadn't
been delivered. As winter rolled in,

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.680
there was a shortage of coal and other
goods. However the weary country still

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.030
rejoiced for an armistice was signed on
November 11th 1918.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:11.869
The war was finally over even as the
plague and its effects lingered on. In

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:18.410
the US, it killed about 675 thousand. The
flu killed an estimated 3 percent of the entire

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:23.180
world population. In Latin America, the
flu killed 10 out of every 1,000 people.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:29.210
In Africa, about 15 out of every 1000
died, and in parts of Asia, the death rate

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:34.760
was as high as 35 per thousand. In Tahiti,
it killed ten percent of the population,

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.350
and in Western Samoa,
20 percent of the population died.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:44.710
In India alone, it killed about 20
million people. You may be asking

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:49.420
yourself, could a deadly flu like that
happen again? It's important to

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.540
understand that the Spanish flu was
devastating for a number of reasons

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.710
unique to that time. However, the
essential formula for epidemic still

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.430
exists. Viruses sometimes jump species, for instance

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:04.510
from pigs to humans. This could
happen at any time anywhere in the world,

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:10.480
and of course flu viruses are constantly
mutating. Usually mutations are minor but

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.500
occasionally a big mutation can happen.
This has happened a few times in recent

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.300
history. For instance the Russian flu of
1889 killed about 1 million people, the

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.200
Asian flu of 1957
killed about 2 million and the Hong Kong

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:29.950
flu of 1968 also killed about 2 million.
Then in 2018, exactly 100 years after the

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.210
outbreak of Spanish flu, the mutation
brought a particularly deadly flu to the

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:41.710
US and Australia. As of 2018, there is one
strain of Avian flu, an h5 type, that has

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:47.020
managed to infect humans, but so far it
cannot jump between people. However, that

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.980
particular strain of flu is frightening
in its potential, according to Donald

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.000
Burke, MD, former director of the Johns
Hopkins Center for Immunization Research.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.280
Of the people who have been infected, it
has been deadly in over 75 percent of

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.870
cases. If that type of flu adapted to
human-to-human infection, it could be

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:10.150
catastrophic. So could it happen again? Yes, it could.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:14.800
As Burke said, "When it comes to the
probability of a pandemic flu, I think

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.310
everyone would say it's not if. It's when."
However there's reason to be hopeful.

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:25.890
When a new kind of flu emerged in 2009, a
swine flu just like the Spanish flu,

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.970
officials did not waste any time
acting. Public officials acted swiftly,

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:35.830
putting emergency epidemic plans into
operation. We were lucky that the 2009

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.510
swine flu, though very contagious, was not
a deadly strain, and it showed us that

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:45.490
response matters a great deal. In fact,
the way we respond to the next big

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.700
epidemic could mean the difference
between life or death.
