00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
your question because it allows me to

because of our slope of our curve to

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:13.340 align:start position:0%
South Korea those curves were
 

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.850 align:start position:0%
South Korea those curves were

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
accomplished and still the winter season
and<00:51:16.040><c> so</c><00:51:16.880><c> we're</c><00:51:17.120><c> trying</c><00:51:17.390><c> to</c><00:51:17.630><c> understand</c><00:51:18.380><c> what</c>

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:18.890 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to understand what
 

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.860 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to understand what
those<00:51:19.040><c> relationships</c><00:51:19.310><c> are</c><00:51:20.150><c> we're</c><00:51:20.600><c> very</c>

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:20.870 align:start position:0%
those relationships are we're very
 

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.750 align:start position:0%
those relationships are we're very

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
interested in the curves in Italy
 

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
interested in the curves in Italy
because<00:51:23.660><c> of</c><00:51:24.110><c> their</c><00:51:24.860><c> different</c><00:51:25.250><c> approach</c><00:51:25.670><c> and</c>

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
because of their different approach and
 

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.730 align:start position:0%
because of their different approach and
we're<00:51:26.120><c> following</c><00:51:26.330><c> every</c><00:51:26.690><c> single</c><00:51:27.230><c> country's</c>

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:27.740 align:start position:0%
we're following every single country's
 

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.550 align:start position:0%
we're following every single country's
curves<00:51:28.070><c> and</c><00:51:28.370><c> so</c><00:51:29.060><c> all</c><00:51:29.510><c> we</c><00:51:29.750><c> can</c><00:51:29.900><c> do</c><00:51:30.050><c> is</c><00:51:30.200><c> look</c><00:51:30.410><c> at</c>

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
curves and so all we can do is look at
 

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.970 align:start position:0%
curves and so all we can do is look at
prior<00:51:30.910><c> coronavirus</c><00:51:31.910><c> and</c><00:51:32.150><c> prior</c><00:51:32.980><c> respiratory</c>
