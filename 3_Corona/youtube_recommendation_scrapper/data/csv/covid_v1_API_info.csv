Tom Cruise’s fascination with doing extremely dangerous and crazy stunts is part of what makes the Mission Impossible films so successful. Each entry amps up the intensity and forces the audience to question the star’s sanity. Most of these stunts can be done with CGI, but that’s the cheap and easy way out according to Tom Cruise, who would rather risk life and limb to get the best stunt for the film. For instance, he’s learned some pretty advanced military skills in order to do scenes in the franchise, including being the first actor to do a HALO jump on screen for Mission Impossible: Fallout and learning how to deep dive with professional divers for an extended underwater sequence. He opened up Mission Impossible II with a daring cliff climb at Dead Horse Point in Utah, where he scaled the rocks with only a thin safety cord-no nets and no crash mats. He brought it up with Ghost Protocol and scaled the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa. He strapped himself to the side of a plane as it took off, supported only by a harness, battling the speed and the winds. The knife to the eye in MI2 was actually done for real-with a real knife because, why not at this point. Measurements were taken to make sure Cruise didn’t lose an eye in the process. He’s driven motorcycles without helmets at breakneck speeds, including in the city streets and on open highways. Most amazingly though, he learned to fly a helicopter for a mountain aerial chase scene in Mission Impossible-Fallout.

A new poll by ABC News poll found that 72 percent of Americans are in favor of the stay-at-home orders and believe that if we move too quickly back to our normal will present a greater threat to our country. 

86 percent think that the social distancing and shelter in place orders are responsible policies. 

If restrictions were lifted immediately, about 80 percent of Americans say that they will more than likely continue to avoid public places that draw crowds.

Wim Hof Breathing guided by Wim Hof himself explained with the science behind it. Please always learn from the source, and have the facts right.

- Don't take the method and techniques too lightly, they go deep and the effects can have a huge impact.
- Don't do the breathing exercises in a swimming pool, before going underwater, beneath the shower or piloting any vehicle, without proper supervision. Always practice in a safe environment.
- Keep in mind to do the exercises without forcing them, gradually build up and don't exceed your limits.

Love, strength and happiness to everyone!

In 1991, MJ and the Bulls took down Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers to win the franchise’s first NBA championship. (1:43) Chicago defended its title in 1992 by defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in a series that featured Jordan’s famous “Shrug Game.” (3:20) The Bulls completed their first three-peat with a victory over Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns in 1993.

After Jordan’s return from baseball, (5:07) the 1996 Bulls won a then record 72 regular-season games and topped the Seattle SuperSonics in the Finals. (6:41) MJ’s “Flu Game” in 1997 helped the Bulls to victory over the Utah Jazz, and in the dynasty's (8:33) Last Dance in 1998, Chicago completed its second three-peat by defeating Karl Malone, John Stockton and the Utah Jazz yet again.

Wim Hof inspired.","For FAQ about the type of freezer, how to set this up, gear used etc. see pinned first comment. Over the past years I have been experimenting with a lot of different ways to start your day, what works and what doesn’t work. A good morning routine makes you feel in control and this sets the tone for the rest of your day. 

For the first hour of my day I will make it a clear point to NOT get on my phone. Instead I focus every day on meditation, Wim Hof Method inspired deep breathing, journaling, ice baths and a few other routines. This 3 minute video shows the first 30 minutes of my day. 

Full details with benefits about each practice can be found on my blog: http://extramilest.com/blog/my-morning-routine

********** SAFETY WARNING - Please don’t do anything stupid. Always make sure to unplug the electricity before going in. Do not do the Wim Hof breathing exercise in water, while driving or in other critical situations. If there is a short loss of consciousness, this can be deadly! Ease into cold exposure and don’t stay in too long. One way to start out is by taking cold showers and transitioning from there to short ice baths. ********** 

This is my morning routine for most days of the week, some days I start my routine after my early morning run. Setting aside 30 minutes in the mornings will positively influence the rest of your day. Consistency is key in developing a morning routine that works for you and actually sticking to it. Meditation, deep breathing, gratitude journaling and cold therapy bring me tremendous health benefits, physically, mentally and spiritually. 

If you are developing your own morning routine, I suggest trying different things for several days and asking yourself “how am I currently feeling”? Write down your experiences and use tools like the Fitbit to track body markers such as resting heart rate, sleep stages, etc over time to notice differences. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself, start for example with a 5 minutes daily meditation for a week. Be kind to yourself and have fun!

What morning routine have you used or are you looking to start with? Please let me know in the comments below!

Nos meteremos, literalmente, en sus zapatos, en su forma de trabajar y en las múltiples disputas que tuvo a lo largo de su vida.

Conoceremos las particularidades de su mente gracias al Neuropsicólogo Marcos Ríos y las de su legado, tanto en Estados Unidos como en los Balcanes, en boca del Director del Museo Tesla de Belgrado, Vladimir Jelenkovic. Todo ello, repasando su vida gracias a un comic exclusivo dibujado para ConCiencia por Pedro Quijano.

Y repasaremos la huella que la figura y la obra de Nikola Tesla ha dejado en el cine, la literatura, el comic, los videojuegos y la cultura de internet. Porque nuestro mundo no sería hoy el que es de no haber existido alguien como Nikola Tesla.

My friends, I am Lyadov, and I am in China doing my vlog. Right now, I intend to go to the Hubei Province, which as many of you already know is described as the source of the coronavirus. This is where the city of Wuhan is, where the coronavirus story started. I want to see how the people there are living. 

Don’t get me wrong. I am not crazy. I studied the medical side of the issue quite carefully, so I know what I am doing. The most difficult part now is not the virus, but the Chinese police.

First of all, the Chinese have one of the world’s most vigilant police forces. 

Presently, they are being especially careful to catch anyone who films anything at all in the proximity to the Hubei border. // So, let’s see what becomes of this.

All my aviation highlights of this year are included in this video, like a few Airbus A380`s, Boeing 747` s and even a Tupolev TU-154. It was a splendid year with lots of interesting aviation highlights and I would like to thank all of you for watching my aviation videos in 2019. I hope to see all of you again in 2020.

I filmed all of these clips at various airports in Europe, like Düsseldorf, Cologne, Frankfurt, Liege, Maastricht, Skiathos, Hamburg, Amsterdam and many more. My personal highlight of the year was the Tupolev 154 which visited Cologne on a special mission. Another highlight was the Boeing 747-400 of Kuwait Airways which landed at Enschede Airport in the Netherlands. It was the last flight of this Boeing 747 and now, 7 months later the B747 is already gone.

USS GEORGE H.W. BUSH (CVN 77) will be ready to conduct sustained Carrier Strike Group operations and independent carrier operations and directed by command authority to support national objectives.

Our Priorities
First and foremost, USS George H. W. Bush (CVN 77) is a warship designed to provide adaptable and decisive combat power to our national leadership. We have many critical non-combat capabilities and responsibilities – they are all important. We will enthusiastically embrace and excel at any assigned mission but our ultimate benchmarks will always be combat readiness and combat effectiveness.

Our Guiding Principles
Like our namesake, we serve our country with integrity, dignity, and humility.
Mission excellence is achieved through ownership and personal responsibility.
The material condition of our ship is critical to mission effectiveness.
Sailors and their families are our most important asset.
Naval Service is a team sport.

That said, plenty of footage here of this epic show.

He’s the founder of Rich Global LLC and the Rich Dad Company, a private financial education company that provides personal finance and business education to people through books and videos. He has authored over 26 books on finance!

His book series Rich Dad Poor Dad is an international bestseller. It compares his two “dads”: one was his poor biological father and the other was his ‘fictitious’ rich dad.

Rich Dad Poor Dad has become the #1 bestselling personal finance book of all time! His newest book is Who Stole My Pension?: How You Can Stop the Looting.

Robert has seen his fair share of failures and has learned some tough lessons in business. Some of these lessons are hard to teach unless you live through them. Today on The School of Greatness, Robert shares some of his wisdom he’s learned through experience and how you can make money during a financial recession.

In Dr. Joseph's TEDx Talk, he explores self confidence and how it is not just the most important skill in athletics, but in our lives.
 
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","2012-01-13T20:11:50.000Z","UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q","TEDx Talks","19234476","318167","5406","0","6222","People & Blogs"

These surprising tactics—which radically diverge from conventional negotiating strategy—weren’t cooked up in a classroom, but are the field-tested tools FBI agents used to talk criminals and hostage-takers around the world into (or out of) just about any scenario you can imagine. 

In NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It, former FBI lead international kidnapping negotiator Chris Voss breaks down these strategies so that anyone can use them in the workplace, in business, or at home.

En el mundo de los superhéroes, especialmente los de la mitología nórdica, los accesorios son fundamentales. Thor tiene varios: su larga capa roja, su largo pelo rubio y su poderoso martillo Mjolnir. Su martillo, es tan duro e irrompible, que se necesitó el poder de Hela, la diosa de la muerte, para romperlo en Thor: Ragnarok. Pero parece ser que detrás de cámaras no es tan resistente como debería.

Una de las pocas cosas tan icónicas como el martillo de Thor en el UCM es el escudo de Capitán América. Es uno de los accesorios más clásicos, y es tan poderoso que puede romper paredes y cerraduras. Desafortunadamente, resulta que el escudo no es tan fuerte como todos pensábamos.

Anteriormente ya lo había entrevistado -al menos, una vez- en todos y cada uno de sus programas. Incluso le dedicó una serie completa, ""Trece noches"", en la que el único invitado era el maestro cordobés. La diferencia de esta entrevista con todas las demás estriba en que, en esta ocasión, Antonio Gala habla desde la enfermedad --está gravemente enfermo- por lo que sus palabras, en tono de despedida, suenan más rotundas y más verdaderas. Quizá porque intuimos que estamos en la hora de las verdades del barquero. El mismo título del programa, ""No os molestéis, conozco la salida"" --título elegido finalmente por Gala para su muy esperada y poco probable autobiografía- da idea del carácter testamentario de estas declaraciones. El Gala más rebelde, más iconoclasta, más desengañado, más duro y más auténtico, el que sin retórica llama a los sinvergüenzas sinvergüenzas y abomina de esta España en que la gente se suicida porque la echan de sus casas, se ofrece ""casi desnudo, como los hijos de la mar"", en esta entrevista, que sin duda supone un documento y un testimonio de indudable valor. El programa se enriquece con divertidos, ingeniosos, poéticos y profundos fragmentos de otras entrevistas anteriores hechas por Jesús Quintero a Antonio Gala. En definitiva, una charla de dos viejos amigos en la hora de la verdad, donde el mejor Antonio Gala brilla esta vez por su cruda sinceridad y su valentía.","2013-04-03T22:49:19.000Z","UCKYg8jenhdzj65DcdL9gBdQ","ratonescoloraos","544896","4466","358","0","525","People & Blogs"

Te cuesta encontrar trabajo. Así que no es muy sorprendente que muchas celebridades hayan perdido sus millones, incluso si aún trabajan activamente. Estos son algunos famosos que quebraron en el 2019.

Los problemas económicos no son nada nuevo para Toni Braxton. Según ABC News, la cantante de ""Unbreak My Heart"" se declaró en bancarrota dos veces, una vez en 1998 y otra vez en el 2010, e incluso consideró posar para Playboy para aliviar sus deudas. Casi una década después, parece que Braxton atraviesa problemas financieros una vez más. 

Según The Blast, el Estado de California y el gobierno federal presentaron cuatro embargos fiscales contra ella en el 2018, el mismo año en que lanzó su noveno álbum de estudio. Se presume que la cantante debía más de $780.000 en impuestos atrasados del 2015 y 2016, pero sus problemas no terminaron allí.

Durante su separación de Birdman en el 2019, E! News informó que el gobierno y el Estado de California presentaron embargos preventivos adicionales porque Braxton presuntamente debía casi medio millón de dólares en impuestos atrasados del 2017.

Aunque parece que comenzará el 2020 con grandes deudas, al menos puede contar con el dinero que gana en los reality shows. A pesar de una breve pausa por problemas de contrato en el 2018, Braxton Family Values regresó a WeTV para otra temporada en el 2019.

Según TMZ, Braxton y sus hermanas han sido contratadas hasta una novena temporada, así que esperemos que eso la ayude a mejorar su situación financiera.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told CNN that we are very unlikely to see sports or concerts again until 2021, with researches at Harvard estimating that we could be social distancing until 2022.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""","2016-03-30T02:54:04.000Z","UCJ0uqCI0Vqr2Rrt1HseGirg","The Late Late Show with James Corden","84251995","846613","18336","0","44986","Entertainment"

Esta segunda parte de las reacciones reales de los actores se pudo realizar gracias a TODOS los comentarios que me han dejado. Muchísimas gracias a todos.

Como en la primera parte de este video, hemos hecho una compilación de escenas... algunas divertidas y otras no tanto, donde vemos las reacciones reales de los actores. Ya sea culpa del director o simplemente la planeación de la creación de la película, algunos actores se han llevado los sustos de su vida o unas muy buenas risas, que fueron los momentos perfectos para que la película terminara siendo una de nuestras favoritas.

It didn't take long to learn that even celebrities aren't immune to coronavirus, as several high-profile actors, athletes, and politicians tested positive.

Although she'd been practicing social distancing at her home in London, Marianne Faithfull still came down with a cold. To that end, in order to take sensible precautions, the iconic singer checked herself into the hospital to get herself tested for COVID-19 — and received a positive diagnosis.

In addition to being diagnosed with COVID-19, Faithfull also developed pneumonia, which can be a complication of the virus. Furthermore, because Faithfull is over the age of 65, she's especially vulnerable to complications of coronavirus, according to the CDC.

On April 3, 2020, musician Christopher Cross took to the internet to reveal that he'd tested positive for the coronavirus. He wrote in a Facebook post,

""I'm not in the habit of discussing medical issues on social media. But I do so in hope this will help other people to understand how serious and how contagious this illness is.""

He added that this was perhaps the worst sickness he'd ever experienced.

The Grammy-winning artist then implored people not to fall for conspiracy theories or to spread the idea that COVID-19 is a hoax. He also advised people to follow the protocol set forth by the CDC in order to stop the spread of the virus.

Watch the video to see which other celebs were unfortunately diagnosed with coronavirus.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""","2018-07-27T03:16:22.000Z","UCJ0uqCI0Vqr2Rrt1HseGirg","The Late Late Show with James Corden","37169880","642032","9821","0","25086","Entertainment"

What would happen if, tomorrow, every single person on Earth simply disappeared? Not dead, simply gone, just like that. A world without people, where city streets are still populated by cars, but no drivers. A world where there is no one to fix bridges or repair broken windows…

After being on the receiving end of humanity for millennia, nature would finally be given a chance to take the world back.

But how would it work? How long would the skyscrapers and houses last if they were abandoned? How would suburban pets fare without people to feed them? How would the forests, the oceans and the wildlife react if there was suddenly an end to all the hunting, fishing and farming?

“Aftermath” is the astounding story of a world that humans will never see. The two-hour special examines the impact of human beings on this planet by proposing what the Earth might be like without people.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""","2020-04-16T06:21:00.000Z","UCJ0uqCI0Vqr2Rrt1HseGirg","The Late Late Show with James Corden","533325","13261","120","0","849","Entertainment"

Los días de efectos especiales prácticos quedaron atras. Al menos, los días en que los efectos prácticos eran la principal fuente de magia visual en las películas. Hoy en día, los estudios de cine pueden usar modelos y maquetas, pero casi siempre recibirán ayuda de efectos especiales digitales. Estas imágenes generadas por computadora, o CGI, están diseñadas por artistas de casas de efectos especiales como Industrial Light and Magic de George Lucas o WETA de Peter Jackson. Y aunque los ojos de la audiencia aún pueden detectar inconsistencias o momentos de falsificación visual, los cineastas detrás de los efectos especiales en la pantalla siempre encuentran nuevas formas de sorprendernos.

Sin embargo, por cada momento de asombro en StarWars, Avatar o las películas de los Vengadores, también hay casos en que los efectos especiales sobresalen, y donde nosotros, como audiencia, podemos darnos cuenta. Es en estas fotos y filmaciones detrás de escena que podemos ver actores con trajes de captura de movimiento, celebridades famosas en trajes monocromáticos e imponentes antagonistas capturados con disfraces torpes y simplistas. Claro, todos estos disfraces de aspecto tonto se arreglarán en la edicion, pero por ahora podemos disfrutar de lo torpes que realmente son antes de agregar los toques finales.

Únase a De Pelicula a medida que avanzamos en estas 10 instancias donde los actores fueron vistos en el set sin la ayuda de efectos digitales. Están Chris Evans en Capitán América, Zoe Saldana en Avatar, el elenco de la serie El Planeta de los Simios, Benedict Cumberbatch en el Hobbit, Peter Cushing en RogueOne, Ryan Reynolds en Deadpool, la capa en Superman, y Andy Serkis en… ¡prácticamente todo!","2020-02-01T19:45:01.000Z","UCOWKssYVOxWXFn7AhkOJdjw","De Película - By Screen Rant","1741583","16851","1120","0","354","Entertainment"

Stephen Colbert took over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced ko<U+028A>l'b<U+025B><U+0259>r, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

<U+0001F517> https://openload.co/f/3YwxOM1ELnE

=================================================

<U+2139> del Vídeo: Te contamos cómo engañó Kirk Douglas a los actores para grabar ‘Espartaco"" y varios datos desconocidos sobre la grabación de la película ‘Espartaco’ y su protagonista y productor, Kirk Douglas, acaba de cumplir 102 años de edad por lo que hacemos un breve repaso a su vida.

<U+0001F4DD> SINOPSIS de la película Espartaco:
Película no recomendada a menores de 13 años
En la Libira del Imperio Romano, un esclavo llamado Espartaco (Kirk Douglas, Cautivos del mal) conoce a Léntulo Batiato (Peter Ustinov, Quo Vadis?), un rico mercader de esclavos poseedor de una escuela de gladiadores en Capua. Después de ver el talento del esclavo decide comprarlo para sumarlo a su lista de gladiadores. Tras ser adiestrado como tal, por el severo ""doctore"" Marcelo, y enamorado de otra esclava llamada Varinia (Jean Simmons, Hamlet), a la que mandan a Roma, lidera una revuelta que une a todos los esclavos de Batiato, los cuales destruyen la escuela hasta las cenizas.

La revuelta ha llegado a oídos del Senado de Roma, quien no piensa tolerar tal afrenta de los esclavos. Mientras en la capital se decide qué hacer, Espartaco va ganando afines a su lucha, ganando las batallas contra las tropas romanas. En uno de esos descansos, consigue encontrar a Varinia, cuyos destinos se vieron separados al marchar ella a Roma. El Senado da la orden a Glabro de atacar a los esclavos, pero descuida las defensas de su propio campamento, y en un contraataque es vencido y humillado.

Roma empieza a ver que la revuelta que lidera Espartaco es algo a tener en cuenta, y que han de pararla cuanto antes para evitar que cunda el ejemplo en el resto del Imperio. Al final es el general Marco Licinio Craso (Laurence Olivier, Los niños del Brasil) el encargado de hacer frente a las tropas esclavas en la batalla del Río Silario, donde finaliza la revuelta. Espartaco consigue sobrevivir, pero es crucificado junto al resto de esclavos en las afueras de Roma.

She starts by following The L.A.Times' homeless data map, and sets out to have conversations with people who do not have homes. Since October, Biagiotti has been learning about their varied experiences and connecting their stories to larger issues. Along the way, she gains input and insights from Angelenos.

The world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others.

But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors.

In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany’s decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.’s decision to only test symptomatic cases.

Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany’s less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors.

“I think so far we’ve been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,” he told CNBC Thursday.

President Donald Trump, who put a hold on WHO funding yesterday, isn't absolved of his own failures in confronting COVID-19. But there's no doubt that the WHO's response destroyed much of its credibility, damaged the field of public health, and failed to contain the pandemic.

The WHO's actions in response to COVID-19, in part, stemmed from its overly deferential stance towards China, which is its second-biggest financial contributor among 194 member states.

""A phenomenal collective action by the people of China to this response"" is how Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-China mission, described China's handling of the outbreak on February 25, 2020, a day after WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised China's ""rapid response,"" which he claimed ""changed the course of this epidemic.""

The WHO also praised China for releasing the virus's genome while neglecting to mention that it took them at least 17 days to do so. It didn't report human-to-human transmission until late January—even though Chinese doctors suspected it at least a month earlier. Although the extreme lockdown of Wuhan likely saved thousands of lives, WHO scientists weren't allowed into Wuhan until 3 weeks after the outbreak first came to light, leaving open many questions about measures the government took in the interim. Meanwhile, the WHO praised the country for its supposed openness.

""China took action at the epicenter, and that helped prevent the spread to other provinces and the rest of the world,"" Ghebreyesus said on February 15. 

""As China has shown, this does not need to be a pandemic if we take action,"" WHO Executive Director Michael Ryan said on February 28. 

As the virus continued spreading across Europe and reached America, the WHO recommended ""no interference with international travel.""

One country that ignored this advice was Taiwan, which also warned the WHO that it suspected that the virus was spreading through human-to-human transmission, yet was ignored. Taiwan, which has one of the lowest rates of known COVID-19 infections per capita, was prevented from joining the WHO as a member country in 2015 by China, which refuses to acknowledge Taiwan's independence.

In late March, World Health Organization epidemiologist Bruce Aylward declined to answer a Hong Kong reporter's question about Taiwan—or even acknowledge its existence.

As Taiwan was distributing face masks to its citizens, the WHO was advising the rest of the world that they were unnecessary—and initially, the Centers for Disease Control and U.S. Surgeon General followed its lead.

But health experts pointed to mounting evidence that masks can help slow the spread of respiratory disease, especially among asymptomatic carriers, a population that the WHO maintains is virtually nonexistent despite mounting evidence to the contrary.

In mid-February, the WHO trumpeted good news from  China, claiming confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 had declined, ignoring evidence that it may have been a statistical anomaly. U.S. intelligence, meanwhile, believes that China has entirely misrepresented both case numbers and death tolls, according to Bloomberg News.

Finally on March 11, after Italy was already in full national lockdown with more than 10,000 cases, the WHO finally acknowledged the true magnitude of the crisis, declaring a global pandemic.

As the death toll climbs above 100,000, the global economy remains in crisis, and billions of lives are disrupted, it's important to remember that if the World Health Organization had done its job, the nightmare we're living through might not have happened at all.

"481","25","Mg8Du_gNm3o","PT3M24S","false","hd","How much do you know about Kim Yo-jong & Hyon Song-wol of North Korea","Kim Yo-jong, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s only sister is drawing attention as she stood right in the front at a welcoming ceremony for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Pyongyang. Kim, who was born as the daughter of Kim Jong-il and Ko Yong-hui in 1988, is said to have a close relationship with her brother Kim Jong-un, due to shared isolated years while studying together in Switzerland from 1996 to 2000. Seoul’s National Intelligence Service confirmed that she now seems to be on the same level as the likes of Choe Ryong-hae, who firmly holds onto his role as the de facto No. 2 man in the country. On the other hand, Hyon Song-wol, head of the North’s Samjiyon Orchestra and the Moranbong Band, seemed to take over Kim’s previous role in protocol. Therefore, some even say that Kim Yo-jong and Hyon Song-wol are the most powerful women in North Korea today.

“Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened,” U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a statement.
Horowitz released his report Monday saying his investigators found no intentional misconduct or political bias surrounding efforts to launch that 2016 probe and to seek a highly controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in the early months of the investigation. Still, it found that there were ""significant concerns with how certain aspects of the investigation were conducted and supervised.""

“I have the utmost respect for the mission of the Office of Inspector General and the comprehensive work that went into the report prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff,” Durham said. “However, our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department. Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.”

As Horowitz has conducted his review of DOJ actions during the Russia probe, Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, has also been conducting a wider inquiry into alleged misconduct and alleged improper government surveillance on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

Fox News reported in October that Durham's ongoing probe has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation.

Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr ripped the FBI’s “intrusive” investigation after the release of Horowitz’s review, saying it was launched based on the “thinnest of suspicions.”

“The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,” Barr said in a statement.

Barr expressed frustration that the FBI continued investigating the Trump campaign, even as “exculpatory” information came to the light.","2019-12-11T18:29:53.000Z","UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg","FOX 10 Phoenix","175792","2182","150","0","856","News & Politics"

"538","25","Le_rfTdayLs","PT54M18S","false","hd","1st documentary movie on the origin of CCP virus, Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus","As the world is gripped by the ongoing pandemic, many questions remain about the origin of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus—commonly known as the novel coronavirus.

Join Epoch Times senior investigative reporter Joshua Philipp as he explores the known facts surrounding the CCP virus and the global pandemic it caused.

In his investigation, Philipp explores the scientific data, and interviews top scientists and national security experts. And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.

Editor's note:

From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""

Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.

As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself—in 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.

In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts’ opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.

Some of our viewers felt the documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.

Cuomo reported 438 new deaths in the state in the past 24 hours, which he said was “still breathtakingly tragic.”

He also announced that the New York State Department of Health will be partnering with Attorney Gen. Letitia James to begin investigating the state's nursing homes for potential violations of executive orders that were implemented during the outbreak. The executive orders include requiring communication with families on COVID-19 test results and deaths

The preliminary ""Phase I"" results of a COVID-19 antibody test conducted within New York State were also revealed. Cuomo reported that out of a sample size of 3,000 people, 13.9 per cent of individuals tested positive for having antibodies, and 21.2 per cent of people tested within New York City had virus antibodies.

He clarified that these individuals were previously infected with the virus, and developed the antibodies to fight it.

According to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University, New York has more than 263,000 cases and over 14,800 deaths from the novel coronavirus.

In 2014, the world avoided a horrific global outbreak of Ebola, thanks to thousands of selfless health workers -- plus, frankly, thanks to some very good luck. In hindsight, we know what we should have done better. So, now's the time, Bill Gates suggests, to put all our good ideas into practice, from scenario planning to vaccine research to health worker training. As he says, ""There's no need to panic ... but we need to get going.""

The TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and more.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In South Korea, citizens have flattened the curve of the novel coronavirus -- and it's because of lessons they learned from fighting the MERS outbreak in 2015. Through a combination of aggressive and widespread testing measures, along with a system know as “contact tracing,” they’ve been better positioned to spot the path of the virus and curb its spread. While they are still vigilant for a second wave of Covid-19 cases, people in South Korea are slowly returning to public life. Watch the video above to find out how their testing and contact tracing measures work, and how it can be a lesson for countries still in lockdown.

China's Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern history. It spans over 60 countries and will cost over a trillion dollars. The plan is to make it easier for the world to trade with China, by funding roads, railways, pipelines, and other infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa. China is loaning trillions of dollars to any country that's willing to participate and it's been a big hit with the less democratic countries in the region. This makes the BRI a risky plan as well. But China is pushing forward because its goals are not strictly economic, they're also geopolitical.

In the video, we see the racist customers getting owned by employees, specifically the manager.

Kim Jong-un seemingly decided to tone down the display after his professed commitment to denuclearisation following his summit with Donald Trump.

Instead nearly half of the parade was devoted to civilian efforts to build the domestic economy, emphasising the leader's new strategy of putting economic development front and centre.

Kim attended the morning parade but did not address the assembled crowd, which included the head of the Chinese parliament and high-level delegations from countries that have friendly ties with the North.

Senior statesman Kim Yong Nam, the head of North Korea's parliament, set the relatively softer tone for the event with an opening speech that emphasised the economic goals of the regime, not its nuclear might.

After a truncated parade featuring tanks, fewer than the usual number of missiles and lots of goose-stepping units from all branches of the military, along with some students and others, the focus switched to civilian groups, ranging from nurses to construction workers, many with colourful floats beside them.

Although North Korea stages military parades almost every year, and held one just before the Olympics began in South Korea in February this year, Sunday's parade came at a particularly sensitive time.

Kim's effort to ease tensions with President Trump have stalled since their June summit in Singapore.

Both sides are now insisting on a different starting point - Washington wants Kim to commit to denuclearisation first, but Pyongyang wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement formally ending the Korean War.

With tensions once again on the rise, a parade featuring the very missiles that so unnerved Trump last year, and led to a dangerous volley of insults from both leaders, could be seen as a deliberate provocation.

The North displayed its latest missilery in the February parade, however, and Washington hardly batted an eye.

Soon after the Sunday celebrations end, Kim will once again meet in Pyongyang with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss ways to break the impasse over his nuclear weapons.

The ""new line"" of putting economic development first has been Kim's top priority this year. He claims to have perfected his nuclear arsenal enough to deter US aggression and devote his resources to raising the nation's standard of living.

The world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others.

But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors.

In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany’s decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.’s decision to only test symptomatic cases.

Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany’s less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors.

“I think so far we’ve been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,” he told CNBC Thursday.

Andrew Cuomo has pounded the importance of testing more fervently than anyone in America. He went to Washington, D.C. to nail down a federal-state partnership with President Donald Trump and said the meeting was productive. But once you've tested hundreds of thousands of people, how do you trace their contacts to prevent a future surge of infections?

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has volunteered to help develop and implement a regional contact tracing program, a ""massive undertaking"" that will propel the tri-state area toward reopening, Cuomo announced Wednesday.

He said the program, which will be supported by $10.5 million from Bloomberg and developed in partnership with Johns Hopkins' researchers, will be regional in its approach because ""the virus doesn't stop at jurisdictional boundaries.""

The effort will require an ""army,"" Cuomo said. While planning is still in the works, he says about 35,000 SUNY and CUNY medical students will be called upon to help. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke earlier Wednesday about a city plan for tracing; Cuomo says any NYC approach will be coordinated with the rest of the state, along with New Jersey and Connecticut, where Gov. Ned Lamont said he will evaluate whether he wants the state to participate and that no formal agreement had yet been reached.

""You cannot trace somebody within the boundaries of New York City,"" the governor said. ""We'll coordinate everyone. This is a monumental undertaking.""

And it's a critical one, particularly to prepare for the possibility of a second wave of the virus, which happened with the influenza epidemic of 1918.","2020-04-23T00:31:52.000Z","UCxCfoSInadl-4i3F70zDt1A","NBC New York","13746","91","9","0","23","News & Politics"

Un trabajo que explica la situación actual de alerta sanitaria en España y en el mundo tras detectarse los primeros casos de coronavirus el pasado diciembre en China.
El famoso poema de Bertolt Brecht Ellos vinieron, en el que el dramaturgo y poeta alemán concluye que si algo no nos afecta, no reaccionamos, da comienzo al reportaje como resumen de lo que parece haber ocurrido en todo el planeta.

“Cuando veíamos que en China se empezaban a tomar medidas, en ningún país del mundo pensamos que nos iba a afectar. Creíamos que era un problema chino y no nos hemos preparado”, asegura el responsable del Área Audiovisual de Unidad Editorial y director del documental, Miguel Toral. “De hecho, en algunos gobiernos, como es el caso de España, quitaban hierro a la enfermedad”, concluye.

En este documental, que se publicará de manera conjunta en las páginas web de los diarios EL MUNDO, EXPANSIÓN y MARCA, se analiza la situación de emergencia sanitaria que viven todos los países del mundo y en especial en España. Se trata de un trabajo que recopila en 40 minutos las mejores imágenes para ilustrar los hitos de esta pandemia histórica, que ya supone la mayor crisis sanitaria del siglo XXI y que lleva aparejada una inevitable emergencia económica como consecuencia de las medidas para frenar el contagio del virus.

Covid-19: el virus que arrasó con todo es un trabajo fundamental para entender lo que ha ocurrido en el mundo durante estos últimos meses en base a las declaraciones de las autoridades sanitarias y miembros del Gobierno en nuestro país, así como del director general de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, Tedros Adhanom, y dirigentes de otros países, como el primer ministro italiano, Giuseppe Conte; su homólogo en Reino Unido, Boris Johson, o el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump.
Asimismo, UEtv ha contado para elaborar este documental con el testimonio de profesionales sanitarios, enfermos por coronavirus y psicólogos que dan las claves para afrontar las circunstancias actuales y encarar las consecuencias en el futuro. Además, Lucas de la Cal, corresponsal de EL MUNDO en Asia, aporta sus crónicas como testigo directo del inicio de esta pandemia en la ciudad china de Wuhan.

Kim Han-Sol is the nephew of North Korean leader Kim Jung Un. Kim Han-Sol's father, Kim Jong Nam, was publicly assassinated by his uncle earlier this year.  He has many different from his uncle but it might be those difference that make it difficult for him to lead North Korea in the future. North Korea recently launched an ICBM in their latest missile test which has further strained US-North Korea relations.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen appeared before the House Homeland Security Committee to discuss the President Trump administration immigration policy on immigrant children, family separation, and detaining children. Congresswoman Rep Nanette Barragan grilled Nielsen on asylym seekers being turned away at the border, even showing video proof to bust Nielsen's lies. Other congresspeople brought up border security, the zero tolerance policy, illegal immigration, migrant children and more. Immigration reform is top of mind for both Congress and the White House, but their approaches to border patrol, ICE, and DHS couldn't be more different.

In Harris County Texas news today, a police officer arrested the wrong man and it was all caught on camera. In this example of racial profiling, Harris County law enforcement approached a Black father outside his home mistaking him for a suspected criminal from Louisiana. Police officers getting owned is not a common sight but these cops (Harris country Texas) were wrong this time. One could argue that this racial profiling short film shows that Black lives matter and more law enforcement training is need to eradicate police bias.

[Full Ver.] Kim's trip to Singapore, from departure to return.
North Korea broadcast Kim's summit in Singapore.
Korean Central Television emphasized the summit scenes including a handshake with Bolton and Trump's car introduction.

On the 14th, the Korean Central Television evaluated the summit that lasted from the 10th to 12th in Singapore as a ""meeting of a century.""
    
This 40 minute video was broadcast around 3:10 pm. Scenes were edited in chronological order from the departure from Pyongyang International Airport to the arrival in Singapore, Trump-Kim Summit, and Return to Pyongyang.

» Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe

Zayd Atkinson, a student at Naropa University, was confronted by an officer while picking up trash for his work-study job outside of his dorm. The officer did not have reasonable suspicion that a crime was occurring and was not entitled to demand Atkinson's date of birth, according to an independent review by a former U.S. Attorney.

Research shows Black people are often exposed to heightened scrutiny and suspicion, which can begin early in childhood. 54% of Black Americans say they felt others 'have been suspicious of them because of the color of their skin,' compared to 6% of white Americans.

Several officers, some with guns drawn, surrounded Atkinson. A college faculty member later appeared to back up Atkinson. The police officers never asked the faculty member, a white man, to confirm his identity or prove that he worked for the college.

After almost 15 minutes, the officer gave Atkinson back his ID and left. The officer resigned two weeks after the incident but will remain on the city payroll until February 2020. An internal investigation found the officer violated 2 department policies but did not conclude he was racially biased.

Precision Wellbeing's Osteopath Ashley Ridout goes into depth as to why most people he sees have shoulder pain.

The most common cause is over-tightness of the shoulder muscles which leads on to the development of tendinitis or bursitis.

In many cases shoulder pain can be overcome through stretching the shoulders with a strength band and using massage balls to reduce the tightness.

In this video Ashley discusses the anatomy of the shoulder including the muscles of the rotator cuff and touches on some of the issues that can arise.

Ashley then goes on to show you the tests that he finds most useful in screening shoulder pain followed by the stretches and massage ball techniques he finds most useful.

This video will hopefully be useful for those who suffer from chronic shoulder pain, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff injuries or just want to simply increase their overall shoulder health.","2017-10-03T17:46:08.000Z","UCwTWYvP51V2B6blkoMN5ztg","Precision Wellbeing Group","2188044","45769","1013","0","1453","Howto & Style"

To avoid common problems some people mostly encounter with these baguettes, follow this standard advice procedure and you won't go wrong.  
1.  Stick to the recipe rigidly, the quantities are very important for successful results
2.  Use scales for the measurements including the water, don't convert to cups or measuring jugs, they are too inaccurate 
3.  Use proper white bread flour with at least 12% protein, check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bag, protein may show in grams per serving but just work it out, it needs to be 12g of protein per 100g of flour, plain or all purpose flour is not strong enough for making bread. 
4.  Check your yeast is working you can do a yeast test as shown in my sandwich bread video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSbYV96_c   
Any problems or inquiries I'm always here to help. And please let me know how you get on with the recipe.

Host of The Daily Show, Noah gained an international audience at the 2012 Edinburgh Fringe Festival with his furiously energetic and hilarious one-man show, The Racist. Now he looks back over the experiences that have fueled his career, charting his coming-of-age in South Africa. Born to a white, Swiss-German father and a black Xhosa mother, Noah was, under apartheid, illegal; after apartheid, as the country came to grips with its past and the chaos of its future, he developed a keen eye for the absurdities of politics, race, and nationalism. If survival is the theme of his book, his mother, the consummate survivor, is its heart, and Noah’s depictions of her fierce Christianity, her savvy hustling, and her determination are as moving as they are funny.

Noah is in conversation with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.

El cerebro es plástico, crece, cambia, se modifica según el entorno, el cariño y la actitud. Aprender de estos temas ayuda a mejorar nuestra vida. Además, podemos aprender a ser felices, o lo más parecido a la felicidad que se alcanza en la tierra. Los estudios respaldan esta teoría, y cuanto antes enseñas a tus hijos, más probabilidades tienes de que tu hijo se enfrente a la vida de la mejor manera posible"" nos cuenta Marian en esta maravillosa ponencia.

En sus campañas, Alejandro Magno demostró la bravía de un digno descendiente de Heracles, y como su también antepasado Aquiles murió a una corta edad –en el apogeo de sus triunfos– y dejó tras de sí una vida llena de glorias que le otorgarían la inmortalidad en la memoria de los hombres, no solo por sus proezas militares sino también por los descubrimientos y conocimientos que aportó a la cultura griega.

Los reporteros Markus Frings y Marco Polo obtuvieron un permiso especial para filmar en el norte de Italia, una de las zonas más afectadas por el coronavirus. Equipados con mascarillas y guantes grabaron controles policiales, siguieron en directo una acción nocturna para desinfectar las calles y entrevistaron a virólogos, empresarios y ciudadanos de la región.
El camarógrafo del reportaje, Marco Polo, nos abrió además las puertas de su casa y nos mostró cómo vive su familia en el día a día sin clases escolares, excursiones o deporte al aire libre. Muchos italianos e italianas están encontrando poco a poco cierta normalidad en esta situación tan excepcional.

Get detailed 3D plans here:  https://kingsfinewoodworking.com/collections/project-plans-for-sale/products/mini-cross-cut-sled-plans

I’ve set up the plans for this project with an optional payment. If you want, you can have them for free. Just use the Discount Code: MINISLED at checkout. It will reduce the price to $0.00.
  
On the other hand, you can choose to pay. If you think the channel has helped you out, and you would like to help support the channel, then you can skip the discount code and pay $2.99 for the plans. This would help us to make more video content. It’s not a whole lot of money, and the plans are high quality.

I have some ideas that I’d really like to teach, like cabinetry for example, but it’s cost prohibitive for me to buy the materials.
 
We do make some money on YouTube with the revenue from videos, but it’s surprisingly little, and doesn’t even come close to covering our materials, & electricity costs for the videos.

I thought we might try this out and see how it works. We certainly don’t mind if everyone gets them for free. We will be just as happy and continue making videos, because we really love to do it. But perhaps this can be an option for people to help contribute to the growth of the channel.

Info on the sled:
This sled is ideal for small parts. There are very few safe ways to cut little pieces safely in a woodshop. With a jig like this, it is much safer. 
This is also the IDEAL sled for a jobsite saw!
This is not a primary table saw sled for a woodshop. But rather a smaller sled to accompany your main one for when the big one is just too big for certain cuts, or when it’s more convenient to grab a lightweight sled.

Por primera vez en la historia de la humanidad, la mayor parte de la población mundial tiene una esperanza de vida superior a los 60 años. Según las previsiones, para el 2050 habrá 2.000 millones de personas en la franja de los 60 años, lo cual supone un incremento de 900 millones respecto al 2015.

Esta aumento de la esperanza de vida ofrece a la tercera edad oportunidades nunca jamás conocidas: realizar los estudios que no pudieron realizar, recuperar aficiones, ayudar a la familia… Pero para esto hay un factor imprescindible: TENER SALUD.

En esta charla repasaremos los factores de estilo de vida, alimentación y suplementación más importantes para conseguir una longevidad saludable.

Hillsdale College is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women “grateful to God for the inestimable blessings” resulting from civil and religious liberty and “believing that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It pursues the stated object of the founders: “to furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education” outstanding among American colleges “and to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.” As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains “by precept and example” the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.","2020-03-05T15:15:22.000Z","UCudqVyQYnmi8NwWfd11Rmvw","Hillsdale College","748039","24430","507","0","4049","Education"

[HOW WOULD YOU ESCAPE NORTH KOREA? (THE 7 CHOICES)]

If you were living in North Korea right now - trying to survive on a diet of rats, grass, soil and tree bark, quenching your thirst by drinking out of mud puddles in the ground - what would you do?

There's also the conceivable chance of being sent to a political prison camp for years on end just because you innocently thought out loud one day to a bunch of friends (North Korean propaganda is strong), where you are then beaten, tortured, and left so hungry that you are forced to dig and consume the grains out of faeces, or the maggots from dead bodies just so you have the energy to perhaps last one more day.

You'd probably wanna escape. But how?

The North Korean government in Pyongyang refuses to let its citizens leave, a clear violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, viewing North Korean defectors as traitorous criminals. Captured North Koreans would be subject to unimaginable torture and often public executions.

If they are successful in their escape, then three to four generations of their family back home would be sent to North Korean prison camps to rot ....or worse. This is a strong deterrent.

But this still doesn't stop desperate North Koreans from tempting fate. In this video, I'll go over the seven ways to escape the DPRK, including the most dangerous, the most unforgiving, the most unique, and the most unexpected.

The North Korean border on the south side (ie. South Korean border / Korean DMZ) is the shortest distance to travel for safety and stability but as a result, the regime makes it dangerously hard. A North Korean escapee can be shot down by North Korean soldiers (border guards) or step on the many landmines in the area.

The northern border to China has it's own set of challenges. Most North Korean refugees escape through this way, usually crossing the Tumen River border (like the famous North Korean defector Hyeonseo Lee). Once in China, the nightmare doesn't end there.

There are also other, more unconventional ways you can try to escape such as through North Korean labor camps.

Even if you make it to safety and resettle in a stable country, the North Korean regime will still try to hunt you down, so you're never truly safe. Especially if you're an outspoken critic or a threat to Kim Jong-un's power - just ask his half brother, Kim Jong-nam.

Una condición que no le impide poseer armas atómicas. A pesar de las sanciones económicas, el país logró recaudar fondos clandestinos para sus programas nucleares y de misiles balísticos. 

La investigación de este reportaje conduce hasta los hombres que ayudaron al dictador Kim Jong-un a diseñar su pérfido sistema.  pesar de las resoluciones de Naciones Unidas, Corea del Norte sigue ampliando su programa nuclear. Pero, ¿cómo lo consigue si está completamente aislado a escala  internacional? Gracias a un sistema pérfido, Pionyang envía cada año millones de trabajadores a más de 40 países. Sus salarios van directamente al erario público de Kim Jong-un. Los únicos que saben cómo funciona este sistema clandestino, son los hombres que ayudaron al gobierno durante muchos años a diseñarlo. El equipo de filmación tardó años hasta dar con estos hombres y sus secretos. En este reportaje atestiguan los hombres de Kim: desde el banquero hasta el embajador, desde los obreros hasta los especialistas que trabajaban en el extranjero y cuyos salarios llenaron las arcas del régimen.

Trebolle pone en relación las identidades judía y cristiana a partir del hallazgo de la comunidad de Qumrán, de cuyos textos se pueden extraer nuevas interpretaciones de las costumbres de los diferentes pueblos judíos y de las diferentes versiones de la Biblia, en especial de los orígenes del Nuevo Testamento.

Fue uno de los delitos de guante blanco más graves de Alemania. Hoy a él mismo le sorprende lo fácil que fue construir una pomposa estructura de mentiras.

Durante años, bancos y empresas de arrendamiento financiero le pagaron dinero a Manfred ""Big Manni"" Schmider, un empresario de Baden, por máquinas que ni siquiera existían. La mayoría de las más de 3.000 máquinas perforadoras de túneles que al parecer se utilizaban en obras de construcción en todo el mundo solo existían sobre el papel. La fantasía criminal de Schmider no tenía límites. Y todo el mundo se dejó engañar: el ""jeque de Karlsruhe"" vivía en un lujo inimaginable, le regalaba diamantes a su esposa, acumulaba mansiones y recorría en helicóptero los diez kilómetros que separaban su casa de su trabajo.
¿Podrían haber detenido antes los políticos y las autoridades financieras el fraude millonario si hubiesen hecho averiguaciones más precisas? Manfred Schmider fue condenado en el año 2000 y pasó años en prisión. Hoy vive en Mallorca.

White hasn't managed to start the attack against the king, black didn't castle, merely playing for exchanges. At some point White's bishop got trapped and young player gave it up and continued playing. Gadir was totally confident that White has anything whne miraculeus queen sacrifice wwas played.

Rapid chess and blitz chess tournaments

Blitz chess (also known as speed or fast chess) is a type of chess in which each player is given less time to consider their moves than normal tournament time controls allow. Openings, tactics and strategy are same.

The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white’s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.

Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.

White not only has to worry about black’s defense but also the counter attack that the Sicilian Defense presents. White tends to have the advantage on the king side while black will usually look to attack on the queen side.

For those chess players that play against the 1.e4 opening quite often, the Sicilian Defense is an opening that you should spend quite a bit of time studying. There are many variations and they each are designed for specific types of players.

EE. UU. Afecta a 43 millones de ciudadanos, el doble que hace 50 años. Puede aparecer rápidamente: una enfermedad o perder el empleo pueden bastar para dejar a una persona en la calle.


En Estados Unidos, muchas personas quedan excluidas del sistema social. Para los habitantes de la región minera subdesarrollada de los Apalaches, ya es casi normal hacer las compras con cupones de racionamiento. Y quien pierde su vivienda no tiene más remedio que vivir en el auto. En Los Ángeles hay tantos indigentes que organizaciones de ayuda han comenzado a construir pequeñas chozas de madera para ofrecerles un techo. También el número de niños sin hogar ha aumentado drásticamente. Ya son 1,5 millones, tres veces más que durante la crisis económica de los años 30, la Gran Depresión. El documental muestra cómo viven las personas pobres en los Estados Unidos de hoy.

ANTES DE CAMBIAR TU DIETA MIRA ESTO","Muchas veces, por dolor abdominal, malestar digestivo o distension, cambiamos nuestra dieta. Pensamos que el problema radica en lo que comemos, sin pensar en otras posibilidades, COMO ESTAS:

ALERGIAS ALIMENTARIAS
LAS ALERGIAS ALIMENTARIAS SON REACCIONES EXAGERADAS DE NUESTRO SISTEMA DIGESTIVO FRENTE A ALIMENTOS QUE INGERIMOS
PODEMOS DETECTAR ALERGIAS A TRAVES DE TEST ESPECIFICOS O SIMPLEMENTE SACAR DE NUESTRA DIETA LOS ALIMENTOS QUE MAS ALERGIAS GENERAN A LA MAYORIA DE LA POBLACION

FLORA BACTERIANA
SUPONGAMOS QUE VISTE UN DOCUMENTAL SOBRE VEGANISMO Y DECIDES SER VEGANO DE AHORA EN MAS, PERO LLEVAS TODA UNA VIDA DE CARNE ASADA. TU FLORA BACTERIANA SE HA DESARROLLADO HASTA ENTONCES, ACORDE A TU DIETA HABITUAL.
LUEGO DE UNAS SEMANAS DE VEGANISMO TE SIENTES EXTREMADAMENTE DISTENDIDO. ESTO SE DEBE A LA DIETA O AL HECHO DE QUE TUS BACTERIAS NO PODIAN METABOLIZAR LA FIBRA INSOLUBLE QUE INGIERES CON LAS VERDURAS CRUDAS?

ENZIMAS DIGESTIVAS
A VECES MODIFICAMOS NUESTRA ALIMENTACION POR X RAZON, COMO PUEDE SUCEDER SI EMPIEZO UNA DIETA CETOGENICA PARA BAJAR DE PESO,. AL MES DE REALIZAR LA DIETA ME SIENTO PESIMO Y LUEGO VOY A CONTARLE A TODO EL MUNDO QUE ES UNA MALA DIETA Y QUE ME HIZO DAÑO, SIN SABER QUE MI PROBLEMA SE DEBIA A UN DEFICIT ENZIMATICO DE LA ENZIMA ENCARGADA DE DIGERIR GRASAS LLAMADA LIPASA.

DEFICIT NUTRICIONALES Y DISBALANCES
UN DEFICIT NUTRICIONAL O DISBALANCES COMO EL COLESTEROL DEBERIAN, IDEALMENTE, LLEVARTE A MODIFICAR TU DIETA. UNA DIETA ALTA EN GRASAS SALUDABLES Y BAJA EN PRODUCTOS ANIMALES PUEDE SER IDEAL FRENTE A UN EXCESO DE COLESTEROL LDL, PERO ES UNA MALA IDEA SI TIENES DEFICIT DE B12 Y DEFICIT PROTEICOS.

SEDENTARISMO 
ESTAR SENTADO 12 HORAS FRENTE A UN MONITOR OBVIAMENTE NO AYUDA A NUESTRO SISTEMA DIGESTIVO.
EVOLUCIONAMOS PARA ESTAR EN MOVIMIENTO, EL CUERPO NECESITA LA ACTIVIDAD DE LOS MUSCULOS VOLUNTARIOS (ABDOMINALES, GLUTEOS, ETC) PARA AYUDAR A LA MOVILIDAD DE INTESTINO DELGADO Y GRUESO.
LA POSICION QUE ASUMIMOS SENTADOS, COMPRIME INTESTINO DELGADO Y CIEGO, DIFICULTANDO EL PASAJE DEL BOLO ALIMENTICIO Y AYUDANDO A LA FERMENTACION Y SOBRECRECIMIENTO BACTERIANO.

ESTADO DE ANIMO
NUESTRO ESTADO DE ANIMO MODIFICA COMPLETAMENTE EL FUNCIONAMIENTO DEL SISTEMA DIGESTIVO. COMO?
LA ACTIVIDAD SIMPATICA (UN CONJUNTO DE PROCESOS QUE BUSCA AYUDARTE A SOBREVIVIR) APARECE COMO REACCION FRENTE AL ESTRES IMPIDIENDO EL PERISTALTISMO INTESTINAL (MOVIMIENTO) Y DESVIANDO EL FLUJO SANGUINEO DE INTESTINOS A MUSCULOS Y CEREBRO.

TODOS ESTOS PROBLEMAS SON FACILES DE SOLUCIONAR, PUEDO TOMAR PROBIOTICOS ACORDE A LA ALIMENTACION QUE QUIERO REALIZAR, MEJORAR MI SISTEMA INMUNE Y ELIMINAR LOS ALIMENTOS QUE ME GENERAN MAYOR NIVEL DE ALERGIA ALIMENTARIA, PUEDO CONSUMIR ENZIMAS DIGESTIVAS SI ES NECESARIO, MOVERME CADA UNA O DOS HORAS PARA AYUDAR AL SISTEMA DIGESTIVO, ARMAR MI DIETA ACORDE A MIS DEFICIT O DISBALANCES NUTRICIONALES E INCLUSO APRENDER A REDUCIR EL CORTISOL PARA BAJAR LA ACTIVIDAD SIMPATICA.

Debido a nuestro estilo de vida y la contaminación del medio ambiente cada vez existe una mayor concentración de tóxicos en nuestro cuerpo, entre ellos los denominados “metales pesados”, como el mercurio o el plomo. La quelación, o eliminación, de estos metales pesados es una herramienta eficaz para prevenir el daño oxidativo que estas sustancias pueden producirnos, que a su vez es la principal causa de la arterioesclerosis (daño de las arterias), que conduce a ictus e infartos cardíacos.

En esta conferencia gratuita, el Dr. Mejía nos expondrá la relación entre tóxicos y problemas de salud, las vías a través de las cuales llegan a nuestro cuerpo, los efectos nocivos que nos provocan y como su quelación, apoyada en la suplementación ortomolecular, nos puede ayudar a tratar y prevenir muchas enfermedades.

But who are they? How do they live? And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.

One percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country’s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. ""Manager Magazin” says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary ""Top of the World"" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.

Provoca un desarrollo económico, científico, técnico, religioso, social y cultural único en la historia.

A partir del siglo XIV, la cultura del Renacimiento revolucionó Europa y produjo artistas-eruditos como Leonardo da Vinci o Miguel Ángel, que representan un nuevo tipo de ser humano que ya no sólo quiere creer, sino que llega al fondo de las cosas y se considera a sí mismo un ser divino. Este documental de dos partes emprende la búsqueda de los orígenes de esta época: eruditos de Bizancio y del mundo árabe transmiten a Occidente el conocimiento perdido de la Antigüedad Clásica, provocando la innovación en todas las áreas del saber. Sin embargo, el Renacimiento no se limita a citar el legado grecorromano, sino que lo utiliza de palanca para avanzar. Ambos documentales analizan la reacción en cadena del progreso y su impacto en el presente. Se atreven a construir puentes con la (re)invención de la perspectiva central de los sistemas CAD, desde el hombre máquina de Leonardo hasta los jugadores robóticos autónomos. Ya en el Renacimiento existen actores globales, grandes bancos o medios de difusión masiva de informaciones y tesis. Este documental de dos partes cuenta la historia de manera tangible, amplia los instrumentos visuales del documental al recrear viajes en el tiempo a los puntos de inflexión de la historia. Puede decirse que nuestro mundo moderno sería inimaginable sin lo que ideó e inventó el Renacimiento.

En este vídeo Ousman Umar relata su viaje desde Ghana a Barcelona. Tardó cinco años en superar un periplo que define como ""infierno"". Con solo 13 años cruzó el desierto del Sahara caminando, vivió cuatro años en Libia bajo la dictadura de Muamar el Gadafi y llegó a Fuerteventura en patera en el año 2005. Estuvo meses durmiendo en la calle hasta que una familia lo acogió en Barcelona. Hoy, Umar apuesta por la formación en nuevas tecnologías como la mejor salida de la pobreza. Asegura que la solución es “ trabajar en el origen del problema para evitar que futuras víctimas caigan en este infierno”. 

Ousman Umar es emprendedor social y presidente de la ONG 'NASCO Feeding Minds', una iniciativa con la que ha puesto en marcha proyectos de alfabetización digital en su Ghana natal. Cuenta su historia en el libro 'Viaje al País de los Blancos'.

This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim’s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator’s men.

What is a Pulse Oximeter?

A Pulse Oximeter is a device that is used to quickly and easily monitor a person’s oxygen saturation. This means that is can measure the level of oxygen within the blood, specifically in arterial blood without using any invasive means.

Read Our Full Pulse Oximeter Reviews <U+0001F449>http://bit.ly/2qwUJH6

How Does a Pulse Oximeter Work?

Pulse oximeters work on a simple but brilliant principle. Blood absorbs light, and there’s a distinct difference between the wavelengths that go through oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood.

The finger clip of a pulse oximeter consists of a transmitting light source that emits a broad spectrum of light. On the other end, there’s a receiver that measures how much light passes through.

The diode on the receiving end is capable of detecting the wavelength of light. The internal circuits and processing components of the pulse oximeter do some calculations as well.

The device has to compensate for the ambient light, finger size, and the absorbance of the rest of the tissues.

There’s a reference curve saved in the memory of the device to calibrate the incoming readings and normalize them. This increases the precision of the results that it provides.

What Does a Pulse Oximeter Measure?

Pulse Oximeters measure the percentage of arterial oxygen primarily. In more precise terms, this is the amount of oxygen carried on blood hemoglobin. It’s known as SpO2.

Heart rate (HR) is automatically calculated alongside the percentage of oxygen.

HR and SpO2 complement one another, and clinicians find this double parameter readout quite informative.

How to Use a Pulse Oximeter?

Using a pulse oximeter is quite simple. You clip it on the middle right finger, a toe, or an earlobe. Some models are surface probes that you can attach to the forehead or chest.

Which Finger Is Best for a Pulse Oximeter?

The verdict came out that the middle finger of the right hand gives the best accuracy. The thumb of the same hand follows.

What are the Risks of Pulse Oximetry?

Thankfully, there aren’t any risks or dangers of using a pulse oximeter. The biggest concern is making sure that the device is giving an accurate reading.

What are the Normal Ranges for a Pulse Oximeter?

Heart rate –  60-100 beats/min
Oxygen Saturation –  95-100%

El problema de hacer 16/8 es que no llegas a activar la autofagia, el proceso de rejuvenecimiento celular mas importante que tiene el ayuno. Pero la ventaja es que es facil se realizar. Por lo cual te lo recomiendo para iniciarte en el ayuno intermitente si nunca hiciste.

Hacer 23/1 u OMAD es la mejor manera de maximizar los beneficios del ayuno intermitente pero para hacerlo bien evita estos errores mas frecuentes: 
No comas menos de lo que tendrias que comer diariamiente si no hicieras ayuno
Elige cenar si te resulta mas conveniente en cuanto a horarios, pero es mejor cambiar el horario si tienes reflujo gastrico y hacer un almuerzo solamente

20/4 es ideal como punto medio, porque resulta mas facil de realizar que 23/1, tienes 4 horas de autofagia diaria y a su vez es ideal para quien no puede comer lo suficiente en una sola comida. El aspecto negativo mas importante con respecto a hacer una sola comida por dia (23/1) es que obviamente los beneficios ligados a longevidad son menores.

Tune in for this unprecedented television event tracing freedom's first steps in the Nation's Capital.  ""Enslavement to Emancipation"" is an informative and compelling television documentary chronicling the history of the Compensated Emancipation Act of April 16, 1862, freeing the enslaved people of Washington, DC.  Featured historians and experts describe the creation and history of the city's annual Emancipation Day celebration and our continuing struggle for full democracy in DC.  The documentary also highlights the single largest attempted slave escape in U.S. history -- the daring and dramatic bid for freedom aboard a schooner called the Pearl.  ""Enslavement to Emancipation"" recounts the heroic war-time contributions of what was then called the U.S. First Colored Troops, African American slaves-turned-soldiers fighting for the Union during the Civil War.  These are just a few of the historic events detailed in this special television production presented only on TV-16.","2012-03-14T20:56:20.000Z","UCccwTHWlhdFgWclLnHIUNTg","OCTDC","911879","8024","588","0","2043","Education"

Hoy en día ya nadie duda del papel crucial que desempeñan las emociones en nuestra vida. Por eso, saber entenderlas y manejarlas es clave para mantener nuestro bienestar emocional y físico. Ahora bien, ¿Dónde nacen esas emociones? ¿Somos realmente responsables de lo que sentimos?

Muchas de nuestras emociones son parte de una «herencia familiar» y actuamos en función de lo que nos transmitieron desde pequeños. Dicho de otra manera, sentimos lo que sentimos porque así lo hemos aprendido.

En esta conferencia se presentará y desarrollará el contenido del nuevo libro de Enric Corbera, «Emociones para la vida», y se nos enseñará, a través de casos reales, diferentes herramientas prácticas para ser capaces de descubrir de donde proceden nuestros bloqueos y nuestras limitaciones.

Para poder recuperar la libertad y el bienestar emocional debemos indagar en nuestro interior, sin juicios ni apegos, con una mente abierta y compasiva, para finalmente convertirnos en dueños de nuestras creencias y, por lo tanto, de nuestra vida.

El arte de Ser Feliz es el título de una serie de artículos que escribió el filósofo alemán Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860), recopilados y posteriormente publicados.
""El arte de ser feliz"" nunca fue terminada y quedó en su forma más básica: ""50 Reglas para la Vida"" de las que se compone se redactaron en diversos momentos y se encuentran dispersas en los distintos volúmenes y carpetas del filósofo alemán.
En la filosofía pesimista de Schopenhauer concibe la idea de felicidad como una meta inalcanzable para los seres humanos e incluso el mismo concepto de felicidad, aplicado a la vida humana, no es más que un eufemismo dentro de la perspectiva de su metafísica pesimista. 
A partir de la convicción pesimista de que la vida de los seres humanos oscila entre el dolor y el aburrimiento y que, en consecuencia, este mundo no es otra cosa que un valle de lágrimas, Schopenhauer se vale del ingenio humano y la prudencia practica para encontrar reglas de conducta y de vida que nos ayuden a evitar las penurias y golpes del destino, con la esperanza de que, si bien la felicidad absoluta es inalcanzable, podamos llegar a esa felicidad relativa que consiste en la ausencia de dolor.

Cameraman Marco shows us how his family in Bolzano has come to terms with these exceptional times of closed schools and restricted movement. And we learn that many Italians appear to have adjusted to this most abnormal of new normalities.

La enfermedad alcohólica no depende de la cantidad de licor que yo tomo, no depende de la frecuencia con que yo lo hago, esta enfermedad depende de que yo, cuando tomo licor, pierdo el control sobre el licor. Esa persona que pierde el control frente al consumo del alcohol, padece la enfermedad alcohólica.
Esta enfermedad se caracteriza por una dependencia física y una dependencia psíquica. 
La dependencia física se caracteriza por dos aspectos, el primero porque cada vez se tiene que tomar más para experimentar el efecto del alcohol, eso se llama la tolerancia, se tiene que tomar más para embriagarse, este tema es fundamental en las citas porque cuando el paciente llega a la cita con el especialista, que por lo general es llevado por un familiar, la esposa o los hijos, el paciente dice que no es alcohólico porque según él se emborrachaba con media botella de licor, ahora se toma una garrafa y no tiene efectos, esto quiere decir que tiene una alta tolerancia al alcohol, el cerebro se ha adaptado a esta sustancia, lo que se debe revisar es lo que le pasa cuando deja de tomar, y lo que le pasa es que sufre guayabo nervioso, con varios síntomas que afectan gravemente la salud.

The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life – and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. 

The country’s most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.

Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.

During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.

In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin’s major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea.

El coronavirus se propaga por doquier. Los gobiernos toman medidas que restringen severamente nuestra vida diaria. Y Berlín, la capital alemana, no es una excepción.


Un equipo de la televisión pública alemana acompañó los últimos días a varios berlineses. La capital alemana es uno de los centros urbanos con mayor densidad de población del país y el lugar donde se decide qué hacer contra la pandemia. Restricciones que no afectan a todos los ciudadanos y ciudadanas por igual. Muchas personas temen, sencillamente, por su porvenir económico. Otros asumen un rol protagónico en estos tiempos. La joven médica Anna, por ejemplo, trabaja al límite en una consulta. Un estrés que la convivencia familiar apenas compensa. El gerente de supermercado Michael se concentra en transmitir calma a su clientela. Recuerda que no hay riesgo de desabastecimiento. El reportaje también presenta el miedo al futuro de un florista, una paciente de riesgo que no pisa la calle y un adolescente que solo quiere ayudar a los demás. Gente de Berlín en tiempos de covid-19.

Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?

""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.

Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.

Reputados investigadores explican el sutil efecto de esta hormona en los humanos.

A los hombres con alto nivel de testosterona se les atribuía la inclinación a luchar por el primer lugar. Ahora, la imagen de esta hormona sexual está cambiando. A diferencia de lo que ocurre en el reino animal, la afirmación general de que ""la testosterona vuelve agresivo"" no puede confirmarse en los seres humanos. Estudios científicos recientes sugieren que este neurotransmisor, en realidad estimula el comportamiento social y, a menudo, altruista. Uno de los principales expertos en este campo es el francés Jean-Claude Dreher, de Lyon. En sus experimentos de laboratorio nos muestra que la testosterona no produce agresividad, sino que permite que los hombres actúen de forma estratégica. Quien tiene más testosterona trata a los demás con más amabilidad para fortalecer su propio estatus. El psicólogo conductual británico Simon Baron Cohen demuestra que la testosterona determina ya en el útero, nuestro grado de masculinidad o feminidad. Y su colega Oliver Schultheiss, de Erlangen, descubrió que podemos aprender mejor bajo la influencia de la testosterona.

CDC Director On Models For The Months To Come: 'This Virus Is Going To Be With Us'

I have been saying this for a long time.

1 in 4 people can be asymptomatic

One of the [pieces of] information that we have pretty much confirmed now is that a significant number of individuals that are infected actually remain asymptomatic. That may be as many as 25%. That's important, because now you have individuals that may not have any symptoms that can contribute to transmission, and we have learned that in fact they do contribute to transmission.
And finally, of those of us that get symptomatic, it appears that we're shedding significant virus in our oropharyngeal compartment, probably up to 48 hours before we show symptoms. This helps explain how rapidly this virus continues to spread across the country, because we have asymptomatic transmitters and we have individuals who are transmitting 48 hours before they become symptomatic.

Shot with a hidden camera, it shows the brutal conditions in Chinese fur farms, and how migrants are exploited in Italian tanneries.

Fine handmade bags from Gucci, Prada and Max Mara in the displays of luxurious fashion boutiques are objects of passionate desire. Luxury labels generate over 70 percent of their turnover with leather products. But hardly anyone knows the reality of their production. The major fashion brands comply with a modern code of conduct that also applies to its direct suppliers. But who controls the subcontractors? The film looks behind the beautiful displays at where the raw material comes from: tanneries in Italy, where migrants produce the leather for luxury handbags under miserable and unsafe working conditions; and behind the scenes in China’s fur animal industry, where the animals are kept under catastrophic hygienic conditions and before being cruelly slaughtered.

Y es que, como dice Alba, “¿verdad que nadie se siente mejor consigo mismo después de levantar la voz? Normalmente nos sentimos más tensionados y enfadados. Así que si logramos gritar menos nos sentiremos mejor y podremos disfrutar más de nuestra familia”. Míriam subraya que, cuando grito, “le estoy enseñando a mi hijo que para las cosas importantes tiene que gritar y que no podemos comunicarnos de otra forma que no sea desde la falta de respeto. No solo somos su ejemplo, somos su faro y su guía”. Comunicarnos en su mismo plano, fomentar que tomen decisiones y sean responsables, dar pocas órdenes, claras, cara a cara y con voz bajita, tratar de relajarnos cuando nos vemos tensos y recordar que somos los adultos y no podemos culpar a nuestros hijos de que gritemos son algunas claves.

Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes.

C.), quien alcanzó el trono sin ser el heredero de Ciro el Grande, fue pionero en impulsar la división del Imperio persa aqueménida en provincias o satrapías –administradas mediante un sistema tributario–, en acuñar moneda entre los persas y en fijar por escrito la lengua de los antiguos persas en escritura cuneiforme, así como en conectar mediante una red de calzadas reales los diferentes territorios, los cuales se extendían desde el Mar Negro y las estepas rusas hasta la India y Egipto. El profesor de Historia Antigua Manel García Sánchez analiza la figura y la imagen del Gran Rey Darío a partir de los textos clásicos griegos y de las fuentes originales, como monedas y copas, inscripciones como las del relieve de Behistún y los motivos artísticos y arquitectónicos de la nueva capital de Persépolis.

"909","27","nDFoF3izhGQ","PT13M39S","false","hd","The Worst Economic Collapse In History Is Starting Now: Be Prepared","The worst economic collapse in history is on its way. Be Prepared

This is a chart of the 2008 Financial Crisis. Over the course of 517 days, The stock market dropped by more than 56%, millions of people lost their jobs… their homes… and their life savings. It was the worst time for the global economy since the great depression.

And this is the 2020 Economic Collapse…so far… Over the course of just 21 days, the market has dropped by roughly 20%, the world has seemingly shut down, and we just might be on the worst economic trajectory in history.


So how did we get here…and what could we expect going forward. Well lets start off with the first part.

The first thing is that…as most of you know, there is a global illness going around that many people are worried about. And from my previous videos, you might know that my position on this is that if you get the disease, you will almost certainly be fine. 

But it is disproportionately bad for the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions such as myself. So its good to be cautious on a social level, but also there isn’t need for you to panic on an individual level.

Initially when the disease had its first outbreak in China, it caused the Chinese Government to shutdown its manufacturing sector in order to help prevent the spread of the virus. Now, that wouldn’t be a problem…if 1/3 of all products in the world weren’t made in China. You see, China is the global supply chain of the world, so when China experiences delays in production, the entire worlds economy experiences delays as well. 

Now I made a whole video on why this is…. which you can check out on my channel… but I won’t dive into that in detail here… 

So, because of this supply chain slowdown, we have seen many large companies experience a slowdown in their sales and revenue. And this makes sense, because if you don’t have your product to sell, then you can’t make any money.

And here’s an example. The car industry is very dependant on tools, die, and machinery in order to manufacture their cars. But each on of these industries is experiencing 1 to 3 month delays because of the shutdown of the manufacturing sector. This means that car companies will not be able to launch their new annual vehicles on time, therefore missing out on billions of dollars worth of sales. 

And also, because people are being asked to stay inside, be cautious, and work from home if possible, we have seen up to an 80% drop in automotive sales in some countries like china. 

And this effect keeps trickling down. If the Car companies are seeing a drop in sales and revenue, then so will its suppliers. And if the suppliers see a drop in revenue, so will the raw industries that work with suppliers. And this effect radiates to all other companies that are connected to the automotive industry. 

And what happens when a company sees a drop in sales or revenue? Well, we tend to see things like layoffs, or even bankruptcies. This would lead to a higher unemployment rate which would lead to less purchases being made by consumers, which would lead to less sales being made by businesses. And the cycle continues until the economy hits a low point like the great recession or the great depression.

And keep in mind, this is just the automotive industry. This drop in sales will apply to virtually every other industry in the world…except the toilet paper industry because that’s actually manufactured in a bunch of different countries around the world…yet sales have increased for some companies like KP tissue by almost 50%. So…there is no toilet paper shortage everyone…just a bunch of hoarders buying 100 rolls at a time.

This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.

Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts.

"920","27","nRrJ1RPVRdE","PT15M45S","false","hd","Dolor lumbar bajo o de cintura - Tratamiento con ejercicios, automasajes y estiramientos","Ejercicios y automasajes para el dolor de espalda baja o dolor de cintura.
El dolor lumbar bajo también conocido como low back pain en Ingles, es uno de los problemas más frecuentes que afectan a la espalda en este caso a la zona lumbar. Comúnmente se le conoce como dolor de riñones o dolor de cintura aunque lo que realmente molesta este caso es la relación entre la quinta lumbar y el sacro.

Estiramiento. No sentarse se desplomó en su silla de escritorio todo el día. Levantarse cada 20 minutos más o menos y se extienden hacia otro lado. ""Debido a que la mayoría de nosotros pasamos mucho tiempo inclinarse hacia adelante en nuestros puestos de trabajo, es importante ponerse de pie y estirar hacia atrás a lo largo del día"", dice Reicherter. No se olvide de estirar las piernas también. Algunas personas encuentran alivio de su dolor de espalda haciendo un habitual de estiramiento de rutina, como el yoga .

Piense ergonómico. El diseño de su espacio de trabajo para que no tenga que encorvarse hacia delante para ver el monitor del ordenador o de llegar a la salida de su ratón. Utilizar una silla de escritorio que apoya su espalda baja y le permite mantener los pies firmemente plantados en el suelo.

Cuide su postura. Slumping hace que sea más difícil para su espalda para soportar su peso . Sea especialmente cuidadoso de su postura al levantar objetos pesados. Nunca se incline desde la cintura. En su lugar, doblar y enderezar de las rodillas .

Use zapatos de tacón bajo. Cambia tus bombas de cuatro pulgadas de pisos o de tacón bajo (menos de 1 pulgada). Los tacones altos pueden crear una postura más inestable, y aumentar la presión sobre la región lumbar.

Dejar el hábito.


Fumar puede aumentar su riesgo de osteoporosis de la columna vertebral y otros problemas óseos. La osteoporosis puede a su vez conducir a la compresión de fracturas de la columna vertebral . La investigación reciente encontró que los fumadores son más propensos a tener dolor de espalda baja en comparación con los no fumadores.

Controle su peso. Utilice la dieta y el ejercicio para mantener su peso dentro de un rango saludable para su altura. Al ser el sobrepeso pone exceso de estrés en la columna vertebral.

Pruebe un analgésico de venta libre. Los fármacos anti-inflamatorios como la aspirina, el ibuprofeno (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin), y naproxeno sódico (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn) pueden ayudar a reducir el dolor de espalda. El acetaminofeno (Actamin, Panadol, Tylenol) es otra opción más de venta libre para el tratamiento del dolor. Asegúrese de consultar con su médico o farmacéutico acerca de cualquier interacción over-the-analgésicos de venta libre pueden tener con otros medicamentos que esté tomando. Las personas con una historia de ciertas condiciones médicas (tales como úlceras, enfermedad renal y hepática enfermedad) deben evitar algunos medicamentos.

Llame a su médico si:

El dolor de espalda baja es grave, no desaparece al cabo de unos días, o le duele incluso cuando está en reposo o acostado.
Tiene debilidad o entumecimiento en las piernas, o tiene dificultad para estar de pie o caminar.
Se pierde el control sobre los intestinos o la vejiga .
Estos síntomas podrían indicar que usted tiene un problema neurológico u otra condición médica subyacente que necesita ser tratada
Tal vez doblado el camino equivocado al levantar algo pesado. O que está tratando con una enfermedad degenerativa, como la artritis . Cualquiera que sea la causa, una vez que tenga baja el dolor de espalda , puede ser difícil de quitar. Aproximadamente uno de cada cuatro estadounidenses dicen que han tenido un episodio reciente de baja dolor de espalda . Y casi todo el mundo puede llegar a tener dolor de espalda en algún momento de sus vidas
A veces, es claramente seria: Si resultó lesionado, o siente adormecimiento, debilidad u hormigueo en las piernas. Llamar al médico, por supuesto. Pero para el dolor lumbar rutina y suave, aquí hay algunos consejos simples para probar en casa.
Enfriarlo. El hielo es mejor en las primeras 24 a 48 horas después de una lesión, ya que reduce la inflamación, dice Anne E. Reicherter, PhD, PT, DPT, profesor asociado de la terapia física en la Universidad de Maryland School of Medicine. ""A pesar de que el calor se siente bien porque ayuda a cubrir el dolor y sí ayuda a relajar los músculos, el calor realmente inflama los procesos inflamatorios,"" dice ella. Después de 48 horas, se puede cambiar a calor, si lo prefiere. Ya sea que utilice calor o hielo - quitárselo después de unos 20 minutos para dar a su piel un descanso. Si el dolor persiste, consulte con un médico.","2016-05-29T15:16:16.000Z","UC6iRiXWScChTr6uNLXjJYFQ","FisioOnline","5018222","65155","4403","0","1369","Education"

Sabemos que la hernia de disco es un desplazamiento del disco intervertebral que genera una protrusión del contenido del disco. La protrusión puede pinzar las raíces nerviosas, lo que genera una serie de síntomas como dolor en el territorio que inerva la raíz nerviosa, debilidad y contracturas a nivel muscular, alteraciones sensitivas, etc. La hernia de disco se diagnostica a través de los síntomas y de pruebas imagenológicas especiales como las resonancias magnéticas.

La causa de la hernia de disco desde el punto de vista clásico o convencional son los esfuerzos violentos o repetitivos o procesos degenerativos tanto del disco vertebral como de la vértebra. Sin embargo, ninguna de estas es la causa real, son simplemente detonadores.

El fisioterapeuta Fernando Queipo explica que la verdadera causa es el desajuste de las cadenas miofasciales que van generando la compresión del disco. Alguna cadena mofascial se acorta o se retrae, mientras que las otras cadenas lo compensan. Es en ese juego de tensiones y compensaciones cuando el disco se comprime, sale su contenido, irrita a la raíz nerviosa y genera los síntomas. Aprende a tratar la causa de la hernia con este vídeo.

Para esta receta podemos usar cualquier cerveza con alcohol, ya que para su elaboración, usaremos bicarbonato que le ayudara a crecer.
Evidentemente la cerveza comercial está pasteurizada, pero es un buen aliado para hacer pan, ojo que no enseño a hacer “levadura” enseño pan con bicarbonato y cerveza.
Este pan es apto para niños y adultos ya que el alcohol se evapora totalmente y no deja sabor alguno a nuestro pan, vas a comprobar que es una masa fantastica, con la que elaboramos un pan francés maravilloso sin usar levadura.
Es importante que veas el final del video, ya que en el te explico varias cosas importantes de esta receta y seria ideal que lo veas antes de que formules preguntas.

Ingredientes prefermento:

125 gr harina todo uso (1 taza)
125 ml cerveza (1/2 taza)
5 gr  azúcar (1 cdta)

Ingredientes masa final:
El Prefermento 
250 gr harina todo uso (2 tazas)
90 ml agua tibia (1/3 taza)
8 gr sal ( 1 + 1/2 cdta)
5 gr bicarbonato (1 cdta)

Pasos:
Preparamos el prefermento y dejamos toda la noche tapado dentro del horno a pagado (8 horas) 
Preparamos los ingredientes de la masa de pan y el prefermento que ya ha reposado toda la noche.
Unimos todos los ingredientes menos la sal y mezclamos y despues ya añadimos la sal y pasamos a amasar el pan.
La masa es algo pegajosa, por lo que te tienes que ayudar de una espatula o rasqueta de pan para raspar la mesa.
Daremos un reposo de 3 horas y antes de ponernos a formar el pan precalentar el horno con calor general, ventilador o calor arrina y abajo y cuando el horno ya este caliente formamos el pan, le damos el corte y metemos rapidamente al horno para que no se deforme.
Horneamos y dejamos enfriar antes de consumir.

El ajedrez no sólo no es aburrido, sino que se trata de una de las herramientas educativas más divertidas y eficaces. Con el ajedrez es posible transmitir, desde la infancia, valores y habilidades que serán útiles para toda la vida. Así lo afirma el periodista especializado en ajedrez Leontxo García. En este vídeo, Leontxo nos ofrece un viaje fascinante a través de la Historia del ajedrez. También explica cómo y porqué éste deporte se convirtió en la llave del desarrollo de la denominada ‘Inteligencia Artificial’. Del mismo modo, enumera algunos de sus beneficios para la prevención de algunas enfermedades degenerativas. Las anécdotas se suceden cuando éste histórico corresponsal explica cómo fueron sus coberturas informativas de algunos de los duelos más míticos de la Historia de éste juego. Sin embargo, a día de hoy asegura: “Para mí, lo más emocionante del ajedrez sigue siendo su enorme valor como herramienta educativa”.

Leontxo García es periodista especializado en ajedrez desde hace más de 30 años y ajedrecista desde los 14. En 1983 descubrió su vocación periodística y desde entonces ha dedicado todo su esfuerzo a la divulgación del ajedrez. Ha sido corresponsal, presentador de televisión, redactor y conferenciante en más de una veintena de países. Es también autor del libro ‘Ajedrez y Ciencia, pasiones mezcladas’, y en 2011 fue galardonado con la Medalla al Mérito Deportivo. En los últimos años ha centrado sus esfuerzos en llevar el ajedrez al ámbito educativo.","2018-09-03T16:20:34.000Z","UCI6QcXatdaEAaRTRjl3dc0w","AprendemosJuntos","206068","5742","120","0","179","Education"

Investigaciones en todo el mundo están demostrando que se esconde mucha verdad en estos antiguos saberes. Si es así... ¿somos entonces lo que comemos?
En Reino Unido, un estudio en una prisión reveló que los presos que tomaron suplementos vitamínicos eran menos propensos a la violencia. Y en Alemania, una psicóloga de la Universidad de Lübeck ha demostrado que la composición del desayuno influye en el comportamiento social. Pero, ¿qué sucede realmente en el cerebro cuando elegimos comer miel en lugar de mermelada, y pescado en vez de salchicha? Científicos de todo el mundo están tratando de descubrir precisamente eso. La neuronutrición es la rama de la ciencia entre la neurología y la nutrición. Los experimentos con ratas o moscas ofrecen nuevos datos sobre nuestro comportamiento alimenticio. El consumo de comida chatarra en ratas de laboratorio no solo les provoca obesidad, sino que también tiene un impacto directo en su memoria. El papel de la flora intestinal se conoce desde hace tiempo, pero los científicos están descubriendo otras conexiones. La alimentación neurosaludable, por ejemplo: la denominada dieta mediterránea, que se basa principalmente en verduras y pescado, podría proporcionar la mejor alimentación para las pequeñas células grises. Los ácidos grasos omega-3, que se encuentran en el pescado, por ejemplo, protegen a las células nerviosas y son esenciales para el desarrollo del cerebro. Ahora, más que nunca sabemos que nuestro cerebro es lo que comemos.

Food banks are facing unprecedented demand, and homeless shelters now have long waiting lists, as families who have known a much better life have to leave their homes, sometimes with just a few days notice.  America’s Poor Kids meets three children whose families are struggling to get by, and asks them to tell us what life in modern America really looks like through their eyes.

Told from the point of view of the children themselves, this one-hour documentary offers a unique perspective on the nation's flagging economy and the impact of unemployment, homelessness and poverty as seen through the eyes of the children affected.

“Siempre me pasa lo mismo”, “es típico que me pase”, “yo soy así y es normal”. Son frases que todos hemos dicho cuando repetimos situaciones que nos hacen quedar atrapados en una sensación de bucle constante.

Con frecuencia, normalizamos estas situaciones pensando que ocurren por casualidad o “mala suerte”, sintiéndonos víctimas de las circunstancias. Sin embargo, la casualidad no existe. Heredamos conductas y experiencias traumáticas de nuestros familiares y repetimos las situaciones que ellos no pudieron superar. Es justamente esta historia oculta la que nos hace caer en dramas y experiencias dolorosas una y otra vez. 

En esta conferencia, Enric Corbera, a través del método de la Bioneuroemoción®, explicará cómo identificar estas repeticiones y la importancia de comprender por qué las repetimos, con el objetivo de que, cuando vuelvan a ocurrir, podamos elegir cómo vivirlas. En definitiva, comprender para poder elegir.

Si te equivocas una vez puede ser un error, si te equivocas dos veces es una elección.

En 'Padre Rico Padre Pobre' Robert Kiyosaki nos detalla qué es lo que los padres ricos les enseñan a sus hijos, que aquellos padres que pertenecen a la clase media no.
En este libro sobre finanzas personales, Kiyosaki repasa las 6 lecciones que aprendió del padre de su mejor amigo, y que he querido resumir en este vídeo.
Contrariamente a lo que uno podría pensar en un principio, el padre  rico de Kiyosaki no es aquel con un título universitario, sino aquel que tuvo que dejarse el instituto o la escuela, para emprender desde una edad temprana.
Sin embargo, el verdadero padre de Robert, al que se refiere en el libro como su 'padre pobre'; a pesar de poseer estudios superiores, cuando se trataba de dinero, ponía su cerebro a dormir.
'No estoy interesado en el dinero' 
'Trabajo porque amo mi empleo'
Eran algunas de las excusas con las que el padre de Kiyosaki evadía un tema importante como son las finanzas de cada uno.
'Cada año, mi padre esperaba ansiosamente el día en el que finalmente le aumentaran el sueldo, y cada año acababa decepcionado.'
La propuesta de Kiyosaki es simple:
'No trabajes por dinero, haz que el dinero trabaje para ti'.
'Muchas veces, la causa de problemas económicos es pasar toda tu vida trabajando para otra persona.'
'Pasan toda su vida trabajando, para, al final, no tener nada con lo cuál poder mostrar el resultado de su esfuerzo.'
Hacerse rico o millonario puede ser tan sencillo como desarrollar ese hábito o hábitos que empujan a uno hacia una mayor prosperidad económica.
Saber cuál es ese hábito que te hará rico y que podrías haber implementado ya en tu día a día, no es algo excesivamente complejo de hacer, pero, aún así, muchas personas se resisten a llevarlo a la práctica.
Si tú eres capaz de instaurar esos hábitos que la gente rica tiene metidos en su cabeza, tendrás incontables oportunidades de cambiar tu situación financiera, al contrario que todas aquellas otras personas que no tienen la motivación o fuerza de voluntad suficiente como para instaurar esos hábitos de personas ricas en su vida.
Ser rico no es el dinero que tienes en tu cuenta corriente. Ser millonario no es una cuestión de los números que recibes en un cheque a fin de mes.
Ser rico es una cuestión de la mentalidad y los hábitos que desarrollas respecto al dinero.
Si tienes la oportunidad de ver, y eres capaz de observar cuáles son los hábitos de los ricos, con respecto a cuáles son los hábitos de las personas menos prósperas, verás enormes diferencias.
No hay una fórmula mágica para ser feliz, para ganar dinero, o para ser millonario en 60 minutos. A medida que el mundo cambia, los negocios cambian, y las ideas o propuestas de negocio varían considerablemente.
Es por eso que tu mente debe estar en continuo cambio y adaptarse.
Hábitos como ser constante, pensar como un inversor, definir tus prioridades, trabajar para aprender, aprender sobre leyes e impuestos, etc. son algunos de los hábitos de las personas millonarias, que posiblemente también serían beneficiosas para tí.
Quedas avisado :) :
Si quieres aprender a hacer a tu dinero trabajar por ti, decidir cuál quieres que sea tu trabajo, y elegir la edad a la que quieres retirarte, entonces 'Padre Rico Padre Pobre' (y este vídeo) de Robert Kiyosaki es para ti.

Hernán Cortes llevó a cabo una implacable campaña militar en la que demostró su capacidad política y diplomática, construyendo el Reino de la Nueva España en los principios del mestizaje de las culturas mexica e hispana, el establecimiento de la religión católica y el predominio de la organización metropolitana.

“BBVA Aprendemos juntos”, un proyecto de BBVA y El País para una vida mejor

Víctor Küppers nos ofrece en este vídeo una serie de claves sobre el poder que tiene la  ‘actitud’ para desarrollar el máximo potencial de las personas: ""Tú vales tus conocimientos, tus habilidades y tu actitud, pero la actitud multiplica”, explica.
 
Victor Küppers es Doctor en Humanidades y Licenciado en Administración y Dirección de Empresas. Profesor universitario y formador, Küppers  es autor de libros de éxito como ""El efecto Actitud"" y ""Vivir una vida con sentido"".
 
Küppers nos anima a cuidar y mantener las relaciones humanas en un mundo tan absorbente como el actual. Entre las claves que aporta están el cariño, el tiempo y la actitud. ""Hay veces que las personas se desaniman. Cuando son nuestros hijos yo solo conozco dos palabras: cariño y tiempo. Porque esa es la base de las relaciones humanas"".

Apasionado por la psicología positiva, su pensamiento se podría resumir en esta frase: “Que nadie se acerque a ti sin que al irse se sienta un poco mejor y más feliz”. Para Küppers esta es la definición de una ‘persona espectacular’.

At 20 years young, Grandmaster Robert James Fischer was already among the world's very best chess players. In this brilliancy, Fischer demonstrates how to inject multiple imbalances into a highly symmetrical position, how to properly highlight these differences to benefit oneself, and how to accurately assess the true value of the pieces as they rest on the board.

Con esta sencilla frase sintetiza el V. M. Samael (http://samael.es), en su libro El matrimonio perfecto, la importancia de ésta figura geométrica que llamamos pentagrama. Su nombre viene del griego y significa cinco líneas. Otros nombres que recibe, como pentalfa (cinco alphas) o pentáculo (cinco ángulos), vuelven a hacer referencia al cinco. El pentagrama ya era conocido en la antigua Mesopotamia, pero sabemos que fue Pitágoras el que le dedicó la máxima atención, estudiándolo, reverenciándolo y adoptándolo como símbolo de su escuela iniciática. Parece ser que fue la Escuela pitagórica, con su estudio exhaustivo, la que descubrió sus bellas propiedades geométricas, científicas y mágicas, que entonces no estaban en absoluto diferenciadas. Los pitagóricos también conocieron y estudiaron el número Phi, número de oro o divina proporción, el cual tiene un papel muy importante en el pentagrama, estando presente en las relaciones entre sus partes.

Con unos pocos consejos podemos conseguir que los problemas lumbares y la hernia discal lumbar no empeore, y se puede conseguir evitar la operación quirúrgica o cirugía de la hernia discal lumbar.  

Pero otra forma de afrontar el dolor lumbar y la hernia discal lumbar es preguntarse por las posibles causas que lo provocan. Ante una hernia discal lumbar lo primero que debemos hacer es descartar que la causa sea traumática, Es decir un accidente, Por ejemplo en el ámbito deportivo, O un accidente de tráfico. Otro aspecto a valorar es los posibles gestos repetitivos y mal ejecutados, por ejemplo al levantar peso, O incluso estar sentados durante muchas horas del día durante muchos años.

Pero finalmente hay que tener cuenta que hay otros factores no tan fácilmente identificables a nivel del funcionamiento de nuestro organismo. Por ejemplo el mal funcionamiento de un órgano o víscera puede repercutir directamente sobre la tensión muscular de la espalda facilitando la hernia discal. Por ejemplo el intestino delgado facilita las hernias entre la cuarta y a quinta vértebra lumbar hacia el lado derecho, o por ejemplo el mal funcionamiento del riñón así como el colon irritable facilita la hernia discal entre la quinta vértebra lumbar y el sacro siempre hacia el lado izquierdo. 

Tenemos que tener en cuenta que no me refiero a anfermedades sino a disfunciones provocadas por mala alimentación y por estrés y factores emocionales.

Y se hizo profesor y escritor. Confiesa cómo fue volver a la poesía después del éxito de su novela ""Patria"" (2016). Habló también de su autobiografía en prosa, ""Autorretrato sin mí"" (2018), donde “me he dado entero” –afirma–, y de la que Antonio Lucas destacó la búsqueda de la complicidad del lector acerca de temas como la ausencia del padre fallecido, la experiencia amorosa o la paternidad. En palabras de Aramburu, el lector de poesía “tiene que ser un poco poeta, tiene que tener las cuerdas sensibles suficientes para que vibren”. En ""Vetas profundas"" (2019), su último libro, reúne sus reflexiones sobre poemas de cuarenta autores como San Juan de la Cruz, Lope de Vega, Rosalía de Castro o Alfonsina Storni. A su juicio, “la poesía, la experiencia de lo poético, es una necesidad básica del ser humano”.

El análisis de los diferentes elementos identitarios se aborda, principalmente, a partir de la evolución de la lengua, la urbanística y la sociedad de forma celtibérica y la interacción entre los diferentes pueblos, y en contraste con las visiones míticas precedentes. Para concluir, destaca la importancia de tener interés por la historia y atender a los nuevos hallazgos, afirmando: “el conocer nuestro pasado es nuestra memoria colectiva”.

A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of Lübeck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called ""brain food"" for example: The Mediterranean diet that’s based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!

A partir de varios viajes por el aislado país, ha logrado establecer relaciones con la población local. Ha descubierto allí las mismas necesidades humanas que tenemos nosotros, pero ocultas por un velo de represión y adoctrinamiento. Quien se aventure detrás de la última cortina de hierro del mundo experimentará un viaje muy especial: a Corea del Norte, de donde siempre observamos las mismas imágenes de lanzamientos de cohetes y coloridos eventos en masas. El país está gobernado por el dictador Kim Jong Un, a quien el pueblo venera, o tiene que venerar, como un dios supremo. Poco se sabe sobre la vida cotidiana en Corea del Norte, ya que las imágenes que salen al exterior son censuradas por el gobierno. Los viajeros no pueden ver la opresión, la uniformidad forzada de la sociedad y la población hambrienta del país. No obstante, el periodista Luca Faccio logra descubrir una interesante perspectiva de este país aislado, eso sí, siempre acompañado por un vigilante del servicio público.

Óscar Aguilera","En esta ponencia, el investigador Oscar Aguilera explica la actualidad sobre “Vitamina C y el Cáncer”, sus investigaciones al respecto y la fisiología tras la suplementación a nivel endovenoso de este compuesto.

Ponente:
Óscar Aguilera Martínez. 

Coordinador del Departamento de Oncología Traslacional del Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de la Fundación Jiménez Díaz. Publicó en 2016 en Oncotarget un importante estudio que demuestra que la vitamina C logra desacoplar la proteína KRAS mutada de la membrana celular inhibiendo así la activación de enzimas metabólicas internas que son clave para la transformación neoplásica.
Descubrimiento trascendente porque avala y explica en buena medida los numerosos estudios realizados sobre la eficacia anticancerígena selectiva de la vitamina C intravenosa ya que el gen KRAS mutado está presente en muy diversos tumores. Asimismo demuestra la importancia del metabolismo en el crecimiento, invasividad, angiogénesis y metástasis de los tumores apoyando la tesis del Dr. Otto Warburg de que la causa principal del cáncer es la privación de oxígeno a nivel celular.

""Hey, listen, you're in my house,"" Obama said. ""It's not respectful, when you get invited to somebody [...] You're not going to get a good response from me by interrupting me like this.""

Obama's answer to the heckler got a good response from the crowd, which started to boo and chant the president's name.

""Shame on you,"" Obama said to the heckler. ""You shouldn't be doing this.""

The president then offered the heckler a choice: Stay quiet or be removed. The person continued to speak, and officials escorted him out.

HOLY LAND: STARTUP NATIONS (SERIES 2)
Premiering in February, the second season of WIRED’s Future Cities series takes us inside one of the world’s biggest startup nations. With the most tech startups and venture capital per capita in the world, Israel has long been hailed as The Startup Nation. WIRED’s four-part series will look beyond Tel Aviv’s vibrant, liberal tech epicentre to the wider Holy Land region – the Palestinian territories, where a parallel Startup Nation story is emerging in East Jerusalem, Ramallah and the West Bank, as well as in the Israeli cybersecurity hub of Beersheba. And we will learn how the fertile innovation ecosystem of Silicon Wadi has evolved as a result of its unique political, geographical and cultural situation and explore the future challenges – and solutions – these nations are facing.

I will show how we can use a pulse oximeter device to measure SpO2 saturation in our blood. This device will tell us how healthy our lung is by measuring the oxygen level in the blood. If there is any respiratory infection like COVID-19, the SpO2 level will go down. Therefore, the Oxygen saturation level indirectly indicates the infection. We can tell the severity of the Corona Virus lung infection with the saturation level.

Healthy Person: 94-100% SpO2 saturation
You need Oxygen support at less than 93% SpO2 saturation (Call for help)

These figures are very important during the current COVID-19 pandemic as many known infected patients are quarantined at home due to lack of medical resources. Only severe cases are being hospitalized and hence the patients should know the severity of their illness by monitoring the SpO2 levels to call for help.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","2014-10-21T16:19:48.000Z","UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q","TEDx Talks","3178465","73889","4456","0","2893","Nonprofits & Activism"

Y esto no se sale en la prensa. Es grave lo que estáis viendo todos. Y no pasa nada. Sin organizaciones criminales organizadas en este Cortijo Andaluz. Son gente que parece honorable, pero actúan impunemente porque en la justicia también hay sinvergüenzas.

Sois una panda de cabronazos. Y los que miráis a otro lado también. A ver qué pasa después de este vídeo. Confío que alguien actuará. Si no, no os preocupéis. Se lo diré a mi amigo Spiriman y entonces no os quejéis de mis formas, de mis insultos y de mi agresividad, siempre dentro de lo que me permite la ley. <U+0001F609> <U+0001F60E>#yeah
