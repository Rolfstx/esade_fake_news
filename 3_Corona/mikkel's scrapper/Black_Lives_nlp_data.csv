"57",0,"Damaged Babies & Broken Hearts: Ukraine's commercial surrogacy industry | Foreign Correspondent","Ukraine is the new ‘go-to’ destination for couples desperate to be parents. But our investigation uncovers an industry out of control that exploits surrogate mothers and leaves babies abandoned.With international surrogacy now banned in Thailand and India, a thriving industry has sprung up in Ukraine, attracting heterosexual couples from around the world, including Australia.  But how much do would-be parents really know about the business which delivers their baby?  In Motherland, Europe correspondent Samantha Hawley goes behind the slick surrogacy websites and glossy brochures to expose the industry’s dark underbelly.  In a 6-month investigation, Foreign Correspondent meets those caught up in Ukraine’s baby business and uncovers an industry with few rules and fewer scruples.  The new parent  “It was a reckless decision to make, because we didn’t have all the facts,” says English woman ‘Kate’ who turned to surrogacy after an illness left her unable to have a child. When the birth of her baby boy in Ukraine went badly, Kate couldn’t get him the urgent medical help he needed. She realised she was out of her depth. Now she worries about the long-term health effects on her baby.  The surrogate mother  “They don’t treat you as a human being,” says one birth mother, who signed up as a surrogate to feed her family after the war with Russia left her homeless.To earn a small fee, she endured forced terminations, caesareans and callous treatment at the hands of her agency. “Surrogate mothers…we’re just a flow of incubators,” she says.The abandoned child  We tracked down a little girl living in a children’s home in south-east Ukraine. She had been rejected by her American parents and was stateless and an orphan.  This is a common story, says Ukraine’s Children’s Ombudsman, who has reports of at least 10 children left behind by the parents and agencies who ‘commissioned’ them.  “This is an immoral business,” says the Ombudsman. “It does harm.” The businessman  And we put hard questions to the owner of one of Ukraine’s biggest surrogacy agencies, a man who was recently under house arrest facing charges of child trafficking and tax avoidance.Join us for this gripping and gut-wrenching tale.

The lawyers discovered that three other Australian victims had been scammed by the same drug syndicate and then released — but that somehow this evidence hadn’t been shared in time to rescue Yoshe from serving six years in jail.Now back in Australia, Yoshe is sharing her story for the first time, in a warning to others about the perils of online romance.This is a two-part Australian Story.

It’s a remote corner of the world, but what is taking place in China’s Xinjiang province is nothing short of breathtaking. Today its Uyghur population is being systematically rounded up and detained, with estimates of as many as a million citizens being held in re-education camps.Even those still left in their homes are being monitored. The communist regime is using cutting edge technology, mass surveillance tools and artificial intelligence to control an entire population.By piecing together witness accounts from Australian citizens caught up in the Chinese Government’s campaign, along with satellite imagery analysis and official documents uncovered online, the truth about what is occurring in Xinjiang is laid bare.We have uncovered evidence of detainees being forced to work in factories with implications for Australian companies doing business in the region.We also reveal concerning evidence about Australia’s links to China’s dystopian surveillance state and the tools used to racially profile its own citizens.The events unfolding in China are creating heartbreak for Uyghurs in Australia.They have stayed quiet for fear of provoking the authorities into punishing their relatives. Now, in desperation they are breaking their silence to tell the world what is going on.---------------------Watch more Four Corners investigations here: https://bit.ly/2JbpMkf You can also like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/abc4corners/ Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/4corners And sign up to our newsletter: https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/newsl...---------------------This program features contributions from:Nurmuhammad Majid, East Turkistan Australian AssociationAdam TuranSadam AbudusalamuNurgul Sawut, Australian Uyghur AssociationProf James Leibold, ethnic policy in China, La Trobe UniversityDr Darren Byler, anthropologist, University of WashingtonAlmas NizamidinNathan Ruser, Satellite analyst, Australian Strategic Policy InstituteDr Adrian Zenz, Independent researcherHayrullah MaiGulnur IdreisCheng Jingye, China's Ambassador to Australia","ABC News","t-axd1Ht_J8"

Follow reporter Michael Koenigs @MikeOnABikeABC for more profile pieces.  Kent, a former neo-Nazi, credits an African-American parole officer named Tiffany Whittier with helping him to see beyond skin color and changing his views about white supremacy.“If it wasn’t for her I would have seeped back into it,” said Kent. “I look at her as family.”Whittier, 45, even inspired Kent, 38, to take down the Nazi flags he had hanging in his living room and replace them with smiley faces.“I’m not here to judge him. That’s not my job to judge. My job is to be that positive person in someone’s life,” Whittier said.Added Kent, “When you wake up and see a smiley face, you’re going to go to work and you’re going to smile.”PHOTO: Former skinhead Michael Kent gives his former parole officer Tiffany Whittier a hug after she surprises him at his home.ABC NewsFormer skinhead Michael Kent gives his former parole officer Tiffany Whittier a hug after she surprises him at his home.more +Kent now works full-time on a chicken farm in Colorado, where all his co-workers are Hispanic.“Before all this, I wouldn’t work for anybody or with anybody that wasn’t white,” said Kent. “[Now] we have company parties, or they have quinceañeras, I’m the only white guy there!”Redemption Ink, a national non-profit that offers free removals of hate-related tattoos, helped connect Kent with Fallen Heroes Tattoo in Colorado to begin the 15-hour process of covering his swastikas. The sterile environment is new to Kent who had his previous ink work done in prison.“I’ve never, never, never been inside of a tattoo shop getting a professional tattoo,” he said.Kent believes the painful process will help him move forward after spending years as a member of a violent skinhead group based in Arizona. As a father of two young children, Kent also hopes his children will see the world differently.“I don’t want my kids to live the life I lived and live with hate,” said Kent. “I want my kids to know me for who I am now—a good father, a hard worker, and a good provider.”SUBSCRIBE to ABC NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/ABCNews/Watch More on http://abcnews.go.com/LIKE ABC News on FACEBOOKhttps://www.facebook.com/abcnewsFOLLOW ABC News on TWITTER:https://twitter.com/abcGOOD MORNING AMERICA'S HOMEPAGE:https://gma.yahoo.com/","ABC News","njXZUH5hv0w"

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!""","CBS News","leW-seXnhBc"

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia.

"570",1,"Thomas Sowell on the Myths of Economic Inequality","Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master’s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell’s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell’s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

"572",1,"Sir Roger Scruton: How to Be a Conservative","Recorded on February 27, 2017In the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he’s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain. Sir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn’t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics. Robinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the “indigenous working classes” who made their voices known through their votes. About the Guest: Sir Roger ScrutonSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his “services to philosophy, teaching and public education.”Additional Resources: Brexit:http://www.hoover.org/news/hoover-fel...http://www.hoover.org/research/brusse...http://www.hoover.org/research/gibral...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...http://www.hoover.org/research/will-b...

"574",1,"Mathematical Challenges to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution","Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathe...Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin’s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin’s theory in their two books and essay, respectively The Deniable Darwin, Darwin’s Doubt, and “Giving Up Darwin” (published in the Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term “species” has not been defined by the authors to Darwin’s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin’s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): “Beauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe—walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track—most of the time.” Gelernter notes that there’s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture—not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin’s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

"575",1,"Jason Riley On “False Black Power?”","Recorded on February 21, 2019. What is “false black power?” According to Jason Riley, author of False Black Power?, it is political clout, whereas true black power is human capital and culture. Riley and Peter Robinson dive into the arguments in Riley’s new book, the history of African Americans in the United States, and welfare inequality in black communities.  Riley discusses the Moynihan report of 1965, which documented the rise of black families headed by single women in inner cities and how this report was something black sociologists had already been writing about for several years. He argues that there was clearly a breakdown of the nuclear family and that this is a result of the “Great Society” welfare programs of the 1960s rather than the legacy of slavery or Jim Crow laws. In the 1960s, Riley posits that the black activist community’s shift towards political engagement was misguided. He argues that the idea of black political clout leading to black economic advancement was misplaced. Other impoverished communities (i.e. Irish, Jewish, and Italian immigrant communities) at various times in American history focused on economic advancement first before trying to achieve political clout, and they were successful. Instead, the black community focused first on electing black politicians, which ended up doing very little for the economic advancement of the community as politicians typically put their own interests first, above their communities’. Riley points out that the economic data shows that black communities became more impoverished under black leadership. Riley proposes a solution of advocating for more school-choice vouchers, which allow black parents to take better control of their children’s futures and place them in the best schools for them. He also argues for reducing social safety nets, making them a more temporary form of welfare rather than the multigenerational welfare system currently in place.

"576",1,"Wealth, Poverty, and Politics","Recorded on September 18, 2015Hoover Institution fellow Thomas Sowell discusses poverty around the world and in the United States. Poverty in America, he says, compared to the rest of the world, is not severe.  Many poor people in poverty in the United States have one or two cars, central heating, and cell phones. The real problem for the poor is the destruction of the family, which Sowell argues dramatically increased once welfare policies were introduced in the 1960s.","Hoover Institution","sGYl17DiEwo"
"577",1,"Discrimination and Disparities with Thomas Sowell","Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of “disparate impact” and how it disregards the American legal principle of “burden of proof.” Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like “disparate impact” fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child’s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

"578",1,"How to Fail at Almost Everything with Scott Adams","Recorded on July 12, 2017The Dilbert comic strip artist and political philosopher Scott Adams sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. He discusses with Peter  his theory of “talent stacking,” the idea that rather than being an expert in one particular skill (i.e.,  Tiger Woods and golf), one can become successful by stacking a variety of complementary nonexpert skills. Adams demonstrates how talent stacking has been beneficial in his life because he has stacked  comic artist skills with his MBA and experience in corporate environments to create a wildly successful comic strip that resulted in spin-off books, a television series, a video game, and merchandise. His business skills gave him the tools to create a business satire comic strip and the skill set to manage the business that evolved from that  strip.  Adams also discusses how he uses his Dilbert blog to discuss his political philosophies and observations about the Trump administration. He wrote blogposts about the 2016 election and predicted that Donald Trump would win based on President Trump’s talent stack as a media mogul and businessman who had spent significant time in the public eye so  was immune to scandals and thick-skinned enough to handle what the media and other politicians would throw at him. Adams argues that President Trump is one of the best branders, influencers, and persuaders  he has ever seen, in that the president uses persuasive techniques in debates and on social media as a way to get people to do what he wants. Adams contends that President Trump’s persuasive techniques will help solve the problem of North Korea because he has already set up China to get involved by intimating that it tried and  failed. Adams believes this will cause China to get involved  to save face. Scott Adams and Peter Robinson finish by chatting about Adams’s views on the story arc of life. Adams says that  he believes he started intentionally selfish so that by the end of his life he can give away all of his wealth, knowledge, and wisdom, a process he says he has already begun. They also briefly discuss his new book, Win Bigly, about the persuasive strategies of Donald Trump. Scott Adams is releasing his new book, Win Bigly, in October 2017.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/how-fa...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

"580",1,"Thomas Sowell on the Origins of Economic Disparities","Recorded on April 1, 2019Is discrimination the reason behind economic inequality in the United States? Thomas Sowell dismisses that  question with a newly revised edition of his book Discrimination and Disparities. He sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss the long history of disparities among humans around the world and throughout time. He argues that discrimination has significantly less of a role to play in inequality than contemporary politicians give it credit for, and that something as incontrovertible as birth order of children has a more significant and statistically higher impact on success than discrimination. He discusses why parental attention is the most important aspect of a child’s intellectual development. Sowell goes on to break down different minority groups around the world who went on to have more economic and political success than their majority counterparts, such as the Indians in East Africa, Jewish people in Eastern Europe, Cubans in the United States, and the Chinese in Malaysia. He argues that there is an underlying assumption that if discrimination was absent equality would prevail, which historically has been proven wrong. Sowell goes on to discuss changes in crime rates and poverty since the expansion of US welfare programs in the 1960s and how this has had a huge impact on the success of African Americans. He talks about his own experience growing up in New York, how housing projects used to be considered a positive place to live, and his experience as the first member of his family to enter the seventh grade. Robinson asks Sowell his thoughts on the case for reparations currently being made in Congress, and Sowell presents an argument about why a plan for reparations is not only illogical but also impossible to implement, with so many US citizens’ ancestors arriving long after the Civil War. He also explains that slavery was common throughout the known world for thousands of years and that abolition movements didn’t begin anywhere in the world until the late 18th century. He reminds us that the United States was not the only country guilty of participating in slavery and yet is the only country debating reparations.

The officer did not have reasonable suspicion that a crime was occurring and was not entitled to demand Atkinson's date of birth, according to an independent review by a former U.S. Attorney.Research shows Black people are often exposed to heightened scrutiny and suspicion, which can begin early in childhood. 54% of Black Americans say they felt others 'have been suspicious of them because of the color of their skin,' compared to 6% of white Americans.Several officers, some with guns drawn, surrounded Atkinson. A college faculty member later appeared to back up Atkinson. The police officers never asked the faculty member, a white man, to confirm his identity or prove that he worked for the college.After almost 15 minutes, the officer gave Atkinson back his ID and left. The officer resigned two weeks after the incident but will remain on the city payroll until February 2020. An internal investigation found the officer violated 2 department policies but did not conclude he was racially biased.Connect with NowThis» Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook» Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter» Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram» Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_SnapchatNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.

"859",1,"A Reagan Forum with Judge Jeanine Pirro — 09/05/2018","Get the story the Fake News media doesn't want you to hear in the #1 New York Times bestseller: a withering indictment of the Deep State plot against Trump and a firsthand account of the real presidency, based on interviews with the Trump family and top administration officials.At this point in American history, we are the victims of a liberal sabotage of the presidency unlike anything we've ever witnessed. Nevertheless President Trump continues to fight every day to keep his promise to Make America Great Again. Today that bold idea has already led to a conservative judge on the Supreme Court, tax reform, and deregulation that has unleashed an economy stronger than anyone could have imagined.But there are dark forces that seek to obstruct and undermine the president and reverse the results of the 2016 presidential election. They are part of a wide-ranging conspiracy that would seem incredible if it weren't being perpetrated openly. Driven by ambition, blinded by greed, and bound by a common goal-to unseat the 45th President of the United States-this cabal is determined to maintain its wrongful hold on national political power.Jeanine Pirro is a highly respected judge, former district attorney, elected politician, sought-after legal commentator, author, and champion of women's rights. Pirro is the host of Justice with Judge Jeanine and for three years hosted Judge Jeanine Pirro, for which she won an Emmy. She also appears regularly as a legal analyst and judicial commentator on Today, Good Morning America, The Early Show, 60 Minutes, CNN, and the Fox News Channel. In 1990, she became the first elected female judge to sit on the Westchester County court bench. In 1993, Judge Pirro was also elected district attorney of Westchester County, once again setting a precedent as the first female to hold that position.

The positions held by her staffers vary from cooks to chauffeurs, but as it turns out, quite a few people on the payroll are doing jobs that seem, well, delightfully bizarre.The Master of the Horse position goes way back to the year 1340, according to Horse & Hound. While this position would have been of importance in centuries past, today the job is an honorary one. The outlet explained,""The Master is no longer involved with the day-to-day running of [the royal stables] but still makes inspections and rides in ceremonial uniform at state occasions.""In 1999, the queen appointed Lord Sam Vestey, former chairman of Cheltenham racecourse in Gloucestershire, as the new Master of the Horse. He is the ""senior officer"" in charge of the royal stables as well as the horses and carriages belonging to the queen. The Telegraph reported,""In his role he attends important ceremonial occasions when the sovereign rides on horseback or travels in horse-drawn carriage, such as at Trooping the Colour and the state opening of Parliament.""

Each year, Miss World, Miss Universe, and Miss Earth are crowned in the country. And at the Penitenciaria Feminina da Capital in Sao Paolo—South America's largest all-female maximum security prison—so is Miss Max. Unlike traditional pageants, the contestants competing for the title of Miss Max are currently serving long sentences for crimes like drug trafficking, kidnapping, and even homicide. They are, however, judged using the standard pageant criteria: beauty, poise, and talent—plus their record of good behavior. This year, LGBTQ inmates can also vie for the title of Mr. Congeniality. We travel to Sao Paolo, Brazil, to capture the days of preparation leading up to the crowning of Miss Max, which includes runway training from a professional choreographer and a day of hair and makeup courtesy of some of Brazil's best stylists. We also talk with the incarcerated contestants about how a beauty competition can help them temporarily escape the monotony of their lives behind bars.Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-BROADLYCome find us:Broadly | https://broadly.vice.comFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/BroadlyTVTwitter | https://twitter.com/broadlyTumblr | http://broadlytv.tumblr.comInstagram | https://instagram.com/broadlyPinterest | https://www.pinterest.com/broadlytvNewsletter | http://bit.ly/1JKF1oA","Vice News","3f-kl9l0bDw"

Domestic violence rates in the country have soared, marital rape is not considered a crime, those who dare to call themselves feminist activists are being detained by the government, and unmarried women older than 27 are commonly referred to as """"leftover women."""" To find out what lies behind the drastic shift in women’s social status in China, we track down feminist scholar and """"iron girl"""" Wang Zheng and spend a day with one of China’s so-called leftover women.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labCorrection at 7:48: The protester says “They are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.”Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China’s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city’s judicial independence.At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would “indefinitely suspend” the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam’s resignation.But this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong’s relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China’s favor.Watch this video to understand the news coming out of Hong Kong and the history that led up to this moment. For more watch Episode one of our Vox Borders Hong Kong episodes here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyxG...And for even more context on Hong Kong’s history with Britain you can watch another one of our Vox Borders Hong Kong episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StW7o...If you want to get real nerdy you can read Hong Kong’s Basic Law (their mini Constitution) here:https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basicl...You can also read the Sino-British Joint Declaration that defined Hong Kong when the British handed it back to China in 1997 here: http://www.gov.cn/english/2007-06/14/...And the extradition law introduced in Hong Kong that has sparked massive protests here:https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr18-19/engl...Here is a piece reported by the New York Times on the latest from Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/wo...Here are some additional resources regarding Hong Kong’s democracy and political make-up:https://sites.duke.edu/corporations/2...https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demo...https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDu...And finally, you can also find our latest articles covering the most recent developments here:https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/1868358...https://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/16/1...https://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/9/18...Thanks for watching!
