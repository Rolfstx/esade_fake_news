From the beginning of human awareness ‚Äì no matter the context and no matter the age ‚Äì the answer was always ‚Äúyes‚Äù. All cultures have universally argued that human beings are ‚Äúensouled‚Äù. About a hundred years ago, however, scientists decided that the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù is not a proper subject of scientific investigation ‚Äì consciousness replaced soul. Then, the brain replaced consciousness. Lately, this perspective has led some scientists to argue that within 20-30 years AI, robotics and biological brains will converge to create a cyborg/Matrix like reality where there is, essentially, no difference between humans and machines. Science of the Soul is a feature length documentary investigation into these life and death issues. From robotics to near death experiences, from attempts to achieve altered states of consciousness in the jungles of Peru to an exploration of infant state of mind, Science of the Soul explores the cutting-edge of consciousness related science to determine whether we are about to experience a new step in human evolution or the death of the human soul.üéû üçøüé•üìΩüé¨ Watch more free documentaries on Syndicado TV - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP5vk...üìº Syndicado TV is where you‚Äôll find an eclectic mix of mind-bending documentaries, cult classic films and investigative television documentaries. https://youtube.com/syndicadotvDiscover our other channels with free movies and tv series:‚ñ∂Ô∏è I Love Docs for documentaries: https://youtube.com/ILOVEDOCS‚ñ∂Ô∏è North of Main for Independent movies: https://youtube.com/NORTHOFMAIN‚ñ∂Ô∏è Syndicado Reality: https://youtube.com/SYNDICADOREALITY#syndicadotv #science #documentary;PT87M25S;29/03/2019;29/03/2019;164;;Syndicado TV;/channel/UCuLhRj43ZJzQV-5_im_BwQA;UCuLhRj43ZJzQV-5_im_BwQA;20;S7SQoQj9868;An eclectic mix of reality TV, mind-bending documentaries, cult classic films, and upcoming clips and trailers!;47463942;0;166000;FALSE;1511Mars brain, Venus brain: John Gray at TEDxBend;Nonprofits & Activism;1745666;35.723;1.331;An all-time bestselling author of 17 books sold in 45 languages, including Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, John Gray is arguably the world's foremost expert on relationships.

This is our April update on our previous lecture to keep all of our viewers informed on the new research and publications that have been released on COVID-19. Please be aware‚Äî This lecture is up to date as of April 17, 2020. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. ¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

Nicks went to work on ""Bella Donna"" which cemented her stature as one of rocks greatest female voices. Lindsey had already produced and/or written hit songs for Walter Egan (Magnet And Steel) then John Stewart (Gold), refining his pop style along the way and provided backing vocals with Stevie. His first solo effort was titled ""Law And Order"" and he played almost all the instruments and had guest appearances from Christine McVie and Mick Fleetwood. The single went to #9 in the US and spent three weeks at #1 in Australia, two weeks at #1 in South Africa and peaking at #31 in the UK. ""Trouble"" was written with and inspired by Richard Dashut, a producer who was their frequent collaborator. Mick Fleetwood played live on ""Trouble"" but Lindsey took a four second drum loop and that is what he used for the entire song. He ripped a page right out the Bee Gees production book by doing since they had picked out a four second loop from ""Stayin' Alive"" and used it for Night Fever and a few other songs. Buckingham overdubbed a few crashes and added percussion to that bringing in bassist George Hawkins to make the tune groove. Lindsay is particularly proud of the way the spanish guitar sounds here, and his distinctive finger plucking style lends an energy that beautifully completes the musical phrasing. The promotional video features an all male band with six drummers including Fleetwood and Andy Ward, four guitarists including Buckingham, Bob Welch, Bob Weston and Walter Egan and two bassists.";PT6M26S;21/11/2018;21/11/2018;16111;;DJDiscoCatV2;/channel/UCI7NzN_pjO1o1eoR_dhaUSg;UCI7NzN_pjO1o1eoR_dhaUSg;19;jR9CVN8gFII;I've been on and off YouTube since 2005. When they started tightening down the copyrights in 2008-09, they killed me twice and the third time I was so disgusted with the copyright take downs and illegal downloading, I shut my channel down to regroup. I got back on in early 2013 and this time I hope its gonna stick! If it doesn't, I still have another six lives to build on. I like to take the single versions of disco/pop songs and stretch them out to make extended versions of them. Nothing can replace the wonder I felt handling the vinyl singles and long plays that music so rich could come out of that. The brightly colored sleeves and labels are what I remember most, who doesn't remember the colored comet on the outer edge of the Capitol label? I try to get the cleanest vintage vinyl to do my remixes and I use Audacity to edit.

Jazz Scale Exercises should be about giving you the material you can use in your solos and help you know and play the different arpeggios and melodies found in the scale.When you improvise in Jazz then the lines or melodies that you play are related to the chords you are playing over and the solo follows the chord progression it is played over. One easy way to do this is to use the arpeggios of each chord.You can use the arpeggio of the chord you are playing over, but in fact, there are more options than this and the exercise in this lesson will help you tie all of that together in one exercise.Content:0:00 Intro0:13 Arpeggios!0:52 Improve How you Practice - Tie It All Together1:38 How to Use This and Improve your solos1:54 The Scale2:01 The Diatonic Arpeggios in the Scale2:20 A few thoughts about Scale Fingerings Systems2:42 Know what you are playing.3:39 #1 Making Music with the material from this exercise3:55 #2 Add some chromatic notes4:21 Examples #1 and #2 Slow4:30 Adding a bit of Bebop Rhythm5:12 #3 Bebop Arpeggio Lick5:33 #4  Bebop Arpeggio Lick5:54 Examples #3 and #4 Slow6:03 Do you work like this with connecting Scales and Arpeggios6:11 Finding more Arpeggios that work on a chord.6:30 Why an Arpeggio works Over a Chord7:04 Constructing another arpeggio and adding a 9th7:47 Taking this concept through a few chords8:11 #5 Using The Em7 arpeggio8:35 #6 Using The Em7 arpeggio8:57 Examples #5 and #6 Slow9:06 Finding more options for a II V I.9:46 Basic Bebop II V I with this idea9:55 Like the video?

Maybe it's because they think they have everything already, or because they're afraid it's too late. But if we don't ask ourselves what we want, there's no way we'll ever know if our dreams are possible, or what it would take to achieve them. Until recently, that was my story. I was living an amazing, beautiful life, and I didn't feel I deserved to even contemplate anything more. This talk is about why I decided to finally ask myself that question, and what happened when I did.  Although Rita Wilson is well-known as an actress and film producer, her most recent projects have all been connected to her passion for music. After achieving her dream in 2012 with the critically acclaimed album AM/FM - an intimate, elegant, and beautifully sung collection of classics from the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s - Wilson has been focusing on a new component of her musical career as a songwriter. Recently, she has collaborated with a number of talented and successful songwriters, composing original material featured on her second album, self-titled Rita Wilson. Her new album Halfway to Home (March 2019) has a fuller sound: Southern California rock meets Nashville country, co-produced by Rita Wilson and Nathan Chapman with additional production from Ron Aniello and John Shanks.

He is a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a senior fellow at both the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and the Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute. His March 24, 2020, article in the Wall Street Journal questions the premise that ‚Äúcoronavirus would kill millions without shelter-in-place orders and quarantines.‚Äù In the article he suggests that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs little evidence to confirm that premise‚Äîand projections of the death toll could plausibly be orders of magnitude too high.‚Äù In this edition of Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson we asked Dr. Bhattacharya to defend that statement and describe to us how he arrived at this conclusion. We get into the details of his research, which used data collected from hotspots around the world and his background as a doctor, a medical researcher, and an economist. It‚Äôs not popular right now to question conventional wisdom on sheltering in place, but Dr. Bhattacharya makes a strong case for challenging it, based in economics and science.

As this documentary shows, it has - among other things - played along with arms deals made by German shipping companies.Top secret operations are carried out silently, bypassing the federal authorities by exploiting a blind spot between the Foreign Trade and the War Weapons Control Acts. The weapons are not shipped from Germany, but via a secret port in Ukraine that does not appear on any map. The trail leads to Kyiv, where a former Ukrainian president confirms the existence of the port and the ""delicate‚Äù arms deals. For the first time, the chief of the country‚Äôs secret service acknowledges that German companies are involved in the shipping of military weapons via the Ukraine, and provides the film team with the first and only television pictures of the secret port. Research in the USA throws up more alarming indications. American satellite images show the port where heavy-lift carriers load tanks, howitzers and other military equipment. At least two German shipping companies are involved in the operation. The plethora of secret documents points in particular to a former world market leader in the heavy-lift cargo business, the Bremen-based in Beluga shipping company, which has since ceased trading. Four of its ships are explicitly named. Loading and stowage lists show that the shipping company repeatedly planned and shipped armaments - and one man, a BND officer with the code name ""Klaus Hollmann,‚Äù was always involved. The German parliament only found out about the BND‚Äôs involvement in the arms deliveries through the makers of this film and is now trying to get to the bottom of the affair. Intelligence experts see this as an important step in averting further damage to German Democracy.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

While this video is older and I've discovered how to really accelerate your vision progress even faster, using your peripheral still applies. I further explain an even faster approach in the next video in the series. I also realized the similarities between Endmyopia Active Focing and Bates Method Swinging. Find out more here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfO0x...More info here:https://www.myopiaismental.comDisclaimer: I am not a medical professional and I don‚Äôt have all the answers to every eye problem out there. If you have some serious eye conditions then seek medical help for that. I‚Äôm just a guy who figured something out that is correcting my vision problems that I‚Äôve lived with for over 35 years. If you send me questions or comments like; will this work for me or I have a prescription of ‚Ä¶. can you fix‚Ä¶. or my eye doctor said this doesn‚Äôt work, etc, I will probably not respond. I‚Äôm also not going to respond to debates on the bates method or other natural vision correction. I know what is working for me and I‚Äôm only sharing what I‚Äôm experiencing with others so they too can be glasses free if they choose. I can honestly say the first time you experience crystal clear vision without your glasses you‚Äôll want to work even harder so it clear all the time.";PT17M39S;06/02/2019;06/02/2019;9555;;Learning with Mark Warren;/channel/UCHdhi8gzARec7IrzK98FIkA;UCHdhi8gzARec7IrzK98FIkA;20;UxW3KfH8llg;This channel will contain mostly tutorial information for photography, music and video.;3124223;0;27100;FALSE;939 5 Inch 4140 Gearbox Shaft Part 3;Science & Technology;675916;16.767;193;"Final video for this series.

When I‚Äôm not working in the hospital or pulmonary clinic, I‚Äôm at home working on making these videos for you, to deliver you accurate medical expertise, to the best of my ability (especially during this pandemic). This virus, we know, is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, and through contact, by getting into our mucosa, like our mouth, nose, and eyes. Although less common, it also can be transmitted through aerosol, meaning airborne. Most likely when you have people in an enclosed space, such as an elevator, and someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouths, and someone else can inhale it in. This virus attaches to cells in our body by this ACE2 receptor. This ACE2 receptor is only located on certain cells in our body. It's on our tongue, in our nose, back of the throat, and in our lungs. Specifically, within the lungs, it's only located on our type II alveolar cells. We know that ARDS develops in about 4 to 5% of COVID-19 patients. And of all the people who get COVID19, the mortality rate is around 1 to 2%. So why do some COVID-19 patients get ARDS, and why do some die? There are different reasons, and let's talk about them. It could be one of these reasons, but more likely it‚Äôs a combination of these reasons.1) The virus only gains entry into our cells that express the ACE2 receptor. They are located in multiple sites. Besides being in the lung, they‚Äôre in your mouth, nose, throat, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and testes.2) It makes sense that if the virus only gets into your mouth or nose or throat, but not the lungs, that it would cause only cold-like symptoms. But if the virus gets all the way down into the alveoli of your lungs, that‚Äôs what's going to cause ARDS.  And by the way, the ACE2 receptors in your gut probably explains why some patients get nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 3) The amount of virus that you get into your body likely determines how sick you get. This is what we call the viral load. 4) The inflammatory reaction that occurs with COVID-19 is extremely complicated with lots of different proteins and hormones and interleukins at play. But there are several known genetic polymorphisms of these proteins that likely make some people more prone to getting worse illnesses than others. A genetic polymorphism simply means a variation on a particular gene. For example, there are genetic polymorphisms for the ACE gene, as well as IL-6. Basically, a lot of it just comes down to our genes.   And sex. 5) Because the 5th reason has to do with estrogen. Estrogen is known to inhibit the effects of IL-6, which plays a huge role in this cytokine storm. This might explain why women overall have less severe disease compared to men. 6) And the 6th reason is because of people who are already taking certain medications. For those people who are already on and ACEI such as lisinopril, or an ARB such as losartan, or telmisartan, or candesartan, or irbesartan. Or people who take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or rheumatoid disease. Or people who take tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor. Are these patients less prone to getting severe illness? My guess is yes.

This is where the direct attack on other organs that have ACE2 receptors can occur, including heart muscle, kidneys, blood vessels, liver, and the brain. Early findings, including those from multiple autopsy and biopsy reports, show that viral particles can be found not only in the nasal passages and throat, but also in tears, stool, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and heart. One case report found evidence of viral particles in the CSF, meaning the fluid around the brain. That patient had meningitis. So the virus is sometimes going to all these different organs by means of attaching to the ACE2 receptors that are there, but that‚Äôs not even the whole story. Because in some cases, by the time the body‚Äôs immune system figures out the body are being invaded, it's like unleashing the military to stomp out the virus, and in that process, there‚Äôs a ton of collateral damage.  This is what we refer to as the cytokine storm. When the virus gets into the alveolar cells, meaning the tiny little air sacs within the lungs, it makes a ton of copies of itself and goes onto invading more cells. The alveoli‚Äôs next-door neighbor is guessed who, yeah, the tiniest blood vessels in our body, capillaries. And the lining of those capillaries is called the endothelium, which also has ACE2 receptors. And once the virus invades the capillaries. It means that it serves as the trigger for the onslaught of inflammation AND clotting. And Early autopsy results are also showing widely scattered clots in multiple organs. In one study from the Netherlands, 1/3rd of hospitalized with COVID-19 got clots despite already being on prophylactic doses of blood thinners. So not only are you getting the inflammation with the cytokine storm, but you‚Äôre also forming blood clots, that can travel to other parts of the body, and cause major blockages, effectively damaging those organs. So wait a minute doc, you‚Äôre telling me that this can cause organ damage by 1) Directly attacking organs by their ACE2 receptor? Yup2) Indirectly attacking organs by way of collateral damage from the cytokine storm? Yup3) Indirectly cause damage to organs by means of blood clots? yup 4) Indirectly cause damage as a result of low oxygen levels, improper ventilator settings, drug treatments themselves, and/or all of these things combined? YeahEndothelial cells are more vulnerable to dying in people with preexisting endothelial dysfunction, which is more often associated with being a male, being a smoker, having high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Blood clots can form and/or travel to other parts of the body. When blood clots travel to the toes, and cause blockages in blood flow there, meaning ischemia or infarction, that can cause gangrene there. And lots of times patients with gangrene require amputation, and ‚ÄúCOVID toes‚ÄùSo is antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), the cause of all these blood clots in patients with severe COVID? Maybe. Some patients with APS have what‚Äôs called catastrophic APS, where these patients can have strokes, seizures, heart attacks, kidney failure, ARDS, skin changes like the ones I mentioned. Viral infectious diseases, particularly those of the respiratory tract, have been reported as being the triggers for CAPS.Various factors increase the risk of developing arterial thrombosis. Classically, the cardiovascular-dependent risk factors implicated in clotting have been hypertension, meaning high blood pressure, high levels of cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, age, chemotherapy, and degree of infection. All of these contribute toward developing arterial thrombosis.A lot of patients with severe COVID-19 have certain labs that resemble DIC, such as increased PT/INR, increased PTT, decreased levels of platelets. But the reason why these COVID patients who developed clots in the study I mentioned earlier, the reason why they don‚Äôt have DIC, is actually 2 reasons, one, they weren‚Äôt having extensive bleeding, and two, they did not have low fibrinogen levels. And if its truly DIC, you would have both of those things. Anyway, you can probably glean from this video why it's so hard for doctors to figure out what is going on with this virus.  Between the variable ways this disease can present in different patients, and the different ways that organs can suffer damage, yeah, this is really, really really, complicated.Are BLOOD CLOTS the reason why COVID19 patients are dying?Video Link - https://youtu.be/qoJ4VDaGSfYDr. Mike Hansen, MDInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care MedicineWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/#coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19;PT13M4S;06/05/2020;06/05/2020;1331;Least Biased;Doctor Mike Hansen;/channel/UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A;UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A;20;KzKvIYwqQkE;"Mike Hansen, MD, is a medical doctor who is an internist, an intensivist, and a pulmonologist.

I like to get numbers. So I'm getting reports in weekly in some businesses, but that doesn't tell me what the economy's going to six months from now or three months from now. It tells me what's going on now with our businesses. And it really doesn't make any difference in what I do today in terms of buying stocks or buying businesses what those numbers tell me.

This documentary is hosted by the esteemed historian Craig Symonds who brings the Battle of Midway to life for us.Video OverviewThe Battle of Midway was a clash between the American fleet and the Japanese Navy which marked a pivotal turning point in the Pacific Theater. We begin with an overview of the Japanese strategy and their unbroken string of victories in the first 6 months of the war from the Battle of Pearl Harbor to the Battle of the Coral Sea. At this point it has become apparent that control of the Pacific will be determined by aircraft carrier dominance. Thus Admiral Yamamoto resolves to draw the American Fleet out of Pearl Harbor by launching a sneak attack on Midway.However the US has already broken the Japanese codes thanks to Operation Hypo and knows of the incoming attack. Nimitz decides to set his own counter trap by sending his 3 aircraft carriers to point luck, just north of Midway to intercept the Imperial Japanese Navy. The battle of Midway begins with Japanese planes bombing the Pacific atoll. American planes from the island retaliate with their own bombers and torpedoes throughout the morning. These score no hits but have the critical effect of delaying the preparation of Japanese aircraft.At this point, Japan detects US forces to the north and prepares to turn to meet them. But by this time the US Navy has already launched its own places. The first wave to arrive are the torpedo bombers. Though they score no hits either, they draw the defensive Japanese fighters away from the next wave of dive bombers which manage to knock out 3 carriers in just a few minutes. The Kaga, the Akagi, and the Soryu all go down.The only remaining Japanese carrier, the Hiryu, launches a counter strike which hits the USS Yorktown and eventually sinks it. But a final US attack by the USS Hornet and USS Enterprise takes out this last carrier. Hearing this news, Admiral Yamamoto calls off the rest of his fleet and returns to Japan. America has just turned the tide of the war.You can watch the Midway 2019 movie trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9laR...I'll be doing my own Midway review soon.#History#Midway;PT23M48S;09/11/2019;09/11/2019;1113;Least Biased;Invicta;/channel/UCwO-UgquohXwoe7f0e6lMnw;UCwO-UgquohXwoe7f0e6lMnw;19;wyFZ3cJRrcg;"Welcome to Invicta, the home for history documentary videos on fascinating people and places from the past.

How much is enough? Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn‚Äôt the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.Check out our web special:http://www.dw.com/en/tv/greed/s-32898_______Exciting, powerful and informative ‚Äì DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

But now vigilantes are using the paedophiles‚Äô own techniques against them. Leading the chase are people like Stinson Hunter, the Paedophile Hunter. This Sunday, Allison Langdon joins Stinson on the hunt for paedophiles and while the ethics are questionable, the results are undeniable.

Two billion years ago life first appeared on earth, a planet bathed in a natural electromagnetic frequency. As life slowly evolved from simple to complex organisms, it did so surrounded by this frequency, forming a harmonic relationship with it, a relationship that science is just beginning to comprehend. New research is showing that exposure to this frequency is vital to human beings. It controls our mental and physical health, it synchronizes our circadian rhythms, it aids our immune system, and it improves our overall sense of well-being.

But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.Here‚Äôs where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether healthy people should also wear masks to protect themselves from infection.The truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won‚Äôt get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they‚Äôre most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.But experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks matters a lot less when you consider one of Covid-19‚Äôs most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease‚Äôs long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it‚Äôs almost impossible to be completely sure that you don‚Äôt already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.More of Vox.com's coverage of face masks: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/31/2119813...An in-depth explainer on viral respiratory particle behavior and covid-19 transmission: https://medium.com/@Cancerwarrior/cov...The US Center for Disease Control's current guidance on face masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-...An MIT disease transmission researcher's study on respiratory droplets and aerosols: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama...Ed Yong's great explainer on the confusion around face masks: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/ar...For the full Schlieren mirror video from Bauhaus University, Weimar: https://vimeo.com/399120258The World Health Organization's updated recommendations on face mask use: https://www.who.int/publications-deta...Our source for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases: https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-relea...The headline on this piece has been updated.

We‚Äôve spent hours studying a new topic ‚Äî only to get frustrated weeks later when we can‚Äôt recall the key ideas.

We‚Äôve received ‚Äútextbook‚Äù medical explanations that often lack clinical context and fail to highlight the most important concepts. 

MedCram.com offers a dramatically more efficient, engaging, fun, and lasting way to learn and review medical topics. MedCram was founded in 2012 by Dr. Roger Seheult and one of his former PA students, Kyle Allred, with one word in mind: CLARITY

This recipe takes up to 3 days to make, which might seem a little bit crazy, but we promise you the results are worth it.Get the full recipe here https://www.ilovecooking.ie/food-tv/b...________________________________________________(We've had a few comments about the preferment being a little too dry and not looking like Patrick's in the video. He's double checked his numbers and realised he meant to say that you need 290ml water in the preferment. Apologies for the mistake! But, it's a good excuse to try another batch üòâSo, for the preferment:450g strong (bread) flour7g salt290ml water5g fresh yeast (or generous pinch dried yeast)The rest of the recipe stays the same.)________________________________________________This dough produces 6-8 baguettes and the dough can be held in a fridge for up to 36 hours. If you do not wish to bake all the dough at once, simply take what you need, shape it and bake it, leaving the remainder of the dough in the fridge which you can return to at any time within that 36-hour time period. This will allow you to bake fresh baguettes day after day.Or, bake all the baguettes in one go and freeze them. They're easily brought back to their crispy state by thawing at room temperature then dampening with water and heating the oven for about 10 minutes.Don't forget, we love to see what you've been baking, so please find us on our social channels and show us what you've made!Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ilovecooking...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ilovecookin...Twitter: @ilovecookingire And you can find Patrick on his socialsFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/firehousebread/Instagram: @firehousebread;PT18M23S;27/01/2020;27/01/2020;11355;;ilovecookingireland;/channel/UCh5czuQIYFeEYeXi3_7-iDQ;UCh5czuQIYFeEYeXi3_7-iDQ;19;n0U8RdRdFDU;Easy tried and tested recipes.

Peter Fenwick describes the different transitional phases of the dying process and highlights the importance of letting go at the end of ones life.He offers fascinating insights into common phenomena at the end of life, such as premonitions, seeing a light, death-bed-visions and coincidences. In his opinion everybody should know about death and the dying process, because it is a normal part of living.Contents:00:08 What is a neuropsychiatrist?00:46 What does your daily work involve?02:14 In broad terms, what can we learn from these scans?03:18 How did you get involved with near-death experiences?04:18 How did you go about studying these phenomena? 07:35 Did you get the whole spectrum of near-death experiences?09:00 Is that dependent on your worldview, on your background?09:19 What do you think is the value of NDE research?10:25 Do you think that near-death experiences provide some kind of proof that consciousness can exist without a brain?15:33 Can you tell us about  the end-of-life phenomena which you describe in your book?22:53 So there are visitors and spiritual beings.

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s.

On Thursday, Canada reached a testing milestone with more than one million Canadians having been tested for COVID-19. But as Heather Yourex-West explains, there could (and should) be much more done.By and large children have been spared during this pandemic. Experts are unsure why, but kids who test positive rarely develop many serious symptoms. But as Crystal Goomansingh reports, a baffling new syndrome that may be related to COVID-19 is emerging in a small number of children. What does it mean for your kids?Abigail Bimman joins us with the latest reaction from Alberta after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday disagreed with Green Party MP Elizabeth May, who said on Wednesday that ‚Äúoil is dead‚Äù in Canada, and with Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, who said layer that same day that the oil industry shouldn't be bailed out.And finally tonight, Eric Sorensen looks at Canada's media landscape: where big and small companies are feeling the pinch left by large internet companies.MORE: https://globalnews.ca/national/progra...For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#CoronavirusOutbreak #GlobalNews #COVID-19Outbreak;PT21M55S;07/05/2020;07/05/2020;13144;Left-Center;Global News;/channel/UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg;UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg;20;Ef3iXUzLVMo;"Welcome to the official Global News channel on YouTube.

When Evangelical Christian mom Susan Cottrell‚Äôs daughter came out, she faced an impossible choice: her LGBTQ child or her non-affirming church. In this heartwarming talk, Susan explains why she chose her LGBTQ child and how she fights for progress inside the Christian Church. Susan Cottrell is a prominent voice for faith parents of LGBTQI children. She is an international speaker, acclaimed author, and public theologian with a Masters in Theological Studies. After spending 25 years in the Evangelical church, she founded FreedHearts to champion the LGBTQI community and their families. She served as the Vice-President of PFLAG Austin (Texas) and was endorsed by The Human Rights Campaign and The Gay Christian Network. She has five children, two of whom are in the LGBTQI community, with her husband of 30 years, Rob.

Before attempting to remove any bolt, it is a good idea to shock the bolt first, then apply some heat and finally some spray penetrant (once it is cool). Drilling out the bolt is one of the few options that will work in this scenario. In this video I show two techniques that could potentially work when a bolt is broken in a deep hole or a bolt is sheared in an aluminium component.

I'm Andong, a Berlin-based food YouTuber, exploring the world in the pursuit of good food, cooking techniques and the stories behind those things.

I discovered my passion for food when I lived in China. I have since returned to Germany, become a filmmaker and make weekly videos about food, culture and cooking!

I started this channel in 2018. I've been on YouTube for ages though - feel free to check my super old and cringy content, partly consisting of mandarin rap videos that went viral in China. I'm leaving them up cause I think they're awkward and fun. But I'm all about food now, I promise! 

You're welcome to join the club and bring the world a little closer by sharing and learning about our food cultures.

And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.Editor's note:From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself‚Äîin 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts‚Äô opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.Some of our viewers felt the #documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.#wuhan #VirusOrigin--------Sign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party‚ñ∂Ô∏èhttps://ccpvirustruth.com---------Subscribe: http://bit.ly/2vhu9EjContact us or make a donation via PayPal: chinainfocus@ntdtv.orgSupport us: https://www.ntd.com/support-us.htmlTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChinaInFocusNTDFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NTDChinainFocusWebsite: https://www.ntd.com/china-in-focus---------Watch more: Exclusive: Wuhan funeral home staffer reveals real death toll of coronavirus: https://bit.ly/3bpMTBsCCP virus follows communist China ties: https://bit.ly/2UsNVWcGiving the right name to the virus causing a global pandemic: https://bit.ly/2wzV3IBUndercover video reveals new evidence on forced organ harvesting in China: https://bit.ly/2wBE7RRFull movie: ‚ÄòClaws of the Red Dragon‚Äô exposes connection between Huawei and CCP: https://bit.ly/2wW1R3C------------------Get the latest updates as well as exclusive reporting and first-hand videos about the CCP virus from The Epoch Times website.‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://www.theepochtimes.com/ccp-virusUpdated on April 14, 2020.";PT54M18S;07/04/2020;07/04/2020;1915;Right-Center;China in Focus - NTD;/channel/UCBOqkAGTtzZVmKvY4SwdZ2g;UCBOqkAGTtzZVmKvY4SwdZ2g;20;Le_rfTdayLs;"""China in Focus"" is a new Youtube channel created by NTD to provide viewers with fast, compelling, first-hand news from China.

Usually these questions come from patients who are dealing with pain either in their necks or lower backs.These conditions can be limiting and debilitating on so many levels; one thing that is often affected his sleep.Today I wanted to share with you five tips to ensure you are getting your best sleep possible even despite1. The best sleeping position for you is one that is comfortable and holds your spine in the correct posture: The bottom line is the best sleeping position for you is which ever position you find to be the most comfortable while keeping your spine in as neutral a position as possible. Make sure you are aware of your spine alignment front to back, side to side, as well as if you are rotating or not.2. To get the right posture you need the right support: In order to achieve a correct, neutral spine posture, you need to have the right support from your mattress and from your pillow.Mattress: It is recommended that you replace your mattress every 8-10 years. If patients come to me who wake up with pain/stiffness in their spine often they‚Äôre sleeping on an older mattress. If it‚Äôs been a decade since you got a new mattress it might be time.Pillow: I make pillow recommendations based solely on two things - body type and sleeping posture. I would recommend a different pillow for someone with a petite frame versus a larger frame. Similarly, it you slept primarily on your back my recommendation would be different than if you slept primarily on your side.3. Stomach Sleep: DON‚ÄôT DO IT! This is the worst of all the postures you can sleep in through the night. It maximally rotates your neck all night, it puts your lower back in an extended position, and it puts pressure on your internal organs. Stop sleeping on your stomach.4. Side Sleepers: Again the goal is to achieve as close to neutral spine as possible. This is achieved with proper support for your head/neck, torso, and hips/legs.Head and neck: you want a pillow that supports your neck in a neutral position. If your pillow is too full your neck will be bent too much up towards the ceiling. If your pillow is too flat your head will be bent too much down towards your bed. Try to find the right pillow to achieve a neutral spine position.Torso: Again, this is where the right mattress comes into play. It needs to be firm enough to support the side of your trunk but soft enough to unload your shoulders and hips (areas of higher pressure). You can also get small pillows designed specifically to achieve this goal. Click here to see these pillows:Hips: Oftentimes when we sleep on our sides our top leg rests on top of our bottom leg putting pressure on your knees, pulling on your hips, and pulling your spine out of alignment. My solution here is to sleep with a pillow between your knees to unload stress at all three of these areas. You can even get pillows that specifically go between your legs that are intended for side sleepers; check out this link to get yours:5. Back sleepers: Back sleepers are typically a little more prone to snoring, but if you can handle that it‚Äôs a really good position for your back! Again, the whole goal here will be getting your spine into a correct position and supporting it there.Head and neck: Again - you want just the right amount of support to maintain your head/neck at the correct angle. If your pillow is too full, you‚Äôll spend all night with your neck flexed up. If your pillow is too flat, you‚Äôll spend all night with your head extended and your neck unsupported. Typically your pillow should be smaller if you sleep on your back than it would be if you preferred to sleep on your side.Hips: Oftentimes laying out flat on our backs puts a lot of stress on our lower back due to hip flexors pulling on our spine. I always recommend that if you sleep on your back you do so with 1-2 pillows under your knees to unload some pressure in your spine. You can also buy different wedge-shaped pillows designed specifically for this purpose.

And in China it‚Äôs even forbidden to be on the streets without a mask. Here in Europe, we have mixed feelings about wearing masks.

Ep.70"" we explore the music of metal legends Pantera.#pantera #dimebagdarrell #metalPantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers ‚Äì drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell ‚Äì along with lead vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing Tommy D. Bradford, who was the unofficial original. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released Power Metal in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's Cowboys from Hell, Pantera introduced the groove metal genre, while its 1992 follow-up Vulgar Display of Power exhibited an even heavier sound. Far Beyond Driven (1994) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. In addition to their contribution to the groove metal genre, Pantera is credited (along with Sepultura and Machine Head) for being part of the second wave of thrash metal scene in the early-to-mid 1990s.THE BEATO CLUB ‚Üí https://flatfiv.co/pages/become-a-bea...THE BEATO EAR TRAINING PROGRAM: https://beatoeartraining.com/BUY THE BEATO BOOK HERE ‚Üí http://bit.ly/2uTQFloMY HELIX PRESETS  ‚Üíhttps://flatfiv.co/products/rick-beat...KEMPER PROFILES ‚Üí https://flatfiv.co/collections/rick-b...Follow my Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/rickbeato1/**Advanced Harmonic Concepts for Composition and Improvisation Video Course** ‚Üí www.flatfiv.coSUBSCRIBE HERE ‚Üí http://bit.ly/2eEs9gXBEATO MUSIC FORUM ‚Üí forum.rickbeato.com‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîMy Links to Follow:YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/RickBeatoPersonal Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/rick.beato.1Follow On Twitter - @rickbeato‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîSpecial Thanks to My Supporters:Bill MillerGabriel KaraffaJoel MartinoBrett BottomleyMatthew PorterFrederick HumphreyFrederick HumphreyPaul NoonanMansel IsmayGreg SpielmanRay RossettiEvgeny TeilorJoe AnsaldiDavid FugitROBERT JOHNSONJonathan Wentworth-LintonKevin HansenSteve ThordarsonHarry BrociousJeff McClellandPzzMarc AlanRob KlineTim WilsonCalvin WellsDavid TrapaniAbel JamesEric FaroWill ElricsHector MedinaDoug OlanderScott SchumannJoe ElrodChris DefendorfDebbie ValleDan SullivanGhostly BeardRip WinklerDennis Tomlinsonmaydad meiriJP RosatoScott RanceDave HawkeyRoger FrankhamChris MitchellZack KirkorianOrion LetiziMike VoloshenAshley ThompsonMatt PauleyPeter PillitteriJeremy HickersonTravis Ahrenholtz";PT13M44S;29/06/2019;29/06/2019;1122;;Rick Beato;/channel/UCJquYOG5EL82sKTfH9aMA9Q;UCJquYOG5EL82sKTfH9aMA9Q;18;4VACz7M2D9M;Everything Music;167895694;0;1500000;FALSE;715Kent Leppink Murder | Was Mechele Linehan Guilty? | Mental Health & Personality;Education;11276;661;10;This video answers the questions: Can I analyze the mental health and personality factors at work in the Kent Leppink murder case?

I don‚Äôt just love gardening, it is my passion and other than my family and friends, it is my life.  I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. 

Now, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.

We spend about eighty percent of our day at work, the rest is at home. If we have a bad day at work we are likely to take that negativity home with us and vice versa. It is of paramount importance that we create healthy environments in the spaces that most affect our lives by giving of our best and receiving the like in return. The 5 Chairs is a powerful and systematic method which helps us master our own behaviours and manage the behaviours of others. To be a good leader is to contribute to the success and happiness of everyone, at work and at home, on a conscious level. The 5 Chairs offer 5 Choices. Which will you choose?Behavioral Coach, Corporate Trainer, Author of ‚Äò5 Chairs 5 Choices‚Äô. Louise Evans heads up her own organization in Florence, Italy from which she offers international leadership development, cross-cultural transitional coaching and personal development programmes for individuals and teams working in international contexts. She is English but has lived and worked in Germany, France and for the last 30 years in Italy. Three things have always been important in her life - people, travel and the performing arts - all three of which she combines in her daily work. Having travelled to seven-five countries and experienced culture shock three times, Louise brings multiple perspectives to the present moment to help people connect across their differences. Louise believes deeply in people‚Äôs ability to grow and transform. What she values most is helping people strengthen their self-awareness and their understanding of others so that they bring their best selves into the world in every situation.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

As you can see I spent a considerable amount of time covering Nagumo‚Äôs Dilemma. To me it's one of most striking examples of how tough it can be for a commander to make a decision based on the information at hand. I found that to be the most interesting aspect of the battle. I don‚Äôt have a Patreon but if you want to show appreciation for my work feel free to donate. ¬ª patreon -https://www.paypal.me/montemayorytcha...Corrections: ""Strength"" , ""Auxiliary"", and ""unknown"" are misspelled in the video. At 22:55 I should have stated ‚ÄúNorth of Midway‚Äù instead of Northeast of Midway. The illustration shows a 10 degree 240 nm from midway location. Not so Northeast as I audibly stated.At 23:43 I should have stated 79 aircraft instead of 78 and I should have displayed 35 instead of 34 torpedo bombers. the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù came about because sources still differ on whether there were 27 or 26 Carrier attack planes (Kates). If it was 27 it would have been 79 Planes. if it was 26 it would have been 78. During the recording I somehow mixed up the numbers. Additional Notes:notice that the carriers started off the battle in a box formation. This provided further mutual support for their rather weak AA fire. however, due to the incessant air attacks from VT-8, VT-6 and VT-3, the carriers were never able to reform in a box formation, instead they were in a ragged line which further worsened their AA capabilities. -----------------------------------------Spoiler Below regarding Nagumo's Dilemma---------------------------------------------So what was the answer to Nagumo‚Äôs Dilemma?‚ÄúTaking all together, and admittedly operating with the benefit of hindsight, the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer to Nagumo‚Äôs conundrum probably should have emphasized maneuver, offensive speed in preference to mass, and passive damage control. With fifteen minutes in which to act, he didn‚Äôt really have time to implement anything terribly fancy. But he could have helped himself immensely by immediately spotting every strike airplane in his hangars, whether they were armed or not, and launching them at the Americans. The sixty-four armed aircraft he had in had were perfectly capable of doing enormous damage to his enemy. And by emptying his hangars, he removed the single greatest danger to his carriers --- the presence of fueled and armed aircraft within them.‚Äù Parshall, Jonathan B.; Tully, Anthony P.: Shattered Sword.

When you touch it it feels tight and contracted despite your efforts to relax that area.Muscle knots can also feel swollen and inflamed and can contribute to other associated problems including headaches, stress, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping.Muscle knots are a common condition that I see in patients in my physical therapy clinic all the time. Fortunately there's a lot that you can do about them to treat them safely and effectively right at home!Today I wanted to share some of my favorite tips, tricks, and exercises to help you get rid of muscle knots in your neck, shoulders, and upper back. I've also included video demonstration of each of these methods to ensure you do them correctly and maximize your outcomes.HOW TO TREAT MUSCLE KNOTSKeep in mind that treating your muscle knots can take some time. You didn't develop them overnight; chances are they're not going to go away overnight, also.To treat your muscle knots you'll need to break up the knotted tissue and calm down the inflamed nerves.Below you'll find a list of the most effective methods to alleviate your muscle knots at home.1. Heat: applying heat to an area causes capillaries to dilate, thereby promoting more blood flow into that area. Increasing blood flow to a muscle can be an effective means of getting knots to release.2. Stretching: muscle knots are areas of the muscle that fail to fully relax/elongate. Stretching the muscles in which these knots lie is an effective way to stretch out the knot, 3. Muscle Activation: by working the muscle in which your knot lies you can increase blood flow into that spot and promote relaxation. Contracting these muscles is also a good way to fatigue this area and get the muscle knot to release.4. Postural Correction: poor posture is one of the primary contributing factors predisposing one to muscle knots. Taking actions to correct poor posture and promote improved alignment can significantly improve muscle tension and pain.5. Postural Strengthening and Muscle Activation: Stretching the tight structures through the front of the chest and shoulders while strengthening the weak muscles of your upper back in between your shoulder blades is key in improving posture and decreasing propensity for muscle knots.NO-EQUIPMENT BACK WORKOUT: https://youtu.be/nfsQW1uGoBg6. Massage: massaging muscle tissue is a great way to decrease tension and ""break up"" those chronic muscle contractions. We decrease tension and promote blood flow into an area when we massage it, so massage is great at alleviating muscle knots and associated pain.7. Trigger Point Release: Trigger point release is applying a deep pressure directly on a muscle knot and maintaining that pressure 15-60 seconds. The theory here is that we actually compress capillaries and ""starve"" the knot of blood and oxygen. After the muscle fibers ""release"" we then release our pressure and blood/oxygen comes rushing back into the spot, thereby maintaining the relaxed state.";PT15M23S;12/10/2018;12/10/2018;6525;;Tone and Tighten;/channel/UCJASBOyF4Fkd26SIwRhLuZw;UCJASBOyF4Fkd26SIwRhLuZw;20;9PC9Mn0VO00;Hi - I'm Jared!

Cassandra Sainsbury certainly isn‚Äôt. Three years ago, ‚ÄòCocaine Cassie‚Äô as we've come to know her, was locked up in a Colombian prison for attempting to smuggle almost six kilograms of the drug out of the country. As well as incarceration, her punishment included lashings of public ridicule for being so foolish. Cassie Sainsbury has now been freed, and a new woman has emerged from the cells.

The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. For the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gr√∂ner, one of Germany‚Äôs biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. ""If you have great wealth, you can‚Äôt fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,‚Äù Gr√∂ner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts.  ""Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we‚Äôre more independent,‚Äù Gr√∂ner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanoviƒá, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. ""These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,"" Milanoviƒá notes. ""Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?‚Äù_______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

It has nine symptom criteria, five of which are required for a diagnosis.1: Grandiose sense of self-importance 2: Fantasies 3: Special or unique4: Requires excessive admiration 5: Sense of entitlement 6: Manipulative 7: Lacks empathy for others 8: Often envious 9: Arrogant attitudes or behaviorsAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Haim Bodek, aka The Algo Arms Dealer. After Quants: the Alchemists of Wall Street and Money & Speed: Inside the Black Box. This is the final episode of a trilogy in search of the winners and losers of the tech revolution on Wall Street. Trading on the financial market is not longer dominated by humans, but by super fast computers and algorithms. The result of this digital revolution on Wall Street is a complex and fragmented financial system that is hard to understand and overseen. A system that we are all connected to. The only people who understand the system a bit, are the people who built it.Haim Bodek started his own high frequency trading in 2007 and built a from his point of view perfect and fast algorithm. One day it just stopped working. Profits disappeared en he went looking for the cause. He decided to go public with his search to display the rotten system.

Life is short, be at the EDGE of knowledge.

We aim to permanently AWAKEN humanity to its collective union with evolution, create the world‚Äôs largest open knowledge database, and provide equal degrees of economic freedom for everyone to self-actualize.

None of our content will ever be paywalled. We plan to fill sports stadiums with curious intellectuals, build creative warehouses, and execute the next generation of planetary architectures that maximize collective flourishing.

The questions we love asking are multidisciplinary and nuanced.

How do we maximize human potential?
What do we do about wealth inequality?
Are we alone in the cosmos?
Who will teach AI ethics?
How can democracy be modernized?
What is consciousness?
Are we in a simulation?

May civilization live long and prosper.

They found that low relative humidities of 20%‚Äì35% were most favorable for infection, while the transmission was completely blocked at high humidity of 80%.They also found that when guinea pigs were kept at 5 ¬∞C, transmission occurred with greater frequency than at 20 ¬∞C, while at 30 ¬∞C, no transmission was detected.The authors concluded that low relative humidities produced by indoor heating and coldtemperatures favored the spread of the influenza virus.I also want to add, that cold weather, by itself, can cause a runny nose without necessarilyhaving a cold, and this allows for the virus so be carried in those secretions, which probably facilitates transmission.40% of common colds are caused by rhinoviruses. The second most common cause ofcold is the coronavirus, the normal one, not this novel coronavirus, aka SARS-CoV-2.Its been shown that the rhinovirus reproduces more quickly at cooler temperatures means you might catch a cold more quickly if you‚Äôre chilly.And this probably applies to the coronavirus as well.It's likely that with the combination of all of these 5 factors, meaning, cooler temp, lowerhumidity, people staying indoors more often in winter months, cold weather causing runny noses and our immune system is more active when it's warmer, these combinations of factors likely explain why colds, flu,, and COVID-19 are more likely to cause infections in the winter months.But there is likely a 6th factor as well. And that is vitamin D. Our bodies don‚Äôt normally make vitamin D unless we get sunlight. In the winter months, for most of us in this world, we don‚Äôt get enough sunlight to make enough vitamin D. Unless you live in a warm climate, then maybe you are the exception. So if you aren‚Äôt getting enough sunlight in the winter months, that means you have to get enough vitamin D in your diet. And if you don‚Äôt do that, you will have low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D helps regulate or Calcium levels and is important for bone and muscle health. It also plays a role in regulating our immune system, but its exact role is not known.Why is this important when it comes to the common cold, flu, and perhaps with this novelthe coronavirus that‚Äôs causing COVID-19? Well, vitamin D doesn‚Äôt affect these viruses themselves. Instead, it affects our immune systems.So what is my recommendation for taking Vitamin D?The best thing to do is check with your doctor to see if you might have low vitamin D, and if it is low, you‚Äôll def need to get more vitamin D, especially during the winter months.Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is vital to the function of white blood cells that help to fight infections, and overall immune system health. Vitamin C is also important for iron absorption, and being deficient in iron can make you more vulnerable to infections in general.The normal, recommended daily intake of vitamin C for adults from the diet and/or supplements is 75 to 120 mg. You can get about 80 to 90 mg from a cup of orange juice or sliced orange, or even more from kiwi fruit, or a cup of sweet peppers.Zinc has become one of the most popular suggestions for reducing symptoms of coronavirus.Some studies showed that zinc reduces the duration of a cold by half, while others showed no effect. Another study found that the type of zinc taken determined the result‚Äîzinc gluconate lozenges that provided 13.3 milligrams (mg) of zinc lessened the duration of colds, but zinc acetate lozenges that provided 5 mg or 11.5 mg of zinc did not.Note: Please watch the whole video to get the proper details, for the character limitation of the youtube description, I couldn't provide the whole details, so I suggest you watch the whole video.Dr. Mike Hansen, MDInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care MedicineWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/Please subscribe to my channel and press the bell icon: https://www.youtube.com/c/DoctorMikeH...#coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19;PT12M41S;09/03/2020;09/03/2020;1412;Least Biased;Doctor Mike Hansen;/channel/UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A;UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A;20;UAHhhweamIU;"Mike Hansen, MD, is a medical doctor who is an internist, an intensivist, and a pulmonologist.

Building mostly with hand tools, Shawn James harvests building materials from the forests north of Toronto, Canada and crafts them into functional tools and shelters using traditional woodworking tools and methods. He practices bushcraft and survival skills every day, including fire starting, tree identification and harvesting, wild edible foraging, fishing, hunting, camping in the summer and winter, travelling by canoe and snowshoe, navigation and water collection and purification. Continue watching in 2019 as Shawn finishes the sauna, plants a forest garden for fruit and vegetables, builds an underground root cellar, ice house and cheese cave, a timber frame workshop and a remote hunt camp closer to fish and game.Music‚ÄúHome‚Äù, by Simon-Alexander https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9T...Thanks for watching!

Dr. Seheult explains the theory that seems most plausible to us here at MedCram.com: That COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the endothelium (the single layer of cells that line blood and lymphatic vessels).  This hypothesis helps explain the increase in cardiovascular complications from COVID-19: strokes, myocardial infarctions, thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism, DVTs, and other blood clots), as well as many critical patients who do not appear to have classic ARDS symptoms (and have relatively normal lung compliance etc. as observed by the research of Dr. Gattinoni in Italy and others).  A deep understanding of this theory requires a review of some foundational biochemistry including the electron transport chain and ATP - the energy currency of the body.Links referenced in this video:Johns Hopkins - https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.htmlWorldometer - https://www.worldometers.info/coronav...CDC and Lag Time - https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/...American Journal of Physiology - https://journals.physiology.org/doi/f...Some previous videos from this series (visit MedCram.com for the full series):- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 62: Treatment with Famotidine (Pepcid)? https://youtu.be/DtPwfihjyrY- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 61: Blood Clots & Strokes in COVID-19; ACE-2 Receptor; Oxidative Stress https://youtu.be/22Bn8jsGI54- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 60: Hydroxychloroquine Update; NYC Data; How Widespread is COVID-19? https://youtu.be/fn2yk5SbGiw- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 59: Dr. Seheult's Daily Regimen (Vitamin D, C, Zinc, Quercetin, NAC) https://youtu.be/NM2A2xNLWR4- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 58: Testing; Causes of Hypoxemia in COVID-19 (V/Q vs Shunt vs Diffusion) https://youtu.be/nO4xgcIaPeA- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 57: Remdesivir Treatment Update and Can Far-UVC Disinfect Public Spaces? https://youtu.be/2U4DAQ3kjRs- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 56: What is ‚ÄúForest Bathing‚Äù & Can It Boost Immunity Against Viruses? https://youtu.be/PgDjVEpEOdQ- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 55: How COVID-19 Infection Attacks The Immune System & Differs From HIV: https://youtu.be/8NffZAGELGg- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 54: COVID-19 Antibody vs. PCR Testing; When to Relax Social Distancing?: https://youtu.be/kgzFAdYwYLM- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 53: Anticoagulation; Can Mechanical Ventilation Make COVID 19 Worse?: https://youtu.be/o8aG63yigjA- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 52: Ivermectin Treatment; Does COVID-19 Attack Hemoglobin?: https://youtu.be/qc6VV7ue4cE- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 51: State by State Projections; Ultrasound to Diagnose COVID19 Pneumonia: https://youtu.be/E7MufS6dnJw- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 50: Dip in Daily New Deaths; Research on Natural Killer Cells & COVID-19: https://youtu.be/fya6Zwxch88- Coronavirus Pandemic Update 49: New Data on COVID-19 vs Other Viral Infections (Ventilator Outcomes): https://youtu.be/uaIzj3s3p4A - Coronavirus Pandemic Update 48: Curve Flattening in California, PPE in the ICU, Medication Trials: https://youtu.be/JN-8bGB1cLM- How Coronavirus Kills: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) & Treatment: https://youtu.be/okg7uq_HrhQMany other videos on COVID-19 (coronavirus outbreak, coronavirus symptoms, influenza, coronavirus epidemic, corona virus updates, coronavirus vaccine, boosting the immune system, vitamin D, vitamin C, Zinc, Quercetin, NAC, n-acetyl cysteine, Insomnia, PPE, hydroxychloroquine, ultrasound to diagnose COVID-19, coronavirus New York, COVID-19 and the epithelium/blood vessels) and other medical topics (ECG Interpretation, strokes, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, hypercoagulation, hypertension, anticoagulation, DKA, acute kidney injury, influenza, measles, mechanical ventilation, etc.) at MedCam.comSpeaker: Roger Seheult, MDBoard Certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Disease, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine.MedCram provides videos to a variety of medical schools, education programs, and institutions (please contact us at customers@medcram.com if you are interested)Media Contact: customers@medcram.comMedia contact info: https://www.medcram.com/pages/media-c...MedCram medical videos are for medical education and exam preparation, and NOT intended to replace recommendations from your doctor.#COVID19 #SARSCoV2 #Coronavirus";PT26M28S;29/04/2020;29/04/2020;3512;Least Biased;MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY;/channel/UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ;UCG-iSMVtWbbwDDXgXXypARQ;20;Aj2vB_VITXQ;"Clinicians and students deserve better medical education!

Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.For thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.Mr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSB‚Äôs College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.Through Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.His artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

This video also specifically looks at the controversy with Donald Trump, including how some public figures and professional have attempted to diagnose him with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and other mental disorders. Ethical principles disallow the diagnosing of public figures, however, some clinicians have claimed that their duty to warn supersedes the ethical prohibitions (including the Goldwater Rule). Dr. Bandy Lee (The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump) and George Conway (Tweets about NPD and APD) have both weighed in on the discussion and their positions are analyzed here.Diagnostic criteria for NPD:grandiosity, fantasies of success, special or unique, requiring excessive admiration, sense of entitlement, manipulation, lack of empathy, envy, arroganceDiagnostic criteria for APD - violating society's norms, lying, impulsivity, irritability or aggression, disregarding safety, being irresponsible, lack of remorsehttps://www.nbcc.org/Ethics/CodeOfEthicshttps://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/...;PT22M51S;21/03/2019;21/03/2019;2233;Left-Center;Dr. Todd Grande;/channel/UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;19;oesJxfP85H0;"Dr. Todd L.

As a physical therapist these are common complaints I treat in my clinic - oftentimes these issues correlate directly with a person's posture. Today I'm sharing 5 of my favorite exercises you can do at home to help correct these postural issues.Here's an Amazon link to my favorite foam roller: https://amzn.to/2PTB2SDDAILY STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINE AT HOME: https://youtu.be/xb0vui7Ny8A6-MINUTE POSTURE CORRECTION WITH A FOAM ROLLER: https://youtu.be/8otTdS5DhE4HOW TO ELIMINATE MUSCLE KNOTS IN YOUR NECK, SHOULDERS, AND BACK: https://youtu.be/9PC9Mn0VO00BEST EXERCISES FOR UPPER BACK PAINhttps://youtu.be/cGjZ_XAvaXISETUP YOUR DESK TO IMPROVE YOUR POSTURE AND ELIMINATE NECK/SHOULDER PAIN:https://youtu.be/x12GnuV9QgwAs a physical therapist, I treat many posture related problems.The thing is ‚Äì people don‚Äôt come in to my clinic complaining of ‚Äúbad posture‚Äú. People come into my clinic complaining of the symptoms that are typically associated with bad posture. Neck pain, knots in your upper shoulders, headache pain, etc. are typically related to poor posture.These are the complaints for which people typically seek Physical Therapy help; little do these patients know how many of them wouldn‚Äôt be in any pain if they just spent some time addressing their posture!Today on Tone and Tighten I wanted to discuss these postural issues ‚Äì specifically what is poor posture, why you developed it, and some simple exercises you can do to correct this problem.What is it?Poor posture is typically characterized by what we refer to as a ‚Äúforward head and rounded shoulders‚Äú posture. When you stand up straight and tall, if I were to look at your profile from the side your ear should be directly located over the tip of your shoulder. Your sternum/chest should be pointed up with your shoulder blades sent back. This is what ‚Äúgood‚Äú posture looks like.In this position, gravity holds your head squarely on top your neck with very minimal muscle activation required. This results in minimal tension, decreased muscle knots, and decreased muscle activation.Now let‚Äôs take a look at the implications of bad posture‚Ä¶Again, bad posture is typically characterized by a ‚Äúforward head and rounded shoulders‚Äú. Forward head refers to the position of your head relative to your shoulders. It simply means that if I were to look at your standing posture from the profile view your ear would be out in front of the tip of your shoulder.This typically causes a ‚Äúrounding‚Äú forward of the shoulder blades and an increased visible ‚Äúhump‚Äú in the upper back.In this position, your head is not in an ideal anatomical location. Gravity would cause it to flop forward if not for some muscle activation to hold it up. So to prevent your head from flopping forward you must activate the muscles in your neck and upper shoulders.15‚Äì30 minutes at a time this might be OK, but when you spend 8 ‚Äì 12 ‚Äì 16 hours in this position, those muscles can get extremely fatigued.The result is increased tension in your neck, pain with movement, stiffness, knots in your upper shoulders, and even headaches.So what do we do about it?The muscles in your body are highly adaptable to stresses placed on them or removed from them.Our forward head and rounded shoulders posture typically results in what we refer to as an ‚Äúupper cross syndrome‚Äú. The muscles through the front of your chest and back of your neck get tight while the muscles through your upper back and front of your neck get stretched out and week.The treatment for this poor posture issue is to basically reverse our ‚Äúupper cross syndrome‚Äú. We need to stretch where it‚Äôs tight (upper chest, front of the shoulders, and neck) and strengthen where it‚Äôs weak (rhomboids and middle traps ‚Äì between your shoulder blades).Here are 5 of my favorite exercises to help you overcome these problems. Push ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù on the video above for a detailed description of the principles discussed in this post including an explanation of the following exercises.Remember ‚Äì oftentimes you don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúpoor posture‚Äù‚Ä¶ but you certainly feel the effects from it. If you carry a large amount of tension in your neck and shoulders, get neck pain regularly, or experience tension headaches ‚Äì your posture certainly could be playing a role in that.Performing these exercises regularly will help to improve your posture. In fact many of my patients notice a significant improvement in about a month; it might be up to 3 months to see a remarkable improvement (it took your body a long time to develop poor posture; it‚Äôs going to take some time and effort to reverse this problem). You have to be diligent and consistent, but I know these can help you out!";PT13M33S;12/04/2018;12/04/2018;6551;;Tone and Tighten;/channel/UCJASBOyF4Fkd26SIwRhLuZw;UCJASBOyF4Fkd26SIwRhLuZw;19;5R54QoUbbow;Hi - I'm Jared!

Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin‚Äôs theory in their two books and essay, respectively¬†The Deniable Darwin,¬†Darwin‚Äôs Doubt, and ‚ÄúGiving Up Darwin‚Äù (published in the¬†Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term ‚Äúspecies‚Äù has not been defined by the authors to Darwin‚Äôs disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin‚Äôs theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): ‚ÄúBeauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe‚Äîwalking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track‚Äîmost of the time.‚Äù Gelernter notes that there‚Äôs no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture‚Äînot the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin‚Äôs book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

I also payed $20 for this one. Since then it was laying aroung in my basement. I always knew that I'll restore this one as well, just because it's a Gressel and it will totally worth to safe it from the trash.This one wasn't that rusty like the other one, but it was also completely deadlocked. The handle was beaten up and bent. The jaws, some screws and two pieces to hold the spindle were missing. The pin that secures the spindle from turning was broken. Because of all that the spindle fell out. This vise has two threads and two concentric bushings to keep the jaws in place. Talking to Gressel I found out that this method was only produced until 1960, so it's at least 60 years old now. It could be from 1943, as both parts had a ‚Äû43‚Äú stamped on them. As these original jaws are getting no longer produced, I decided to drill an extra hole between the threads to be able to use new jaws. Gressel was so nice to send me new flat jaws. All the bare surfaces were in really bad condition due to heavy use, that's why I decided to weld up material and clean all these surfaces on the milling machine. I replaced the handle with a new one, but I used the old rounded ends again which turned out great. I later secured the ends with Loctite when reassembling. I also made the two missing screws and the broken pin out of the old handle. I choose to paint the whole vise the same color as the movable jaws from the new Gressel vises are, cobalt blue (RAL5013). I think it turned out very well, the white lettering, the shiny bare spots and the black parts match very well.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon and PayPal supporters and specially to:Adel AlSaffarafreeflyingsoulDavid BarkerGregoryMuzaffer AksoyVince ValentiYale BakerAlan Hansonalex latzkoAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndreswara HermawanAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerCourtney MaleportCristian ZorillaDan WilliamsDre GilleyHarper KimHunter R.JD SmithJessica AlexanderJoel MillerJonas RichartzLVEMarc CercierMartin R√∏nnow KlarlundMauricio PachecoMellissa MarcusMellissa McConnellNick CannonPaul AmbryPaul MampillyRisky DeemRobert EverichShikidixiTrevor KamTRG RestorationÏõÖÎ°ù Ïú§Timestamps:00:00 preview00:44 disassembling02:45 showing all the parts02:53 cleaning the parts with the parts washer03:11 removing the old bushings04:24 sandblasting05:17 restoring the fix jaw07:57 restoring the movable jaw09:45 restoring the ends of the handle10:37 making a new handle on the lathe11:48 restoring the spindle nut13:15 restoring the spindle nut holder plate14:05 making two new screws for the plate on the lathe and milling machine15:27 restoring the spindle16:21 making a new pin for the spindle on the lathe17:04 making the missing parts for the spindle on the lathe and milling machine18:12 applying filler18:52 painting19:41 showing the new jaws19:54 showing the new hardened pins19:57 showing all parts before reassembling20:09 reassembling22:26 showing the finished restoration23:22 final test23:49 Patreon supportersTime and costs of this restoration:I was working on this project for 2 weeks$20 vise$20 2k primer$30 2k coat cobalt blue (RAL5013)$30 steel for new partsMy camera:Panasonic HC-V180If you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

Hermann L√ºdeking, Jozef Sowa and Alodia Witaszek have never met, but they shared the same fate.Tears still come to Jozef Sowa‚Äôs eyes when he talks about his life. His parents were murdered by Wehrmacht soldiers in Poland in 1943, and he and his four siblings were taken to Germany. Four of them managed to return to Poland. But his younger sister Janina was given up for adoption - as a supposedly German child. She still lives in Germany today. This kidnapping was planned. In 1941, Himmler, who headed the Nazi SS, gave the order to ""gather young children who are especially racially suitable from Polish families and for us to raise them in special modestly-sized kindergartens and children‚Äôs homes.""Professor Isabel Heinemann explains, ""By so doing, he aimed to build up the German race."" For years, the historian has been researching the fates of the estimated 50 thousand children in Europe who were snatched. The largest group comes from Poland. Without their biological parents to protect them, the children were given to German families by the ""SS Race and Resettlement Main Office."" Their names and dates of birth were changed to obscure their true identity.After the war ended, those whose origins could be traced returned to their homelands. But their native countries had often become foreign to them and being singled out as a German ""Hitler child"" made reintegration difficult. Those responsible for the kidnapping were never brought to justice.Spanish and Arabic will be available online in April.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

So I decided to do a video so  I could contain all that annoyance (rage?  am I being dramatic?) someplace outside of myself.  This way I can go on with my life without rehashing imaginary arguments in the shower every day üòÇHere's a list I'm keeping of some of the most annoying objections to the Enneagram, and some lines of thinking I think help bring them around:HERE'S AN OBJECTION I'VE HEARD: The Enneagram is completely based on self-assessment!! üò†Isn't self-assessment a good thing to do?=============ANOTHER BIG ONE IS: The 9 Types are not real or accurate!  üò†The traditional concepts of ‚Äúmind‚Äù, ‚Äúemotions‚Äù, and ‚Äúbody‚Äù are also not real or accurate. However, they are very helpful!===============OBJECTION: The Enneagram gives people an excuse for their bad decisions! üò†The Enneagram doesn‚Äôt give anybody a blank check to do anything.  There isn‚Äôt even one official way to do the Enneagram. Some  people use the enneagram to get clarity. Others use it to get mystery. Others use it to gain intimacy.==============OBJECTION: The enneagram is too arbitrary. Why are there 9 types instead of 3 or 10?! üò†I did a video about the Triads which helps explain why there are exactly 9 types, and how they are derived.  https://bit.ly/2PzM0Nk==============OBJECTION: The enneagram is not ‚Äùbiblical‚Äù! üò† 1 John says that ‚Äúperfect love drives out fear.‚Äù The Enneagram agrees with this, and asks us to plunge in one step deeper: what kinds of fear, and does everybody have the same fears?============OBJECTION: We are all supposed to be looking more like Christ, so why would I care about my individual distinctions? üò†Jesus‚Äôs own personality contains complex positive values that are often contradictory (for example, he is gentle, but he can also be fierce.). Which complex nuances of Christ do you exhibit?==============OBJECTION: At least MBTI was developed by a psychologist‚Ä¶ üò†MBTI is about behavior & performance.   Enneagram is about motivations.   Motivations are ineffable, but somehow they are valuable to study.==============OBJECTION: Due to the Barnum Effect, people can be tricked into believing they are any of the 9 Types! üò†If someone mistypes as the wrong type but still walks away with awareness about a latent fear they have and the consequences it has on others, I would still classify that as a win!;PT4M0S;11/12/2019;11/12/2019;1032;;RockBridgeIsland;/channel/UCclbeGw9IqdJoTwsKV3kEbA;UCclbeGw9IqdJoTwsKV3kEbA;20;hNxARamiBPs;"A lot of people call me CDT, but you can also call me Christopher :).

We see all these examples in the media like Katherine Murray, Stephanie Ragusa, Pamela Rogers, and probably among the most famous would be Deborah LaFave and Mary Kay Letourneau.

I've been gardening for 30 years, 10 of which I was mentored by a University of California Certified Master Gardener.  

I don‚Äôt just love gardening, it is my passion and other than my family and friends, it is my life.  I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. 

Now, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.  
I only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.

Nothing more, nothing less. If you understand that, and you understand how memories are formed, then you can make progress in a way you've never dreamed possible before. Gabriel Wyner is an author, opera singer and polyglot based in Chicago. After reaching fluency in German in 14 weeks with the help of the immersive Middlebury Language Schools, he fell in love with the process of language learning, going on to spend two months in intensive Italian courses in Perugia, Italy. Searching for ways to bring the immersion experience into the home, he began to develop a system that rapidly builds fluency in short, daily sessions. In 2010, his efforts paid off. He learned French to fluency in 5 months, and then Russian in 10 months. Born in Los Angeles, he graduated summa cum laude in 2007 from the University of Southern California with dual degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Vocal Arts Performance, and was awarded the Renaissance Scholar‚Äôs prize for excellence in unrelated disciplines. He then moved to Vienna to pursue triple Master‚Äôs degrees at the Konservatorium Wien in Opera, Lieder and Voice, and graduated with honors in 2011. Currently learning Japanese, he's learned Hungarian and Spanish over the last few years. His book on language learning ‚Äì Fluent Forever: How to learn any language fast and never forget it ‚Äì was published on August 5, 2014 (Harmony/Random House). His most recent project has been the development of a new language learning tool, which became the most successful Kickstarter for an app in history in September of 2017.

He won the WBC title in 1986 after stopping Trevor Berbick in two rounds, and added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating James Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987.

But there's a lot more to her than all that. Here's the story of her stunning transformation.Kunis was born on August 14, 1983 in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. She was the second child of Mark and Elvira Kunis. The family was Jewish, which made it difficult living there at the time. As Kunis explained to The Sun in 2012,""My whole family was in the Holocaust. My grandparents passed and not many survived. After the Holocaust, in Russia you were not allowed to be religious. So my parents raised me to know I was Jewish. You know who you are inside.""Kunis' parents both had good jobs. Mark was a mechanical engineer, and Elvira worked as a physics teacher. But the two decided to move to America to make a new life when Mila was seven years old. That road to a better life was a long and hard one, as the family had just $250 when they touched down in Los Angeles in 1991.While the Kunises had middle-class jobs in Ukraine, they struggled to make ends meet in their new home, with Mark doing odd jobs, and Elvria working in a drugstore. Mila also had trouble assimilating into American culture. She told the Los Angeles Times in 2008,""I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language.""

As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley‚Äôs Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a ‚Äúcertificate of friendship‚Äù from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He‚Äôs even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly‚Äôs granddaughter.Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations.

These carriages were often built to accommodate two passengers, though some styles did have a small jump seat to seat children also.  These were driven by a hired chauffeur driver, so these were most often owned by nobility or the more affluent.  Although these were of British design, many American companies incorporated these styles in their line-up of offerings.  Brewster & Co of New York, and C.P. Kimball of Chicago, IL were among the companies building their variations of the Brougham.My metal marking pencil  https://amzn.to/2Hu75oBMetal marking pencil refills https://amzn.to/3744EDP The Rasp I like to use https://amzn.to/2wclyTIThe Rebar Leathernan I use https://amzn.to/2vuvWpHThe silk scarf I wear   https://amzn.to/2wGqKQf Carriage Terminology: An Historical Dictionary https://amzn.to/2Hfoq4HThe Brewster Story - https://amzn.to/2wzrUNqPractical Carriage Building https://amzn.to/3cJALfRWheel making: Wooden Wheel Design https://amzn.to/2TIxfK8Carriage and Wagon Axles https://amzn.to/3aGDXavAn Interesting account of an early English Wheelwright Shop https://amzn.to/39sAICRThe Wheelwright Shop, in Kindle form https://amzn.to/3bxYOhd;PT27M18S;24/04/2020;24/04/2020;3235;Least Biased;EngelsCoachShop;/channel/UCMgTlht-PsNniRIuaax4m8Q;UCMgTlht-PsNniRIuaax4m8Q;19;0vFJFyxcmbA;"Welcome to the world's largest video library dedicated to preserving the wheelwright and wainwright trade.

The YouTube star and former NASA engineer describes how this data-backed mindset for life gamification has stuck with him along his journey, and how it impacts the ways he helps (or tricks) his viewers into learning science, engineering, and design. Mark Rober has made a career out of engineering, entertainment, and education. After completing degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California, Rober joined NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2004. In his nine years as a NASA engineer, seven of which were on the Mars rover Curiosity team, Rober worked on both the Descent Stage (the jet pack that lowered the Rover to the surface) and some hardware on the Rover top deck for collecting samples. In 2011, Rober‚Äôs iPad-based Halloween costume helped launch both his creative costume company, Digital Dudz, and his YouTube channel, which now boasts 3 million subscribers and 400 million views. His videos focus on creative ideas and science- and engineering-based pranks and activities. Rober is a regular guest on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"". Today, he does research and development work for a large technology company in Northern California, where he lives with his wife and son.

ABOUT

Wim Hof (""The Iceman"") is the creator of the Wim Hof Method. Through more than thirty years of training in nature, he has developed a method that combines specific breathing techniques, cold exposure and mindset. This method has been the first to scientifically prove the ability to actively influence the innate immune system and the autonomic nervous system.

Wim holds 26 world records, and has numerous other feats under his belt. He ran a marathon under the Polar Circle in nothing but shorts, holds the world record for sitting in ice ‚Äîat almost two hours‚Äî and has climbed Mt.

I didn't like wakin' up, I ain't have no purpose, I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing. On October 8, 1985, I walked in a comedy club for the first time, signed up for the following week. The following week, a girl took me down there, she said, ""You got to go to comedy club, you the funniest person I've ever met. I'd never even heard of comedy clubs. I'm 27. I walked into the comedy club, I sign up for the following week. I'm gonna sit here and learn. I knew I was funny, I just didn't know what to do with it. They had 10 acts go up. Nine of 'em went up, I didn't laugh at one joke. I was just sittin' there just, ""Man, I wished that was me. Man, they shoulda said this."" Every joke they told, I knew the punch line before they said it, and I wrote a better punch line in my mind, what they shoulda said. It got to guy number 10, they called his name, he wasn't there. They said, ""Well, he's not here, we gonna go to next week's list. Steve Harvey, where are you? Long story short, I won amateur night that night. I won $50. It was a 45-minute drive to my house with this girl named Gladys. I cried 45 minutes. She said, ""What you crying for? It ain't but $50."" I said, ""No, no, you don't even understand. I was born tonight. I now know what I'm supposed to do.‚Äú I went to work the next day, October 9th and quit my job. With $50. I had nothing. I just never gave up. I‚Äômma tell you something that decision cost me everything I had I lost everything I lost my family I lost friends I lost every day I became homeless I lived in a car for three years but I just saw this I saw this I saw this vision I just pursued it I said why I said you have to take chances in life. Life is about risk. If you play it safe in life you ain't gonna have much of a life. If you play it safe you won't have much of a life. Life is risk it takes it take courage to pursue your dreams. now it's gonna cost you something but most people are not willing to pay what it costs to go after your dream cuz you gonna have to hurt a little bit and most people don't like being uncomfortable if you don't want to be uncomfortable please do not pursue success because success is a very uncomfortable feeling and I just learned to be I learned to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Life is hard. See for every time you have a plan, a dream, an aspiration or a goal, do you know what happens every time you have one of those? This thing comes along called life. It happens to everybody. Life has disappointment it got peaks and valleys. You gonna lose somebody you care about one day. That‚Äôs a valley. Somebody gonna close the plan you thought was gonna stay open so you could retire. That‚Äôs a valley. Somebody gonna fire you for an unjust cause, that‚Äôs a valley. The people that got your credit card, gonna sell their company, gonna sell their business to another credit card company, your 18% go up to 26%, you don‚Äôt even know why now, your minimum didn‚Äôt change. Cause it‚Äôs life. You can stop thinking, that life finna be easy cause I got news for you, it ain‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a false hope, to think you‚Äôre gonna have a wonderfully carefree life. That‚Äôs unthinkable. We all live in this bubble. What you gotta do, you gotta put more air in your bubble. You got to blow your bubble up. Expand yourself. Take yourself out of your comfort zone. Do not live in your bubble. Put some more air in your bubble. If you stay in your comfort zone, that‚Äôs where you will fail. You will fail in your comfort zone. Success is not a comfortable procedure. It is a very uncomfortable thing to attempt. So you gotta get comfortable being uncomfortable if you ever wanna be successful. Start putting some pressure on. Put some pressure on yourself. Get out here and get about it. Look I‚Äôd love to sugar coat this thing for you, I‚Äôd love to tell you look ‚Äúyou can go out here and get rich, do a couple of things.‚Äù#steveharvey #steveharveystory #steveharvey2019 #steveharveytribute #successstory #steveharveymotivation #steveharveysuccess #ragstoriches #motivation #motivationalvideo #motivationalvideo2019";PT5M41S;27/06/2019;27/06/2019;10242;;The Outcome;/channel/UCI_2HqC2a22Q4Jx41o9g72w;UCI_2HqC2a22Q4Jx41o9g72w;19;Un-gNbNwwsQ;"""Once you KNOW something, you can't UNKNOW it.""

I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny.

Sometimes they can be your fault, other times they can be from normal wear and tear maintenance issues or manufacturers defects.  This shower was installed in 2006, using the CUSTOMER SUPPLIED waterproofing membrane with their accompanying linear drain. This drain, despite using the noble seal membrane, was NOT--  I repeat, NOT A NOBLE DRAIN!.  It appears to be an aftermarket product that used Noble membrane. It came with a pre-sloped foam base, the first of its kind as I recall.  In our area, we always used mud bases and hot mop or vinyl shower pans.  This method was completely new to me, and I told the homeowner that I had never seen a system like this or installed a system like this.  It is similar to the Schluter Kerdi system, which we are now all very familiar with.   The customer called me last month to ask me about some loose and cracking tiles in the shower floor and if there was any way to save the rest of the shower. I went out for an initial site visit and my first thought was that maybe the shower door guys had punctured the waterproofing membrane and that is what caused the shower to fail.  I broke a piece of the tile and dug down to the sub floor and found that the waterproofing had been compromised and the wood subfloor was wet.  This video is of the rescheduled a visit to remove as much of the floor as possible, to see the extent of the water damage, and to see if the rest of the bathroom was salvageable.  Since the homeowner had purchased the original waterproofing, and the shower was past the 10 year manufacturers warranty, he agreed to pay for whatever repairs needed to be done.  He wanted to use our company again because he was very pleased with the work we had done in this bathroom and the rest of his house as well.  Upon further inspection, the shower door was not the source of the water penetration.  The source was that the factory installed polyethylene flap that was bonded to the stainless steel drain body had completely de-laminated, allowing water to pour right into the wood subfloor below.  Unfortunately, the extent of the water damage didn't stop at the subfloor level, but rotted out several structural wood members including floor joists, girders, and wall studs.  This bathroom and the adjacent walls will need to be completely removed and replaced.  In this rare instance, it was a manufacturing defect that caused major damage that will cost several thousand dollars to repair.

Can you change their minds?TEACHERS: Get your students in the discussion on KQED Learn, a safe place for middle and high school students to investigate controversial topics and share their voices. https://learn.kqed.org/topics/8The Earth is flat. We never landed on the moon. Tupac is alive and well, living in Cuba and still releasing music to this day. Conspiracy theories are all over the internet. Why do some people believe in conspiracy theories, and can you change the mind of someone who believes in one?ABOVE THE NOISE is a show that cuts through the hype and investigates the research behind controversial and trending topics in the news. Hosted by Myles Bess.*NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY*SUBSCRIBE by clicking the RED BUTTON above.Follow us on Instagram @kqedabovethenoiseConspiracy theories are nothing new, but with the internet and the rise of social media, conspiracy theories are getting in front of a lot of eyeballs. After the Sandy Hook school shooting in late 2012, a term that started on underground blogs went mainstream -- CRISIS ACTORS. Conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones started pushing a narrative that the school shooting never happened, and that that the victims weren‚Äôt students but instead were paid actors.Sometimes, conspiracy theories can spill out into the real world and do actual damage -- like when a man armed with a rifle entered a Washington DC-area pizzeria, convinced that the restaurant was involved in a sex trafficking operation masterminded by Hillary Clinton. He didn‚Äôt find anything but a bunch of now-freaked-out people eating pizza.But have you ever sat down and tried to argue with someone who believes in a conspiracy theory? Can you change a conspiracy theorist‚Äôs mind? What is a conspiracy theory?A conspiracy theory is a belief that an organization is working in secret to achieve some sinister goal.Are conspiracy theories always false?Not always. They usually are false, but they can be true. For example, back in the 1950‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs, there was a conspiracy theory claiming that the CIA was using U.S. citizens to conduct secret mind control experiments. Surprisingly, that theory turned out to be true. The project was called MK Ultra, and it was indeed an experiment run by the CIA. Congressional testimony in the late 1970‚Äôs showed that it was real and did, in fact, happen.What is illusory pattern perception?Illusory pattern perception is when your brain perceives a pattern when one doesn‚Äôt actually exist.

Over 50 million car tires are sold each year in Germany alone. But where does the natural rubber for them come from?The biggest producer of natural rubber for tires is Thailand. More than four million tonnes of rubber are harvested annually in plantations there. And demand for rubber is ever growing - because ever more tires are needed. But the labor conditions in Southeast Asia are harsh - with working days of up to 12 hours and very low wages. In addition, toxic herbicides banned in Europe are used to fight weeds on the plantations. After the harvest, the ‚Äòwhite gold‚Äô rubber is sold to brokers, who, in turn, sell it on. German tire manufacturers, like Continental, for example, are keen to stress that they use ""natural commodities conscientiously.‚Äù But many car drivers don‚Äôt give a second thought about where the rubber in their tires comes from - and why we don‚Äôt recycle used tires more effectively. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It is an interesting case because it involves parricide, which is a rare type of homicide where children kill their parents. It's also interesting because it weaves the mental health components with ethics and confidentiality into the law.Facts of the Case:This case goes back to 1989, when two brothers Lyle Menendez (21 at the time) and Eric Menendez (18 at the time) lived in a Beverly Hills mansion with their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez. On August 18, 1989, the brothers bought two shotguns from a sporting goods store in San Diego. Two days later, Sunday night August 20, 1989 the crime took place. Jose was seated on a couch in the family room sleeping and Kitty was laying down with her head on his lap. One of the brothers aimed the 12-gauge shotgun at Jose, fired the shotgun, and struck him in the left elbow and the right arm. The other brother walked up behind Jose and shot him in the back of the head. Because of the shooting, Kitty woke up and she tried to flee, but she was injured by shots fired by the brothers. She was not killed at that time, so the brothers went out to their car because they ran out of ammunition before they could kill their mother. They reloaded the shotguns with birdshot came back in and shot her in the head several times. After Lyle and Erik killed their parents, they shot both Jose and Kitty each in the knee. They called the police and made an effort to cover up their crimes.In 1996, a jury returned a guilty verdict and the brothers both received two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.Mulvey, A., Fournier, A., & Donahue, T.

But when it comes to human behaviour, discrimination has reigned supreme in this pandemic. Around the world, various groups have been maligned and accused of spreading the virus. The coronavirus pandemic has even led to racist attacks against various minorities around the world. From Asians in Europe to Muslims in India and black people in the United States - fear over the pandemic is giving a boost to xenophobia and exclusion. Some say incendiary rhetoric from leaders is to blame for the behavior.

Ginger is so easy to sprout, given the right conditions. The rhizomes of this plant are not only tasty and necessary in numerous recipes, but they can also be sprouted to grow entirely new Ginger plants, for free! In this video, I show you exactly how to grow your own Ginger plants simply from store bought Ginger bulbs. This is a great project for growing indoors and for teaching kids how things grow, as well as the vegetative life cycles of root and shoot development. One of the best indoor projects that you gardeners can do as we wait for our garden beds and plots to thaw outside. As a fully tropical plant, Ginger needs supplemental heat if you live in temperate regions or if your indoor temperatures are below 80F. Sprouting usually takes place within a week with viable bulbs, although the progress of growth at this stage can vary quite a bit. Give it a try, starting, sprouting, and growing Ginger indoors is highly rewarding, and most of all, super fun!Check out the sequel video where we take that sprouted ginger and get it into our spring garden!:  https://youtu.be/WFgPGWgYw84If you're just starting out gardening in 2020, this inexpensive set of tools from Amazon can get you and your Ginger up and running this spring!

Dr. Jordan B Peterson is a professor and clinical psychologist. The videos are derived from two sources: 
1.

Much of that is down to early response, close monitoring and extensive use of modern science and technology. And not to be overlooked: the citizens willingness to adhere to government-imposed regulations.Reporters in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan look into how these countries have weathered the crisis and largely contain the coronavirus. In South Korea, rigorous testing and state-of-the-art technology have been key in keeping the number of infections and deaths low. In Taiwan, access to masks and a sense of solidarity help to hold the virus at bay. In Japan, discipline and strict hygiene measures have allowed public life to continue without too much interruption, even in densely populated Tokyo. And in China, where the coronavirus pandemic started, quarantines, lock-down and strict surveillance have contributed to slowing spread. Whether or not these methods prove sustainable in the long run remains to be seen. But they are sending a message of hope that there may be ways out of the coronavirus crisis.-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Instead of hapless resolutions members of the ""Lock-In"" cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences).

This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim‚Äôs treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator‚Äôs men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)¬†and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)¬†caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. ¬†Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.¬†It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO). Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the treatment, prognosis, and precautions for COVID-19 (current as of 3/15/2020).

And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.Editor's note:From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself‚Äîin 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts‚Äô opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.Some of our viewers felt the documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.#ccpvirus #wuhan #coronavirus- - - - - - - - -Sign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party‚ñ∂Ô∏èhttps://ccpvirustruth.com- - - - - - - - -Subscribe for updates: http://bit.ly/CrossroadsYTMake a donation:  https://donorbox.org/crossroads-joshu...https://twitter.com/crossroads_joshFollow us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrossroadsET- - - - - - - - -Hosted by @JoshJPhilipphttps://twitter.com/JoshJPhilippSUBSCRIBE TO THE EPOCH TIMESPrint subscription (delivery inside the U.S only):https://theepochtimes.f2vr2q.net/q9BobProduced by @EpochTimeshttps://twitter.com/EpochTimes- - - - - - - - -WATCH MORE ON YOUTUBEüîµ Escape from Wuhan: 55,000 People Flee; Second Wave Of Outbreaks? | CCP virus | Crossroads https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDI9e...üîµ Ending lockdowns in Wuhan?

Dr. Rosenthal is a virologist and an immunology professor. Dr. Rosenthal answers several questions related to the novel coronarvirus:1. Can you discuss the process of developing a vaccine? How long will it take? Does the process take a certain amount of time no matter how many people are working on the development? Is the development linear or trial and error?2. Do ethical considerations slow the process down?3. Would development accelerate if more financial resources were committed?4. Once a vaccine has been developed, is it easy to produce substantial quantities of it?5. Is developing a cure possible? Is the process similar to one used to find a vaccine?6. What is the mechanism of death with Covid 19?7. Why are some people asymptomatic while others die from the infection?8. Will this virus become seasonal (like influenza)?9. Without a vaccine, it is realistic to believe they can safely socialize with the population or do they need to stay isolated?10. Can social distancing contain the virus or are we simply delaying the inevitable11. What percentage of the population needs to be immune to realize ‚Äúherd immunity?‚Äù12. Do viruses ever serve a positive function or are the universally destructive? Dr. Rosenthal‚Äôs book: http://www.aimspress.com/article/10.3...MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY, 9th EDITION, (2021).

What danger lies in wait for average citizens? For years, the world‚Äôs central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it‚Äôs not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: ""This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it‚Äôs not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It‚Äôs a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates._______Exciting, powerful and informative ‚Äì DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world‚Äôs last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative ‚Äì DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Casey Anthony was charged with killing her two-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. This crime allegedly took place in 2008. I'll be taking a look at a lot of different factors in this case including potential mental health and personality factors, but just to be clear I'm not diagnosing Casey Anthony or anyone else involved in this case. In 2008, Casey Anthony was 18 years old and Caylee Anthony her daughter was 2 years old. They lived with Casey's parents, Cindy and George Anthony. From an outside observer‚Äôs point of view, this case started on July 15, 2008, when Cindy Anthony called the police and reported that her granddaughter was missing for 31 days. The next day charges of making a false statement to law enforcement were filed against Casey as she lied during the investigation. in October of 2015, she would be charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child. In December, in a wooded area near their house, Caylee's body was discovered. The trial which started in 2011. There were really two theories of the crime that kind of emerged. On the state side their theory was that Casey bought chloroform used it on Caylee and then suffocated her and on the defense side they said that it was an accidental drowning.  The prosecution rested on June 15, 2011 and 15 days later the defense rested. The jury found that Casey Anthony was not guilty of any of the homicide or homicide related charges, but rather providing false information to a law enforcement officer. So she was convicted of four counts of lying to law enforcement and sentenced to one year per count, but when taking into account how long she'd already been in jail and the good behavior time she'd earned, she was released shortly after the verdict.https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/29/us/cas...https://www.scribd.com/doc/78214790/c...https://www.scribd.com/doc/78214603/c...https://www.apnews.com/c36cea8e48364e...;PT24M42S;02/04/2019;02/04/2019;242;Left-Center;Dr. Todd Grande;/channel/UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;19;IDm4KDZVmoI;"Dr. Todd L.

America's Worst...Israel Keyes;Entertainment;1192869;5.031;1.007;"Documentary that I filmed with the BBC, currently available on Netflix. Don't miss what we're up to next, Please SUBSCRIBE to  to keep up! Responsible for murders in New York, Vermont, Rhode Island, Alaska, Alabama, and possibly more. Dan Oshier Productions - The ""Almost"" final cut of the documentary I did camera and editing work on for The UK's Firstlooktv. (THIS IS A LOW-RESOLUTION COPY, SORRY LEGAL STUFF) Filming on location in Tupper Lake, New York and throughout Vermont. Aerial Video, Camera/ Production Assistant, and video editing.Israel Keyes was an American serial killer, rapist, arsonist, burglar and bank robber. Keyes admitted to violent crimes as early as 1996, with the violent sexual assault of a teenage girl in Oregon. He committed a long series of rapes and murders until his capture in 2012. He was being held in custody, awaiting trial for the murder of Samantha Koenig, when he committed suicide in prison.VictimsKeyes admitted to investigators that he killed four people in Washington, claims which are the subject of an active investigation by the state police and FBI. Keyes did not have a felony criminal record in Washington, although he had been cited in Thurston County for driving without a valid license and, in an earlier incident, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence. Authorities are reviewing unsolved murder and missing persons cases to determine which cases, if any, may link to Keyes.Keyes confessed to at least one murder in New York State. Authorities have not determined the identity, age, or sex of the victim, or when and where the murder may have occurred, but regard the confession as credible. Keyes had ties to New York; he owned ten acres and a run down cabin in the town of Constable. Keyes also confessed to committing bank robberies in New York and Texas. The FBI later confirmed that Keyes robbed the Community Bank branch in Tupper Lake, New York, in April 2009, leaving no casualties. He also told authorities that he burglarized a Texas home and set it on fire.In April 2009, Keyes claimed to have killed a woman in New Jersey and buried her near Tupper Lake in upstate New York. Keyes was also linked to the deaths of Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont. Keyes reportedly broke into the Curriers' home on the night of June 8 and tied them up before driving to an abandoned farmhouse, where he shot Bill before sexually assaulting and strangling Lorraine. However, their bodies have not been found. Two years prior to the Curriers' deaths, Keyes hid a ""murder kit"" near their home which he later used to kill them. After the murders, he moved most of the items to a new hiding place in Parishville, New York, where they remained until after his arrest.Keyes' last known murder was the kidnapping and killing of 18-year-old Samantha Koenig, a barista working in Anchorage, Alaska. Authorities said that Keyes kidnapped her from her place of employment on February 1, 2012, stole her debit card and other property, then murdered her the following day. Police stated that Keyes sexually assaulted Koenig before he murdered her. After Koenig's death, Keyes left on a cruise out of New Orleans, leaving Koenig's body in a shed. When he returned home, he took a photograph of her body with a four-day-old issue of the Anchorage Daily News, maintaining the illusion that she was still alive in his ransom demand. After demanding $30,000 in ransom, Keyes dismembered Koenig and disposed of her body in Matanuska Lake north of Anchorage.Modus operandiKeyes planned murders long ahead of time and took extraordinary action to avoid detection. Unlike most serial killers, he did not have a victim profile. He usually killed far from home, and never in the same area twice. On his murder trips, he kept his mobile phone turned off and paid for items with cash. He had no connection to any of his victims. In the Currier murders, he flew to Chicago, and there rented a car to drive the 1000 additional miles to Vermont. He then used the murder kit he had hidden two years earlier to perform the murders.Keyes admired Ted Bundy and shared several similarities with him: Both were methodical and felt a possession over their victims. However, there are notable differences. Bundy's murders were spread throughout the country, mainly because he lived in many different areas, and not as an intentional effort to avoid detection as was the case with Keyes. Bundy targeted only attractive young women, usually with hair parted down the middle, while Keyes had no particular type of victim.Zodiak Media FirstLooktv in the UK.Thanks Will Hanrahan and crew!

Using this exercise, you can train the muscles of the mid and upper back to achieve and maintain better posture. This exercise can help you with your hunchback (kyphosis) and forward head posture.As with any exercise, this must be done regularly and consistently to get results that last. How long it takes will depend on how bad your posture is to start with and how much your daily habits put you in bad posture. In general, we recommend holding the position for 2.5 to 3.5 minutes and doing the exercise once or twice a day (more if your body responds well to it). If you spend a lot of time in a hunchback position or you find this exercise extremely difficult, you may need to do it more than someone who has less kyphosis. If someone has a good overall lifestyle that allows them to stay out of bad posture for longer periods, they may need to do this very little.;PT6M40S;20/09/2017;20/09/2017;9532;;Upright Health;/channel/UCCwj1xAY55Dd-H281T1g-bQ;UCCwj1xAY55Dd-H281T1g-bQ;19;GbGSvAEkE68;"We help you think right, move right, and feel right.

After decades of anguish, she decided to forgive the Nazis - and came to be one of the best-known and most-active Holocaust survivors in the world.At the age of 10, Eva Mozes Kor became a victim of Josef Mengele, the doctor at the Auschwitz concentration camp notorious for his barbaric experiments on twins. Eva and her twin sister Miriam lost both of their parents and two older sisters in the Holocaust; only Eva and Miriam survived. Eva later married an American and moved to the United States to begin a new life. In 1984, she founded the organization CANDLES together with the help of her sister Miriam. The name is an acronym for Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments Survivors. Working with the organization, Eva was able to locate 122 other survivors of Dr. Mengele‚Äôs horrific experiments around the world. In 1995, Eva also founded CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center to educate the public about eugenics, the Holocaust, and the power of forgiveness. That same year she publicly forgave the Nazis for what had been done to her - a decision that brought her international attention.Eva circled the globe delivering her message of peace, kindness, healing and self-empowerment for future generations. Her lessons went far beyond her own experience, addressing current global atrocities and two of the biggest problems facing today's youth: bullying and discrimination. Eva Mozes Kor died on 4 July 2019 in Krakow.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It boosts your ability to set healthy boundaries - no matter what others think of it; This is also a reflection of self-love and self-respect.

Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?This documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI‚Äôs capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI‚Äôs social implications?A documentary by Tilman Wolff und Ranga Yogeshwar --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In many ways, he is being treated as a terrorist. His health has suffered.

The U.S.A. is pressing charges for obtaining and disclosing classified information. Now, the extradition hearing is about to begin in London.

Learn why rainfall is an essential part of each flowering. And every small step ‚Äì part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art ‚ÄìKung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. ‚ÄúThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance‚Äù, says master Yi.  And as for flying ‚Äì yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020.

Around the same time I played bass on ""Pass Myself"", a highly collectable single by Neo-Psychedelic band the Third Eye, and several singles and albums for Danielle Dax.

I have toured and recorded with many British Blues Bands, notably Chad Strentz & The Chad-illacs, Shout Sister Shout, Breakout Blues and Mo'Indigo.

In reality, there are thousands of species of bats and a variety of eating habits.Vampire bats are actually the smallest group and only have three species that exist. Contrary to popular belief, vampire bats rarely if ever drink human blood. They typically feed on other sleeping mammals and birds.Vampire bats have evolved into having some rather unique abilities to aid them in finding prey. They have a sophisticated hearing ability, which allows them to distinguish how their prey is breathing. They can even determine if their prey is sleeping or awake, based on breathing patterns.Vampire bats even have the ability to detect infrared radiation to find the best spots to feed from animals and to detect them during complete darkness.Their saliva also has unique properties and it can work similarly to an anti-coagulant that keeps the blood from clotting, which makes it easier for them to feed. Vampire bats only drink about an ounce of blood in a sitting, which doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but for them, it could be up to one third of the bat‚Äôs body weight.Another food bats eat is fruitA much more common variety of bats are fruit bats with well over 100 different species on record. These bats have a wide range of shapes and sizes. Some fruit bats can be as small as a few ounces and others can be up to several pounds.Fruit bats also eat a variety of different kinds of fruits and some even feed from nectar in flowers. Depending on what kinds of fruit each species eat, they can have different adaptations to make feeding easier. Some fruit bats have teeth specially designed to chew through fruits with a tough rind and exterior, while others have longer tongues to feed on nectar deep inside flowers.Forget the knife and fork for dinner, as some fruit bats bring an extremely long tongue to the table. Each fruit bat species has differing lengths of tongues, but in some species, their tongue can be up to 150% the length of their body. For humans that would be like drinking a glass of water from anywhere from 7 to 9 feet away!Probably the best part of what bats eat are the bats that are insectivoresBats that eat insects actually like to eat one of the most annoying ones out there‚Ä¶Mosquitoes. A single little brown bat can eat up to 1000 mosquitoes an hour! Not a bad option for mosquito pest control if you don‚Äôt mind bats.Insectivore bats don‚Äôt just eat mosquitoes but other pests like beetles, moths, and more. Most bats in this category have exceptional hearing and can detect insects walking around on the ground and hear insects from far away.These are the most common bats you are going to find near your home. Bats of this type tend to live in trees, caves, under bridges, or in man made structures with low activity, such as sheds and barns. On rare occasions bats can make their way into your attic, home, or sometimes chimney.Bat removal is not something you should attempt to do on your own. It can be very dangerous without proper equipment and training. Some bats can also carry rabies in rare circumstances. Oddly enough, even though very few bats carry rabies, almost all cases that happen in humans come from bats.In most cases, bat exclusion isn‚Äôt done by capturing the bat and forcibly removing them, it‚Äôs done by letting them naturally leave your home or business and then sealing up the entry points before they return so they cannot get back in.If you are concerned with bats in your home or business contact a pest control company or wild life removal service that is properly trained to handle the safe removal of bats.Have a question for us?

I've been gardening for 30 years, 10 of which I was mentored by a University of California Certified Master Gardener.  

I don‚Äôt just love gardening, it is my passion and other than my family and friends, it is my life.  I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. 

Now, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.  
I only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.

Stick to the recipe rigidly, the quantities are very important for successful results2.  Use scales for the measurements including the water, don't convert to cups or measuring jugs, they are too inaccurate 3.  Use proper white bread flour with at least 12% protein, check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bag, protein may show in grams per serving but just work it out, it needs to be 12g of protein per 100g of flour, plain or all purpose flour is not strong enough for making bread. 4.  Check your yeast is working you can do a yeast test as shown in my sandwich bread video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSb... Any problems or inquiries I'm always here to help.

Is there any truth to such popular beliefs? The findings of researchers around the world say yes: It appears we really are what we eat.A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of L√ºbeck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called ""brain food"" for example: The Mediterranean diet that‚Äôs based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In that interview, Dr. Bhattacharya mentioned that he himself would soon be conducting tests for COVID-19 in Santa Clara County, California, one of the most active hotspots in the country. Today Dr. Bhattacharya returns to discuss the results of that study and one currently under way in partnership with Major League Baseball. We also discuss some signs of hope, and specifics about how the economy can be restarted safely and efficiently. Dr. Bhattacharya also gives some (unsolicited) advice to Dr. Anthony Fauci, California governor Gavin Newsom, and president Donald Trump.

She was convicted in 2015 of murdering a young man named Travis Alexander, who was somebody with whom she was in a relationship.I look at the timeline, but also the mental health and personality characteristics that may have been going on in this case. To be clear, I'm not diagnosing anybody, rather just speculating based on the evidence that's available. Jodi Arias was born in 1980 and Travis Alexander was born in 1977.  The murder occurred on June 4th 2008. In 2015, she was found guilty of first-degree murder and on sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. One of the reasons this was interesting, is this juxtaposition with post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder. There were different diagnoses from different clinicians. Whenever we see mental health and the law come together, this is a dangerous intersection.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual the DSM, which contains these mental disorders was written for treatment, it wasn't written to explain why people commit crimes.Symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationship pattern, identity disturbance, impulsivity and at least two areas that are potentially self damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, paranoid ideation or dissociationSymptom criteria for narcissistic personality disorder: grandiose sense of self-importance, fantasies about success wealth and power, believing oneself to be special or unique, requiring excessive admiration, a sense of entitlement, exploiting other people interpersonally, lack of empathy, jealousy, arrogance https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jodi-a...;PT23M37S;05/04/2019;05/04/2019;2421;Left-Center;Dr. Todd Grande;/channel/UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;20;0wKVy8z5rQs;"Dr. Todd L.

But more than 20 states are considering legislation similar to Nebraska's, and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both supported national right to repair legislation for farmers.When it comes to repair, farmers have always been self reliant. But the modernization of tractors and other farm equipment over the past few decades has left most farmers in the dust thanks to diagnostic software that large manufacturers hold a monopoly over.  In this episode of State of Repair, we go to Nebraska to talk to the farmers and mechanics who are fighting large manufacturers like John Deere for the right to access the diagnostic software they need to repair their tractors.This video was originally aired on Motherboard in 2018.Click here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICEAbout VICE:The Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

US troops who fought in the H√ºrtgen Forest nicknamed it the ""Death Factory."" This documentary features original film from US archives that bring the battle back to life.It's estimated that as many as 30 thousand US and German soldiers were killed in fighting in the northern Eifel region of Germany in the autumn and winter of 1944 and 1945. Traces of the battle - old bunkers, munitions, trenches and tank tracks - are still visible even today. The scarred landscape bears witness to a little-known chapter of World War Two. The ""H√ºrtgen Forest"" was the last obstacle standing between US forces and the Rhine River and Ruhr. Yet the decision to advance into the thick forest in September 1944 proved to be a fatal mistake. The Americans completely miscalculated North Eifel region's rugged terrain. They became disoriented in an area the German forces, the Wehrmacht, had crisscrossed with trenches and peppered with anti-personnel mines, making the wood into a veritable fortress. Continual rain and fog, followed by snow and frigid temperatures, turned the battle into a scene of dystopian butchery. Author Ernest Hemingway spent 18 days on the front in the H√ºrtgen Forest. He wrote later, ""It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there."" This documentary reconstructs the stages of the battle using commentary from survivors of the clash. Among them are the well-known US photographer Tony Vaccaro, US Army veteran James K. Cullen and former Wehrmacht soldier Paul Verbeek. In addition, H√ºrtgen Forest residents tell of the legacy of the battle, including the threat posed by countless unexploded munitions left in the ground 75 years after the conflict in Europe ended.";PT42M27S;02/05/2020;02/05/2020;3121;Left-Center;DW Documentary;/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q;UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q;20;tT0ob3cHPmE;"DW Documentary gives you information beyond the headlines.

The sexual abuse coupled with the uprising by the Protestant Wyatt against Queen Mary, which led to Elizabeth‚Äôs imprisonment in the Tower of London, may have resulted in the Queen‚Äôs deep mistrust of men.Elizabeth, the virgin Queen, the most powerful woman in English history. She emerged as a young princess against a backdrop of civil unrest, political intrigue, executions and coups. She ruled for 45 years and presided over a new kind of state. Her reign saw England emerge from the threat of European annexation to burst forth in a unique flowering of culture and became the world‚Äôs leading sea power. In this four part series David Starkey charts the rise and fall of her reign and reveals the powerful resonance it has for the present. This series covers one of the most glamorous and exciting reigns in English history, with bloodthirsty tales of sex, lust, murder and mayhem.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

Since then, he‚Äôs climbed Mount Everest in his shorts, resisted altitude sickness, completed a marathon in the Namib Desert with no water and proven under a laboratory setting that he‚Äôs able to influence his autonomic nervous system and immune system at will.Almost everything Wim has done was previously thought to be impossible - but he‚Äôs not a freak of nature.To demonstrate that any human can learn his methods, Wim offered to teach Matt Shea and Daisy-May Hudson to climb a freezing cold mountain in their shorts without getting cold.  But when Matt and Daisy signed up for the training, they had no idea that the so-called Iceman was planning to lead them on a psychedelic journey across Europe that circled the chasm between science, spirituality, and mystery.#Iceman #WimHof #VICEAsiaClick here to SUBSCRIBE to VICE Asia: https://bit.ly/2LhqAR9Connect with VICE Asia: Check out our full video catalog: https://bit.ly/2P3Y0pvVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com/en_asiaMore videos from the VICE network: https://fb.com/viceasia/videos/Like VICE Asia on Facebook: http://fb.com/viceasiaFollow VICE Asia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/viceasiaFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/viceasia/;PT39M53S;09/03/2020;09/03/2020;12425;;VICE Asia;/channel/UC8ZyfGD_qP-v75DGCzYQw6g;UC8ZyfGD_qP-v75DGCzYQw6g;19;soHwRkIkTHA;"Uncovering the wild, weird and wondrous in the far reaches of the world, VICE Asia is the definitive guide to the best of the region.

This is a complex question because these constructs are complex. I'm going to start by defining both of the terms. When we use the term psychopath, we're talking about some who has trait psychopathy and when we use the term narcissist, we're talking about someone who has trait narcissism. Neither one of these constructs is automatically indicative of pathology. If somebody has psychopathy that doesn't mean they have a mental disorder and if somebody has narcissism that doesn't mean to have a mental disorder. Mental disorders are classifications we see in places like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), but they don't necessarily relate to traits like certain traits that cluster together that we would call psychopathy or we would call narcissism. Psychopathy has two main types and narcissism does as well. With psychopathy, we see there's both primary and secondary psychopathy (sometimes these are called factor 1 and factor 2 psychopathy). Narcissism has two types: grandiose and vulnerable.Primary psychopathy has characteristics like being callous, unemotional, pathological lying, being manipulative, and being bold (fearless dominance). Secondary psychopathy has characteristics like being irresponsible, being impulsive, having a need for stimulation, and being involved in activities that could result in arrest. Grandiose narcissism has fantasies of success and power, jealousy, a sense of entitlement, arrogance, and being manipulative. With vulnerable narcissism, we see some of the same characteristics like insecurity, hypersensitivity to criticism, shame, guilt, and sadness.;PT21M14S;11/01/2019;11/01/2019;2232;Left-Center;Dr. Todd Grande;/channel/UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw;19;19RHMZH2Nh4;"Dr. Todd L.

ABOUT

Wim Hof (""The Iceman"") is the creator of the Wim Hof Method. Through more than thirty years of training in nature, he has developed a method that combines specific breathing techniques, cold exposure and mindset. This method has been the first to scientifically prove the ability to actively influence the innate immune system and the autonomic nervous system.

Wim holds 26 world records, and has numerous other feats under his belt. He ran a marathon under the Polar Circle in nothing but shorts, holds the world record for sitting in ice ‚Äîat almost two hours‚Äî and has climbed Mt. Everest to the Death Zone point, also in shorts.";31068646;0;845000;FALSE;124COVID-19 | Coronavirus: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Diagnostics;Education;4231271;79.020;2.447;HELP US GET OUR OWN FILMING STUDIO -- https://www.gofundme.com/f/ninja-nerd...Ninja Nerds,What is Corona virus? What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)¬†and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)¬†caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. ¬†Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.¬†It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO, 2020). Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the origin and zoonosis of COVID-19, the routes of transmission, epidemiology (current as of 3/15/2020), pathophysiology, and diagnostic tests used to identify COVID-19.

For the d√©trempe, fit a stand mixer with the hook attachment and stir the flour, water, milk, sugar, and yeast on low speed to blend, then add the salt. Increase to one speed higher and knead for about 4 minutes, adding the butter mid way through kneading ‚Äì the dough should just clean the sides of the bowl. Shape the dough into a rectangle (it will be soft), place it on a parchment lined baking tray and cover with a tea towel and then plastic wrap. Let the dough sit out for 90 minutes, then chill for at least an hour, up to 8 hours.Beurrage1. For the beurrage, shape the butter into an 8-inch square. Chill until ready to use if preparing in advance, but pull from the fridge to soften. Ensure that the butter offers the same resistance (is the same consistency) as the chilled dough ‚Äì while the temperature of each may differ, the ‚Äúgive‚Äù should be the same.2. On a floured work surface, turn out the chilled d√©trempe and roll out to a square about 14-inches across. Place the beurrage in the centre of the square, but rotated so that the points of the butter square fall at the middle of each flat side of the dough. Bring the corners of the dough together, wrapping the butter like an envelope and gently pinch the edges. Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 20-inches long and fold the dough into thirds (this is called a single fold). Return the dough to the baking tray, cover with the towel and plastic and chill for at least an hour, up to 8 hours.3. Repeat rolling and folding the dough into singles folds 2 more times, rotating the dough 90 degrees each time before rolling and chilling the dough for at least an hour and up to 8 hours before each fold. Let the dough rest for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours after the final fold before using.4. For 12 plain croissants, measure out about 20 oz of dough and store the rest in the fridge. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough to a rectangle about 16-inches by 12-inches. Cut the dough in half horizontally and then cut 6 triangles from each.5. Make a 1-inch score on the short side of each triangle, and roll up the croissant from this side. Curve the croissant so that the point of the triangle is at the bottom and pointing the opposite direction as the curve in. If you wish, you can pinch the croissant ends together so they hold the curve shape. Place these on a parchment ‚Äìlined baking tray, leaving at least 3 inches between each other and cover these with a tea towel and then plastic. Let the croissants rise for 2 hours.6. Preheat the oven to 375 F (190 C). Brush the croissants with the eggwash and then bake them for about 15 minutes until a rich golden brown.7. The croissants are best enjoyed the day they are baked. If you wish to prepare ahead, you can make the dough, fold it and let it rise, and then cut and shape the croissants. Freeze the croissants on a baking tray, then pack in a container. The croissants should fully thaw and proof for about 3 hours before then baking.Anna Olson Books: Buy Back to Baking with Anna Olson Recipe Book on Amazon: http://amzn.to/21CetiyComprar Reposter√≠a con Anna: 200 recetas dulces para compartir y disfrutar: http://amzn.to/21CeGCwBuy Another Cup of Sugar with Anna Olson Recipe Book on Amazon: http://amzn.to/21CeFOKBuy In The Kitchen with Anna Recipe Book on Amazon: http://amzn.to/21CeNhcBuy Fresh with Anna Olson - Seasonally Inspired Recipes to Share with Family and Friends on Amazon: http://amzn.to/21CePFOBuy Anna and Michael Olson Cook at Home by Anna Olson on Amazon: http://amzn.to/21CeQtEFollow Anna on social media: Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/chefannaolsonTwitter: https://twitter.com/olson_annaFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/chefannaolsonInstagram: https://instagram.com/chefannaolsonAnna's Official Website: http://annaolson.caFollow Oh Yum on...Facebook: https://facebook.com/ohyumfoodInstagram: https://instagram.com/ohyumfoodPinterest: https://pinterest.com/ohyumfoodTwitter: https://twitter.com/ohyum_foodOfficial Oh Yum Website: https://ohyum.tv#OhYum;PT11M28S;06/05/2016;06/05/2016;11354;;Oh Yum with Anna Olson;/channel/UCr_RedQch0OK-fSKy80C3iQ;UCr_RedQch0OK-fSKy80C3iQ;19;K689erbK3XI;Chef Anna Olson is here to teach you how to bake and cook every dish you could ever want to make!

I've been gardening for 30 years, 10 of which I was mentored by a University of California Certified Master Gardener.  

I don‚Äôt just love gardening, it is my passion and other than my family and friends, it is my life.  I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. 

Now, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.  
I only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.

I've been gardening for 30 years, 10 of which I was mentored by a University of California Certified Master Gardener.  

I don‚Äôt just love gardening, it is my passion and other than my family and friends, it is my life.  I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. 

Now, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.  
I only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.

If you want to make a donation, visit my Ko-fi page:https://ko-fi.com/scottpauljohnsonIn this video I attempt to cram a lot of music theory and guitar theory into a span of about 20 minutes. The ultimate goal is to think differently about the fingerboard while you're soloing. I'm hoping the visuals help do a lot of the talking haha.We start by talking about the hidden chords in the Pentatonic Scale and how to overlay them on top of the scale. The shapes are so transposable and usable that once you get the hang of it, your guitar solos will change forever and you'll get to be more specific.Practice Method #1:Just arpeggiate the shapes over the chord progression to get used to to the extra info in the pentatonic scale.Practice Method #2:End your phrases on notes that are part of the current chord. Keep it simple, maybe come up with a phrase that you know will end on a note thats part of the chord.Practice Method #3:If thats feeling easy, try to START and END phrases on notes that are part of the chord. You don't need to be perfect at it, its just about learning to be aware of the chord shapes.Practice Method #4:Very loosely just have fun with it. When you're on a note that is part of the chord, you can jump to another note thats part of the chord. This isn't a hard and fast music theory rule, but its a useful method of practice.;PT22M1S;27/06/2018;27/06/2018;12351;;Scott Paul Johnson;/channel/UCM7inNEZgbA3_ZPp2D6IAlw;UCM7inNEZgbA3_ZPp2D6IAlw;20;xjH7x3-JZCI;helpful stuff for guitar players;3943770;0;133000;FALSE;15MASSIVE MEAL PREP | LARGE FAMILY MEAL PREP;People & Blogs;243850;;;Hey guys!

Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression (1929-39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world up to that time.1929 Stock Market CrashDuring the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.Stock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock, producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading.1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great DepressionAfter October 29, 1929, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery during succeeding weeks. Overall, however, prices continued to drop as the United States slumped into the Great Depression, and by 1932 stocks were worth only about 20 percent of their value in the summer of 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did act to accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was also a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America‚Äôs banks had failed, and unemployment was approaching 15 million people, or 30 percent of the workforce.#Market #Crash #GeatDepression #documentary_films #Documentary #Full_Documentary #do—Åumentary #full_do—Åumentary #Do—Åumentary_Films #DocumentariesTrading StrategiesLive Trade CoachingBinary OptionsCFD'sFuturesEquitiesCommoditiesFX;PT58M36S;06/07/2018;06/07/2018;3153;;TradingCoachUK;/channel/UC5N-VmtsksN1xfPV1sdB__g;UC5N-VmtsksN1xfPV1sdB__g;20;qlSxPouPCIM;;38566865;0;129000;FALSE;75How to Make an Eggshell & Vinegar Fertilizer to Manage Blossom End Rot - Recipe & Use:  DIY Ep-2;Howto & Style;698646;9.880;399;I show you all the steps to make an eggshell solution that you can water into your container tomato plants and other plants.

This is our April update on our previous lecture to keep all of our viewers informed on the new research and publications that have been released on COVID-19. Please be aware‚Äî This lecture is up to date as of April 17, 2020. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. ¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.World Health Organization (WHO) | 8 April 2020Adventitious Lung sounds: Referenced from easyauscultation.comREFERENCES | We have a thorough list of our references in AMA format found on our Facebook & Instagram social media sites Support us by purchasing apparel and donating to our PayPal or Patreon! üòÑ--Become a Patron of ours and receive the final, high resolution photo of the lecture!FUNDINGGoFundMe | https://www.gofundme.com/ninja-nerd-s...APPAREL |Amazon Prime Free Delivery | https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Nerd-Sci...Teespring | https://teespring.com/stores/ninja-nerd PATREON | https://www.patreon.com/NinjaNerdScienceSOCIAL MEDIAFACEBOOK | https://www.facebook.com/NinjaNerdSci...INSTAGRAM | https://www.instagram.com/ninjanerdsc...ALSO, check out our Medical channel | Ninja Nerd Medicine!https://www.youtube.com/ninjanerdmedi...;PT42M0S;21/04/2020;21/04/2020;1535;Least Biased;Ninja Nerd Science;/channel/UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ;UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ;20;hIxwizlu4w8;"Ninja Nerd Science is here to provide a thorough and detailed approach to science courses including anatomy and physiology, organic chemistry, biochemistry, general chemistry, and biology.

If a speaker has 8ohms, and you wire 6 of them up in series, the resistance will be 48ohms (6 x 8 = 48), which is too much for an amplifier. Wiring them in parallel results in 1.4Ohms (8 / 6 = 1.333) which is too little for the amplifier. So, what I did was divide the 6 speakers into 3 sets of 2, and wire each set of 2 together in series for 16ohm. I then connected these 3 16ohm sets in parallel to result in an overall resistance of 5.4Ohms, which should be within a typical expected range for an amplifier (4 to 8 ohms).;PT15M8S;29/10/2019;29/10/2019;4544;;DIY Perks;/channel/UCUQo7nzH1sXVpzL92VesANw;UCUQo7nzH1sXVpzL92VesANw;19;puFSdfIRNIw;"I'm Matt, and here on DIY Perks you'll find plenty of interesting DIY projects on a variety of topics, including computers, woodworking, electronics, audio, and more!

Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =] Full disclosure, I have watched a few episodes of House before but this was probably 10 years ago so I decided to go ahead and start this tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( House MD episode 1 ) of the series. I was really curious to see the difference in watching the show now that I am a licensed doctor. The last time I watched the program I was in high school and knew a tenth of the medical knowledge I know now! Honestly, I love this medical tv show series because I think it allows us to laugh at some of the crazy situations Hugh Laurie gets himself into. Plus It gave an interesting look at what life is like as an infectious disease doctor especially one as highly regarded as Dr. House. Obviously, the way that he practices medicine is not realistic or accurate because we don't break into people's homes nor do we treat them without explaining what we are doing. All in all, I think Dr. House is a must watch tv show if you're into medical dramas just for laughs alone.I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches House M.D. / Real Doctor Reacts to House M.D. If you want me to continue making this series please like the video and leave me a comment on which show or episode you'd like for me to review next.

But there have never been recommended limits for sugar on Canadian food labels, despite emerging research that suggests the sweet stuff may be making more of us fat and sick. In the fifth estate‚Äôs season premiere, Gillian Findlay digs into the surprising science ‚Äî and the reaction from the food industry ‚Äî to reveal The Secrets of Sugar. Has the sugar industry been hiding an unsavoury truth from consumers?A small but influential group of medical researchers is stirring up the health debate, linking sugar not just to rising obesity rates but also to a host of diseases including cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer‚Äôs.We put a family of four on a healthy diet to try to beat their sugar habit and track the surprising results. We talk to leading scientists ‚Äì and their critics. And we ask the food industry why those ingredient labels are far from clear when it comes to how much sugar is really on your plate.Original airdate : October 4th, 2013For more on the fifth estate : http://www.cbc.ca/fifthFollow us on Twitter : http://www.twitter.com/cbcfifthLike us on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/thefifthestate;PT42M0S;03/10/2014;03/10/2014;3144;Left-Center;CBC News;/channel/UCuFFtHWoLl5fauMMD5Ww2jA;UCuFFtHWoLl5fauMMD5Ww2jA;20;K3ksKkCOgTw;"As Canada's national public news and information service, the CBC is committed to a set of values that include accuracy, fairness, balance, impartiality and integrity.

Having presented at over 500 colleges and Universities nationwide, hundreds of leadership symposiums, and countless local and regional organizations, Adam Carroll‚Äôs message of Building A Bigger Life, Not a Bigger Lifestyle has been heard by over 200,000+ people.In early 2014, Adam successfully crowd-funded a documentary on student loan debt, raising nearly $70,000 in 45 days. The film, Broke Busted & Disgusted is due out in early 2015 and is already garnering critical acclaim. The mission of the film is to start a national debate about changing the way we fund college and not crippling 20 somethings with mountains of debt.Adam‚Äôs core message is we are all after the same thing ‚Äì to relentlessly pursue our passions, live simply and happily, and make a difference to those around us.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

This video focuses on the single-stem method of pruning, where tomato plants are limited to a single main stem.Pruning your tomatoes is very important for fruit production and disease resistance.  Pruning your tomatoes to a single main stem usually provides the largest fruit possible.  Allowing multiple main stems usually results in smaller fruit, and it makes it very difficult to support your plants with stakes.  If you want to grow with two main stems, I suggest you trellis your tomatoes as shown in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kwHD...I do not recommend allowing more than two main stems because fruit size starts to suffer and the plants get very bushy and difficult to manage.Staking your tomatoes and growing them vertically is extremely important to prevent disease from killing your plants.  Blight is the #1 disease that affects tomatoes, and it comes from soil-borne fungus.  Keeping your tomatoes high and dry - not allowing them to sit in wet dirt or get splashed by rain ricocheting off the dirt - will help lessen disease pressure.  This also helps prevent viruses and bacteria, such as leaf spot and a myriad of other tomato afflictions.Pruning is also important to keep disease pressure lower.  Pruning unnecessary growth creates more airflow.  Airflow keeps your leaves dry, and fungi, bacteria and viruses need damp leaves to grow.  The drier you keep your foliage, the less disease pressure you have and the best way to keep your foliage dry is to plant your tomatoes in the sunniest location possible with the best airflow possible.*********************************************************VISIT MY AMAZON STOREFRONT TO SEE THE PRODUCTS I USE MOST OFTEN IN MY GARDEN*:https://www.amazon.com/shop/themillen...*********************************************************EQUIPMENT I MOST OFTEN USE IN MY GARDEN (INDIVIDUAL LINKS)*:Jobe‚Äôs Organics All Purpose Granular Fertilizer, 16 lb https://amzn.to/312gVpYJobe‚Äôs Organics Vegetable and Tomato Fertilizer, 16 lb https://amzn.to/31h2XQQJobe‚Äôs Organics Fruit & Citrus Fertilizer, 16lb https://amzn.to/312hBvwJobe's Organics Bone Meal Fertilizer, 4 lb https://amzn.to/2N3ZBh4Miracle-Gro Soluble Tomato Plant Food, 1.5 lb https://amzn.to/2GDgJ8nMiracle-Gro Soluble Tomato Plant Food, 3 lb  https://amzn.to/2HUWCn4Miracle-Gro Soluble All Purpose Plant Food, 1 lb https://amzn.to/2LQbnuWMiracle-Gro Soluble All Purpose Plant Food, 3 lb https://amzn.to/2LNsHAw Miracle-Gro Soluble Bloom Booster, 1.5 lb https://amzn.to/2GKYG0jEpso Grow Epsom Salt, 5 lb https://amzn.to/2ZKiXP7Neptune's Harvest Crab Shell Plant Food, 4lb https://amzn.to/2A4Y3KYEspoma PO6 Potash, 6 lb https://amzn.to/2PZ2ylfAlaska Fish Fertilizer, 1 Quart https://amzn.to/302btCpAlaska Fish Fertilizer, 1 Gallon https://amzn.to/2HTCjX5Alaska MORBLOOM Fertilizer, 1 Gallon https://amzn.to/34x1ybiLiquid Kelp Organic Seaweed Extract, 1 Gallon https://amzn.to/2LyDlbSSouthern Ag Liquid Copper Fungicide https://amzn.to/2HTCKRdSouthern Ag Natural Pyrethrin Concentrate https://amzn.to/2UHSNGEBonide Wettable Sulfur Plant Fungicide https://amzn.to/300UrV0Lilly Miller Wettable Sulfur Dust, 1 lb https://amzn.to/2PW0XwESafer Brand BT Caterpillar Killer Concentrate https://amzn.to/2N3AavXGarden Safe Slug & Snail Bait https://amzn.to/2PXmuoGOrganic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Neem Oil, 16 oz https://amzn.to/2PZLtHOOrganic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Neem Oil, 32 oz https://amzn.to/315s4pTCaptain Jack Dead Bug Dust, 4 Lb https://amzn.to/2ZZDxGqSevin Ready-to-Use 5% Dust 3-Pack, 1 lb https://amzn.to/2N49j2O2 Gallon Compression Sprayer https://amzn.to/2UEy1bdOrganza Bags to protect small fruits (3""x4""): https://amzn.to/31uAbfyOrganza Bags to protect medium fruits (4""x4.72""): https://amzn.to/2YuCXnbOrganza Bags to protect large fruits (6""x9""): https://amzn.to/316EC084' Weed Barrier Ground Cover, 300' (SELECT ""PACK OF 1""): https://amzn.to/31lTtUz*********************************************************ABOUT MY GARDEN:Location: Southeastern NC, Brunswick County (greater Wilmington area)Zone 8A*********************************************************FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER @NCGardening FOR GARDEN UPDATES AND PHOTOS!https://twitter.com/NCGardening**********************************************************As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.";PT17M3S;25/05/2019;25/05/2019;3441;;The Millennial Gardener;/channel/UCAXUwGU47XVY-0lH9qhUr1Q;UCAXUwGU47XVY-0lH9qhUr1Q;19;6lqlTQKX5PQ;"This channel is dedicated to my love of gardening.  I live in southeastern, coastal North Carolina, five minutes southwest of Wilmington in humid subtropical Zone 8a, latitude 34¬∞10'39"" N (34.17N).

Growing up in south Jersey, my father and grandfather both had gardens.  As a child, I used to help them plant seedlings and pick vegetables.  As a teen, I worked on a local farm.  After college, I lived in Philadelphia, so I had to garden out of buckets.  My love for all things outdoors has taken me to the south where land is more plentiful, growing seasons are long and winters mild, but with a few deep freezes in the mid-to-low teens annually that make my hardiness zone a real challenge.

I am a zone pusher.  In this channel, I will grow a lot of the common edible annuals we all know and love, but I will also grow many things that ""you can't grow"" in Zone 8a.  I am young and have a long journey ahead of me with a lot more to learn, and I invite you along for the ride with me.";2204862;0;26000;FALSE;176Are BLOOD CLOTS the reason why COVID19 patients are dying? (Blood thinners to save lives?);Education;192714;6.307;106;So are blood clots at least part of the reason why some people with COVID-19 are dying?I can tell you that the number of clotting problems my colleagues are seeing in the ICU across the country, all related to Covid-19, is unprecedented. But this isn‚Äôt just a bunch of doctors and nurses that I know who are reporting this. A recent Dutch study found that of the 184 patients in the ICU with Covid-19 pneumonia, 20% were having clotting issues. There was also a similar study in Wuhan, China where 25% hospitalized COVID patients had clots. Why, and how is SARS-CoV-2, which invades the cells of the lungs, specifically they type II alveoli, how is it causing blood clots to form in the body? When someone has a severe case of COVID-19, its causing a ton of inflammation within the lungs. This inflammation is what is triggering the blood clots to develop. We knew that this happens with ARDS even before COVID-19 came around. In ARDS, these patients usually develop microthrombi, meaning tiny clots, that form in the tiny blood vessels in the lungs. And these microthrombi can combine to form bigger thrombi, meaning bigger clots. This happens at least partly because of the cytokine storm that develops as a result of the infection. Blood clots are also a concern with seriously ill people in general, regardless of what illness they have, because these patients aren‚Äôt moving much, if at all, and lack of movement further predisposes one to having clots. And that‚Äôs why when patients are admitted to an intensive care unit, we usually given them blood thinners, unless there is a reason not to, for example if they have bleeding, we don‚Äôt want to give those patients blood thinners. But when we give these blood thinners, we give them in prophylactic doses, meaning the intention is to reduce their risk of developing a clot in the first place. But these prophylactic doses are considered low dose. And the chances of someone having severe bleeding from these small doses is very small. But the blood clots with COVID-19, these are just a whole ‚Äònother beast. There‚Äôs something more going on here. So how, and why is COVID-19 causing more blood clots than usual?Long story short, the virus enters the alveolar cells in the lungs using the ACE2 receptor, and once it does that, it causes the cell to have less ACE2 receptor on its surface. This increases the amount of 3 things within the lungs: 1) inflammation 2) formation of clots and 3) constriction of blood vessels going to the lungs, meaning pulmonary vasoconstriction. And guess what, each and every one of these things by itself can lead to low oxygen levels. So you can imagine what that means when you have all 3 of these things going on at the same time. The way that oxygen gets into our blood from the alveoli, it has to diffuse from the alveoli to our capillaries. The cytokine storm causes destruction of the alveolus and the endothelium, and this is a trigger for clotting. We knew this happens in ARDS even before COVID. But guess what, the virus that causes covid can actually invade the cells here in the endothelium because these cells have ACE2 receptors as well. And that can cause even more inflammation and more clotting.And these clots can combine with other clots, to form bigger clots, and can travel to other parts of the body. And in another published report in the NEJM, there were 3 patients in the ICU who had COVID-19 , and these 3 patients developed blood clots that were significant enough to cause major blockages in blood vessels. These 3 patients were positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. These antibodies are not in the blood for the vast majority of people. These antiphospholipid antibodies are bad because they attack phospholipid proteins in our body, and if severe enough, they can cause major clots to form in our blood vessels. Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome is a condition that depends on someone‚Äôs genetics. But these antibodies can also arise transiently in patients with critical illness and various infections. So do all patients with COVID-19 who have blood clots, do they all have this transient anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome? We don‚Äôt know yet.The cytokine storm that is triggered in the lungs, that can affect other organs in the body, such as heart, kidneys, and brain. And as if that‚Äôs not bad enough, just about all of the other organs in the body have ACE2 receptors, such as the heart, kidneys, and brain.;PT17M25S;29/04/2020;29/04/2020;1234;Least Biased;Doctor Mike Hansen;/channel/UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A;UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A;20;qoJ4VDaGSfY;"Mike Hansen, MD, is a medical doctor who is an internist, an intensivist, and a pulmonologist.

They are a 6 tone sequence of special electromagnetic frequencies. They were originally used in Gregorian chants many hundreds of years ago, and recently, they were brought back to everybody‚Äôs attention for their healing powers.These frequencies induce movements of consciousness that will help stimulate new changes that are necessary for individuals who would like to achieve awakening. it has been said that these frequencies have helped many individuals throughout the centuries to undo difficult situations, to change their perspective of things, to turn sadness into happiness, but above all, it has also helped many to reconnect with their own true selves.The frequencies are the following:‚òÖ 396 Hertz: DO. It is usually related to guilt and fear, and how they can suppress other emotions as well. It is associated with the color red.‚òÖ 417 Hertz: RE. It is usually related to past trauma and negativity and the willingness to change. This frequency can help you to recognize those past traumas that are no longer valuable in your life. It is associated with the color orange.‚òÖ 528 Hertz: MI. It is usually related to DNA, peace of mind and clarity. This frequency will help you heal and remove any sickness you may have. It is associated with the color yellow.‚òÖ 639 Hertz: FA. It is usually related to Interpersonal relationships. This frequency will help you heal those difficult relationships you still have from the past while also reconnecting with those who are valuable in your present. It is associated with the color green.‚òÖ 741 Hertz: SOL. It is usually related to the emotional stability you are looking for. This frequency will help you solve any problems you may have in your life. It is associated with the color blue.‚òÖ 852 Hertz: LA. It is usually related to the views of oneself and the universe. It requires open space in order to allow intuition to come in. It is associated with the color indigo.‚òÖ 963 Hertz: SI. it is usually related to the feeling of oneness. It means awakening and interconnected to the universe. This frequency helps you to reconnect with yourself. It is associated with the color purple.And this isn‚Äôt something new either, as ancient civilizations from all areas of the world seemed to use music as therapy, in all of its forms. The greeks used flutes or lyres, the Mesopotamians used the harp, or the Incas used the flutes (or quena as they are traditionally known).  Choose a Solfeggio frequency track: Perhaps you would like to start at the beginning? It doesn‚Äôt matter, as there isn‚Äôt a specific order for them to be played‚Ä¶in fact, you can choose to do one if you would like to focus on that specific frequency for the time being.

Google LDN!:

Joseph Wouk, son of Novelist Herman Wouk, in this half hour video tells the story of how his life was saved and all his symptoms relieved from Progressive Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS). Considered the rarest and worst variety of MS, Wouk had been told by the best MS doctor on the west coast at UCSF that there was nothing that could be done to help progressive MS. The doctor was wrong. Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) has been halting the progression of progressive MS for the last 20 years. The only reason it remains relatively unknown is because it is a generic drug, nobody has been willing to spend the 30 million dollars necessary to get FDA Approval for the drug figuring they couldn't recover their investment.";11691334;0;34600;FALSE;542Nightly News: Kids Edition (May 7, 2020) | NBC Nightly News;News & Politics;82890;;;¬ª Subscribe to NBC News: http://nbcnews.to/SubscribeToNBC¬ª Watch more NBC video: http://bit.ly/MoreNBCNewsNBC News is a leading source of global news and information.

Episodes 1-4. StarMediaEN;Film & Animation;2287319;6.708;1.218;All episodes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USUA_...In 1613 The Zemsky Sobor (the National Assembly) adopted a decision to invite Michael Fyodorovich Romanov to become tsar of Russia. This decision was announced in Red Square in front of numerous crowds of people: ‚ÄúMichael Fyodorovich shall be tsar and lord of Muscovy and all the Russian state.‚Äù In order to prevent disturbances, Michael Romanov had to take a terrible sin upon his soul ‚Äì to execute a 3 year-old boy‚Ä¶ The most vivid pages of Russian history and the establishment and consolidation of Russian state power are associated with the eighteen Russian Tsars of the House of Romanov which include such historic names as Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Nicholas I and Alexanders I, II and III. The dynasty ended with the brutal assassination of the last Tsar, Nicholas II and his family by the Bolsheviks in Ekaterinburg in 1917.The Romanov dynasty played a hugely important role in world history, and the series highlights the life stories and characters of the tsars, recounting their rise to power and their contribution to the dynasty, their merits and their faults, their achievements and mistakes, their victories and defeats in war.The series also examines the Russian form of 'Caesarism' as a system of state administration - its advantages and drawbacks and how the Russian state changed under the Romanov's rule.THE ROMANOVS is told in eight epic one-hour episodes using a unique combination of magnificent CGI animation and dramatic reconstruction with careful and accurate attention paid to each period.Type: TV seriesGenre: docudramaYear of production: 2013Duration: 8x52 minutesDirected by: Maksim BespalyiWritten by: Marina Bandilenko, Marina UlybyshevaDirector of photography: Ivan BarkhvartProducers: Valeriy Babich, Vlad Ryashin, Sergey Titinkov, Konstantin ErnstWatch movies and TV series for free in high quality.Explore a great collection of documentaries.The best Russian movies and tv series, melodrama, war movies, military tv shows, new russian films, top documentary films and full movies with english subtitle.With these free online Russian language movies you will learn Russian easily.Subscribe for high quality movies and series on our channel.Enjoy Watching!#StarMediaEN;PT206M59S;12/10/2018;12/10/2018;3122;;StarMediaEN;/channel/UCuSx-lf2ft7hPceGVNHybOw;UCuSx-lf2ft7hPceGVNHybOw;20;46DEVQ8UacA;"Watch movies and TV series for free in high quality.

We need to establish ethical standards in dealing with artificial intelligence - and to answer the question: What still makes us as human beings unique?Mankind is still decades away from self-learning machines that are as intelligent as humans. But already today, chatbots, robots, digital assistants and other artificially intelligent entities exist that can emulate certain human abilities. Scientists and AI experts agree that we are in a race against time: we need to establish ethical guidelines before technology catches up with us.  While AI Professor J√ºrgen Schmidhuber predicts artificial intelligence will be able to control robotic factories in space, the Swedish-American physicist Max Tegmark warns against a totalitarian AI surveillance state, and the philosopher Thomas Metzinger predicts a deadly AI arms race. But Metzinger also believes that Europe in particular can play a pioneering role on the threshold of this new era: creating a binding international code of ethics.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

These are cytosolic receptors.https://www.newscientist.com/article/...Deficiency of vitamin D makes people more susceptible to respiratory tract infections.Vitamin D supplement can reduce these infections by 12% Keep in mind, this is for those who are deficient in this vitamin. If you are not deficient, then it will not make a difference. Because, you are already good.Evidence is not sufficient to say that vitamin D helps prevent respiratory infections.2018 Studyhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...People with autoimmune diseases commonly have hypovitaminosis DWhat are cathelicidins?https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/...What are beta defensins?https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_...2011 Studyhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...Activation of TLR and PAMPs on macrophages increases the production of 1, alpha hydroxylase and the VDR.

Regulating the immune response.Vitamin D acts on the dendritic cells to inhibit/reduce their differentiation and maturation. It reduces their MHCII expression, co-stimulatory molecules like CD40, CD80, CD86, decreased production of IL-12 etc.2013 Studyhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...Vitamin D improves immune system by helping produce cathelicidine and by helping modulate inflammatory cascade. Especially for the respiratory infections.It also helps produce NFk-B (nuclear factor kappa light chain for activated B cells.)(Notes about the NFkBhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF-%CE%BABHelps with cytokine production and cell survival.NFk-B factor becomes active when T and B cell receptors become active. Its activation causes the gene expressions that allow T cell development, maturation, and proliferation.T and B cells have Vitamin D receptors that help them produce NFk-B)Continuing the notes from the study:In pulmonary infections. Lung epithelial cells are able to convert inactive vitamin D to its active form. This active Vitamin D then helps produce cathelicidine. Which helps kill the pathogens.Vitamin D seems to favor TH2 and TH17 cell activation which is anti-inflammatory profile. Vitamin D seems to reduce the activation of TH1 cells which are pro inflammatory by their IFN-gamma action.A deficiency of vitamin D may dysregulate the inflammatory response of the body.Vitamin B also increases the IkBa.

They are stronger than the deep reach clamps made by Matthias Wandel & John Heisz, (that was a challenge guys ÔÅä). And mine don‚Äôt have any metal in them!Here is the Tap & die set I used for this job:http://amzn.to/2pLgH3V You can make these 12‚Äù deep reach C-Clamps with amazing strength for only $10.00! I was about to buy some for a project but the quality ones I found were $107.00 online, so I did some research and decided to make mine.I studied some material properties, and of all domestics, oak has the second highest modulus of elasticity behind only hickory. With over 1.8 million pounds/sq.in.  Modulus of elasticity defines the relationship between stress and strain, and effectively measures stiffness. The exact property you want in the arm of a clamp.  I also found a study done with Fine Woodworking Magazine & Case Western Reserve University in 2007 measuring glue bond strengths. It utilized 6 glue types and different species of wood, 162 joints tested in all. Among the domestics, red oak combined with type 1 PVA glue (Titebond), had by far the greatest bond strength.  So, it was a no-brainer. Oak, is cheap as a hardwood. You can buy #2 common, because narrow sizes are all that is needed. And, many people have oak offcuts hanging around.I did buy a 36‚Äù maple dowel for the screw thread. It was a 1-1/2‚Äù diameter. You could certainly turn one. But for me this was easier. And one dowel makes 2 clamps. I made 2 clamps with the intention of testing them to destruction, but I didn‚Äôt have a strong enough scale. After I get one and do that, I think I‚Äôll make 10 for my shop, and I‚Äôll have paid less than buying a single one online.I did cut all the threads and tapped the clamp. This is easy to do.Detailed plans are available on my website if you are interested in duplicating these. http://kingsfinewoodworking.comNOTE: Matthias Wandel, and John Heisz are both fantastic woodworkers.

Denver, CO 80220";19855568;0;208000;FALSE;126Life in North Korea | DW Documentary;Education;4994579;53.078;3.634;Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it‚Äôs known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Clearly the other side just doesn‚Äôt have all the facts, right? Or are they really that stupid? In this fascinating and hilarious talk, cognitive scientist Philip Fernbach peels back the layers of what we really know and reveals some surprising truths about the human mind. Philip Fernbach is a cognitive scientist and professor in the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Co-author of The Knowledge Ilusion: Why We Never Think Alone, Philip's research focuses on why we think we know more than we actually do and the implications this has on individuals and society.

We know this tends to be more associated, as a behavior anyway, with narcissism and psychopathy. Somebody doesn't have to be narcissistic or psychopathic to be manipulative.

And unless you are a Type 4, we generally don't like thinking about it ahead of time üòÇIt is valuable for each type to reckon with their coping mechanism towards death, whether grief is an inch away or a mile.  I'm here if you need to talk about anything.     -ChristopherType 1 -   ""Truth allows me to stay in control of negative feelings."" Type 1 may lean on religion or some other system of though in which bad experiences are recontextualized as in service of some greater ""good.""   This can make 1's woody and procedural in times of sorrow as they try to quarantine their unconscious impulses.Type 2 - Poor 2's. They take loss extremely hard. When they lose someone, they lose a special part of themselves as well,  It's as if an entire ""room"" of their life is closed off and shuttered forever.  The grief flows two ways: the first is a feeling of uselessness in that there is no longer a channel for the living person to provide anything of any use to the deceased, but also the living person can feel acutely ""love-starved"" due to the deceased person's absence. Nothing left to give, nothing left to receive.Type 3- The pressure to keep up a winning image, even when there is no one left to see.Type 4 - The 4 is special in their courage to KNOW their feelings. A lot of us other types try to outrun & avoid our feelings. But 4's are determined to acquaint themselves with grief before it happens aka ""pre-grieving.""  However, pre-grieving comes with it's own pricetag.Type 5 -  To the Five, the best response to death is to abstract it away.  Even making this video as a Type 5 myself, there is a need to blow apart the experience of death and see it from many angles, almost as a way of diluting my own internal experience of death..Type 6:  Logistics are an act of hope!Type 7:  LOL do type 7's have an attention span to scroll through this much text? If so, I posted an excellent analysis from a Type 7 on Reddit in the comments.Type 8:   Typically Type 8's have a desire to manage or facilitate the space of grief. This reinforces a self-image of being strong.  If 8's can channel their powers into facilitating a space of vulnerability and catharsis (even for themselves), they are golden.Type 9: The way that Type 4's ""pre-grieve"", 9s can cope with their fear of separation by ""pre-separating.""  This looks like detaching self from others beforehand in a controlled manner, so that they are never surprised by someone ripping themselves away in the future.   Pre-separating can also look like narcotizing the self with media and alcohol or a host of other distractions, so that the mind is numb to whatever inevitable blow.";PT6M33S;07/12/2019;07/12/2019;103;;RockBridgeIsland;/channel/UCclbeGw9IqdJoTwsKV3kEbA;UCclbeGw9IqdJoTwsKV3kEbA;20;3P8cuGtg-Tw;"A lot of people call me CDT, but you can also call me Christopher :).

Sexual conflict pervades the mating arena prior to sex, after a mating relationship has formed, and in the aftermath of a romantic breakup. Love has a central place in human sexual psychology, but conflict and exploitation pervade human mating - something we must all confront in order to control our own mating destiny. American psychologist David M. Buss is a leading researcher and author in the field of evolutionary psychology and human sex differences in partner selection. The 2005/2016 book The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by Buss, is considered the definitive text on the subject. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

We start with the precision work necessary to remove the existing shower walls while being very careful not to damage the existing ceiling. Since the ceiling is in great condition we want to protect it so we do not increase the scope of work when finishing the new shower renovation later. This allows us to avoid patching and painting the ceiling.After the demolition in our bathroom remodel  is done we begin the process of redoing the plumbing supply and drain and shower valve. In this video we switched from copper to pex and used a pex ready shower valve and crimping pex line system to install.After the plumbing was in place we moved on to the installation of the tub. By using a tub with reinforced fiberglass spray and plywood with legs on the bottom it made it really easy to install directly on the floor without leveling. This type of tub makes bathroom renovations really easy.After the tub was securely fastened to the framing we closed the walls using Schluter kerdi board. In this video we show 2 different ways to seal up the penetrations of the shower waterproofing system.After we waterproof the shower we begin the subway tiling immediately using a laser level to achieve a perfect level line on the bottom row of tile. We demonstrate how to cut and install subway tile using basic tile cutting tools that anyone can afford as well as how to install a glass mosaic tile  along with finishing the tile with edging for a clean sharp line.After the we tile and grout the walls in this bathroom remodel we demonstrate how to finish the bathroom renovation by installing the plumbing fixtures and sealing all the joints and fixtures.Of course no bathroom renovation is complete without finishing the walls in the area and getting them ready for paint so we show you an industry secret for making this a fast a perfect result without a mess.And finally since we were installing this new bathtub in an old space we did not have any extra tile for repairs in the event of damage. Sure enough we chipped a tile while resizing the floor tile for the new tub. No worries I show you a quick fix that can save your bacon if you are trying to renovate your bathroom on a budget like this client.As always feel free to leave comments in the area below about your bathroom renovation or remodel and Yes I do answer all the questions myself.

What role did trauma, psychopathy, narcissism, and borderline personality traits play in turning Aileen Wuornos into a serial killer?Narcissism:There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.Psychopathy:There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.Borderline Personality Disorder:In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), we see nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder and five have to be met for a diagnosis. The symptom criteria include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in two areas that are potentially self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder, so it‚Äôs in the same cluster is antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders.Arrigo, B. A., & Griffin, A.

No diagnostic manual can truly explain the multifaceted experience of autism. It‚Äôs a neurological difference with a vast spectrum of representation within its population. It can come with remarkable gifts and skills as well as devastating traits. Autism does not necessarily equal disability and thankfully today, we have a word, that challenges this negative terminology. Neurodiversity. In her talk, Elisabeth communicates how it is to be autistic yet lead an independent and successful everyday life. Born and raised in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere in Sweden, Elisabeth Wiklander moved to Amsterdam to study and work before she acquired a highly competitive position at the London Philharmonic Orchestra. She is no stranger to trying new things and reaching for her dreams. Besides being passionate about nature, rock climbing and playing cello, Elisabeth is autistic and was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome when she was 28 years old. Until then, she had no explanations for her sometimes different thoughts and behaviour.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Our relationship with our parents is perhaps the most impactful, since it shapes us from such a young age. Dr. Ramani breaks down the signs your parent is a narcissist and what to do about it.According to world-renowned narcissism expert Dr. Ramani Durvasula, the majority of us have at least one relationship with a narcissist - and these narcissists take an absolutely debilitating toll on our mental health and emotional health. Additionally, most people make serious (and avoidable) mistakes when trying to navigate these relationships.So most victims of narcissistic relationships feel frustrated, confused, helpless, invalidated, dehumanized, and exhausted. If you don‚Äôt know the fundamental signs of a narcissist, they are extremely difficult to spot. Even if you don't realize it, they can instill intense feelings of low self-worth, insecurity, and depression in their victims.Make sure to watch the rest of this 6-episode series on narcissistic relationships to learn how to deal with every type of narcissistic relationship in your life. #Narcissism #Relationships #MedCircle;PT14M40S;12/01/2020;12/01/2020;17554;Least Biased;MedCircle;/channel/UCyGOloOIJWt8NlE4tnejQeA;UCyGOloOIJWt8NlE4tnejQeA;20;Rt2n2jE7NvA;"MedCircle brings you engaging mental health interviews with world-class psychiatrists & psychologists every single week.

She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP.

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game?

Where does Gina get her recipes?Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things.Why does she make such large portions?When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldn‚Äôt have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out!Why is no one helping her in the video?Grandma Gina doesn‚Äôt want help! Usually, it‚Äôs because we will slow her down or not do it ‚Äúher way.‚Äù For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step.  Why don‚Äôt we buy her a new...?Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etc‚Ä¶ but she doesn‚Äôt like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty!Who is behind the camera?Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen.Does Gina read the comments?We print out and show her how much love she gets from all her viewers, and she is very thankful and hopes you enjoy her cooking!

But legends about the Nazi dictator's lived on. Was his body ever found? Did he manage to escape?After Hitler, aides poured gasoline on his body and set it alight in the garden of his chancellery. A few days later, the Soviets discovered the remains. But the body was burned beyond recognition, and they could not be sure it was his. Only after a top-secret investigation could Hitler be positively identified, thanks to information provided by his dentist. At the same time, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin publicly stated that his army had been unable to find Hitler‚Äôs body. Wild rumors swirled about Hitler's death. Stalin even accused some of the Allies of helping him escape. What were the secrets behind this deception? What happened to the two German women who helped identify Hitler's body?-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The unemployment rate spiked to 14.7% from 4.4% in March, which would also be a record based on monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics data going back to 1948 ‚Äî and government economists say that could in fact be 5 percentage points higher.On Thursday, weekly unemployment insurance claims were shown to have totaled another nearly 3.2 million for the week ended May 2, bringing the cumulative number since the week ended March 20 to more than 33 million.Still, the data did little to shake equities‚Äô advance. Investors have mostly taken the grisly economic data reported so far in stride, with much of it rendered outdated by developments in the coronavirus pandemic, and plans to reopen some businesses roll in by the day. The reopening strategy offers hope of some respite from the shelter-in-place orders that have induced much of the economic damage.‚ÄúThe prevailing sentiment seems to be one of optimism in response to the economic reopening, tempered by the lack of forward operating visibility and muted fears of a second wave of virus infections,‚Äù David Joy, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a note Thursday.On the U.S.-China trade front, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released a statement saying U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with China‚Äôs Vice Premier Liu He. Both sides ‚Äúagreed that good progress is being made‚Äù in discussions over the implementation of the U.S.-China Phase One trade deal.‚ÄúBoth countries fully expect to meet their obligations under the agreement in a timely manner,‚Äù the statement continued, helping to assuage concerns of escalating tensions between the two sides amid the global pandemic, which President Donald Trump has blamed on China.Market participants are also betting that policymakers will to continue providing support with further stimulus measures as needed to ensure businesses and financial markets are able to make it to the other side of the pandemic.Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said during an NBC Today show interview Thursday that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to avert the kind of Depression scenario, because policy makers are going to continue to be aggressive to fight that outcome,‚Äù while acknowledging ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in for a long, gradual recovery.‚Äù And also on Thursday, Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said in a Bloomberg TV interview that the U.S. Fed still has more tools to use to support economic activity.‚Äî8:30 a.m. ET: Stocks hold gains after unprecedented collapse in jobs dataWall Street continues to hope for the best after April‚Äôs jobs data showed 20.5 million people lost their jobs last month ‚Äî a historic plunge yet better than economists expected.

Although the colorful icons called emojis can no longer be ignored in our daily communication, little is known about it. Who has power over the emoji? Where are emojis coming from?There is one ""High Council"" of online communication that is difficult to access and has the power over our emoji selection on the keyboard: The Unicode Consortium. This group is difficult to access and meets four times a year on the west coast of the United States. This tech giants committee makes decisions about language and shapes the infrastructure of the online world. Representatives from Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, IBM, Netflix, Amazon, and Intel set the global standard for symbols, characters, and fonts in digital (visual) language so that all our devices can communicate with each other effortlessly.Part of Unicode is the twelve-member ""Emoji Commission."" Director Mea Dols de Jong got a foot in the door during the quarterly meeting at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Seattle, but also ran into the shocking closedness of the tech sector. The deeper she delves into the world behind the seemingly little icons, the better she sees that this micro-world is a reflection of the ""real"" world. What does it take to get a new emoji on the phone's keyboard? Take a look at the campaign for a new white wine emoji. Why is the LGBTQI rainbow flag emoji in the keyboards, but not the one that stands for transgender people? Where lies the power to make such decisions? -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
