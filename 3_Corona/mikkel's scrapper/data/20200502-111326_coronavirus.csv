Being offline is the new luxury - VPRO documentary,News & Politics,66528,"1,137",43,"When have you been offline for the last time? Did you choose yourself to be offline or was internet not working? To be offline seems more and more to become a choice that we see as a luxury. Is being offline the new luxury or is it still a luxury to be online for some people?Digital networks are becoming denser and denser. We are online all the time everywhere and they are fewer places where we really can be alone. Where and when can we still disconnect? To be offline has become a luxury. Will we permanently use data or do we take back control over our connectivity? In this documentary we go on a journey to the edge of internet. To be online all the time and everywhere. It sounds great, but it has its drawbacks. As digital networks are closing in, there are fewer places to be really on your own. Being offline is becoming a luxury. Where can you be offline? We are connected to the internet even in our bedrooms. It‚Äôs the ambition of companies like Google and Facebook to connect the entire world, so that we can be online all the time and everywhere. Google has sent balloons up into the skies over Sri Lanka to provide the island state with free Wi-Fi for a month. On the ground, more and more devices communicate through the so-called Internet-of-Things. We are going to be ‚Äòglass citizens‚Äô in a transparent house, connected for life to a wireless intravenous drip and traced anywhere via our smartphones. What does it mean? A small but growing group of people is saying goodbye to lifetime connectability. They are researching ways to keep control. What can we learn from them about life in the digital era?

Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4368110,"47,009","3,186","Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it‚Äôs known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

‚ÄúIt Shattered My Life‚Äù: Former Joe Biden Staffer Tara Reade Says He Sexually Assaulted Her in 1993,News & Politics,371469,"9,739",885,"In an exclusive Democracy Now! TV/radio broadcast, we speak with Tara Reade, the former staffer in Joe Biden‚Äôs Senate office who has come forward with allegations that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993. Last week, The Intercept reported that the Time‚Äôs Up Legal Defense Fund, set up to help survivors of rape and sexual assault, refused to fund a #MeToo investigation into allegations against Biden. Reade told journalist Katie Halper in an interview published Tuesday that Biden repeatedly touched her without her consent and sexually assaulted her. Reade approached the Time‚Äôs Up Legal Defense Fund in January looking for assistance, but was reportedly told the fund could not help her because Biden is a candidate for federal office, and pursuing a case could jeopardize the fund‚Äôs nonprofit status. Reade says she learned from The Intercept report that the public relations firm representing Time‚Äôs Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker, whose managing director, Anita Dunn, is top adviser to Biden‚Äôs presidential campaign.#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

We are building a way of life here on the farm and an income (eventually) to get me out of the corporate world and into the outdoors raising crops, animals and eventually children in a peaceful loving environment.


We are a nearly 200 acre farm nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  Most of my videos are practical videos of things that need to be done around a small farm to keep equipment and the farm up and running.
 
We purchased this tract of land as an old grown up washed out gullied tobacco farm, and are rehabilitating fields with minimal fertilizer and lots of hard work.

These ""how to"" and Vlog type videos are meant to be informative and entertaining tidbits of farm life here on the Stoney Ridge.

I hope you enjoy our videos, please subscribe to our page and Ill teach you everything I can about starting a farm from scratch.",58564330,0,381000,False,717

The so-called Spanish Lady caused somewhere between 25 and 100 million deaths worldwide. It is distinctive both for its high mortality rate, in comparison to other flu pandemics, and for its unusual demographic effect: whereas the flu typically targets the very young and old, the 1918-1920 epidemic struck adults in the prime of life.

The dynasty ended with the brutal assassination of the last Tsar, Nicholas II and his family by the Bolsheviks in Ekaterinburg in 1917.The Romanov dynasty played a hugely important role in world history, and the series highlights the life stories and characters of the tsars, recounting their rise to power and their contribution to the dynasty, their merits and their faults, their achievements and mistakes, their victories and defeats in war.The series also examines the Russian form of 'Caesarism' as a system of state administration - its advantages and drawbacks and how the Russian state changed under the Romanov's rule.THE ROMANOVS is told in eight epic one-hour episodes using a unique combination of magnificent CGI animation and dramatic reconstruction with careful and accurate attention paid to each period.Type: TV seriesGenre: docudramaYear of production: 2013Duration: 8x52 minutesDirected by: Maksim BespalyiWritten by: Marina Bandilenko, Marina UlybyshevaDirector of photography: Ivan BarkhvartProducers: Valeriy Babich, Vlad Ryashin, Sergey Titinkov, Konstantin ErnstWatch movies and TV series for free in high quality.Explore a great collection of documentaries.The best Russian movies and tv series, melodrama, war movies, military tv shows, new russian films, top documentary films and full movies with english subtitle.With these free online Russian language movies you will learn Russian easily.Subscribe for high quality movies and series on our channel.Enjoy Watching!#StarMediaEN",PT206M59S,2018-10-12,2018-10-12,211412,StarMediaEN,/channel/UCuSx-lf2ft7hPceGVNHybOw,UCuSx-lf2ft7hPceGVNHybOw,19,46DEVQ8UacA,"Watch movies and TV series for free in high quality.

Having sold over 100 million albums worldwide, he is regarded as one of the best selling artists in the world and has been previously ranked as the best selling artist of the 2000's.  Eminem burst on to the US charts in 1999 with a controversial take on the hip hop subgenre, horrorcore.

While offending an array of individuals and various other artists named in his album lead him to become one of the biggest starts on the planet.  Eminem isn't just about controversy and shock value.

Mark Cuban is the total opposite. The owner of the Dallas Mavericks is known for criticizing referees and presidents alike. His business chops go back to the 1990s, when Cuban co-founded an online streaming company that he sold to Yahoo for $5.7 billion. He has since invested in dozens of startups and continues to do so as a host of the show ""Shark Tank."" Cuban is here to talk about how to pick the right investments, ignoring everybody else's noise, and maybe generating some of your own.Hello, everyone, I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to ""Influencers,"" and welcome to our guest Mark Cuban. Mark, great to see you.MARK CUBAN: Thanks for having me.ANDY SERWER: Mark, of course, entrepreneur, star of ""Shark Tank,"" owner of the Dallas Mavericks. And, in fact, he's hosting us here today. We're at Dallas Mavericks headquarters here across the street.MARK CUBAN: Yep. Right across from the arena.ANDY SERWER: From the arena, right. So, a whole bunch of stuff to talk to you about.MARK CUBAN: Fire away.ANDY SERWER: But let's talk about this president thing that's out there. There are people who suggest that you should run for president, maybe you have aspirations. I don't know, but it's a discussion point. So what would it take to have you run for president?MARK CUBAN: I'm excited about next year for the Mavs. It's going to be a great season.ANDY SERWER: Come on, man.MARK CUBAN: I don't even want to get into it. I mean, I did one quick interview, and then all of a sudden it blew up. I don't want to feed the beast. Like I said, there is a certain set of circumstances that would push me to do it, but we're not there yet. So if and when it happens, you'll be the first to know, Andy.ANDY SERWER: OK. That's very cool. What about the Democratic field? Is there anyone there that you think can challenge President Trump?MARK CUBAN: Well, I mean, there's now and then there's November of 2020. I mean, if the election were held today, I think Trump would win. I don't think that there's somebody that has the momentum or just the value of the incumbency that Trump has. But, at the same time, between now and then, I think Joe Biden has got a good chance. And we'll see what happens with any of the other of the field of 97 to see if anybody emerges or if anybody new comes in.I think Biden is capable of beating him, but we're not there yet.ANDY SERWER: You've been critical of President Trump before. Have you kind of made any peace with him? I mean, you know, it's been a couple of years.MARK CUBAN: I get along with him. I mean, you know, we didn't have to make peace. You know, like any president, I agree with some things and disagree with other things. It's not personal. There's things I would do differently, and but it was the same with Obama, it was the same with Bush, it was the same with Clinton. That's just the nature of the beast.ANDY SERWER: So have you talked to him and given him any advice? Or what advice would you give him?MARK CUBAN: I mean, I'm not a fan of the tariffs. I understand what he's trying to do in terms of battling China. I would approach it differently, because I think tariffs are attacks on the American people. But, at the same time, I think we have a variety of other leverage points. I'll give you the perfect example. Chinese companies on American-- Chinese companies listed on American exchanges have a market cap of more than $1.4 trillion. That's a lot of leverage right there. They're raising money via IPOs-- something we can't do in China. I'd shut down all Chinese IPOs.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/influe...Subscribe to Yahoo Finance: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbAbout Yahoo Finance: At Yahoo Finance, you get free stock quotes, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, international market data, social interaction and mortgage rates that help you manage your financial life.Connect with Yahoo Finance:Get the latest news: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbFind Yahoo Finance on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2A9u5ZqFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2LMgloPFollow Yahoo Finance on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LOpNYz",PT41M32S,2019-05-23,2019-05-23,343231,Yahoo Finance,/channel/UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,20,353ToPWTgjI,"Yahoo Finance is the largest business and financial news site in the world, with unrivaled access to data, insights, and content.

Answers to some common questions:

1) I studied Mechanical Engineering in School.  I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.
2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  I founded a company called Digital Dudz on my nights and weekends while working at NASA (also made some videos about that) and sold it to the guys who make Morphsuits in the UK.  As part of the sale I quit my job at NASA and worked for them coming up with all their new costume ideas for 2 years.  Recently, I was presented with an opportunity to return to my Engineering roots to come do some ideation type of work for a tech company near San Francisco.

Dr. Jason Fung: Fasting as a Therapeutic Option for Weight Loss,Sports,921622,"13,335",405,"Dr. Jason Fung, MD, is a nephrologist and expert in the use of intermittent fasting and low-carbohydrate diets for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. In this presentation, delivered on Aug. 2, 2018, at the 2018 CrossFit Health Conference in Madison, Wisconsin, Fung shares his first-hand experiences with ‚ÄúThe Mess‚Äù and discusses how he shifted his research and medical practices as a result of those experiences.Fung‚Äôs objectives for his presentation include:1. Understanding why long-term weight loss is so difficult.2. Introducing the concept of therapeutic fasting.3. Understanding some myths and misunderstandings associated with the fasting process.He recalls treating obese and diabetic patients with traditional methods, which included what he characterizes as poor dietary recommendations and a slurry of drugs. He explains, ‚ÄúIt became obvious that I‚Äôm just sort of holding their hand until they get their heart attack, until they get dialysis, until they go blind, until we chop their feet off.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really sad to realize that the profession that you‚Äôve chosen is not really helping people,‚Äù he says. This realization compelled him to diagnose the problems associated with traditional care and seek alternative treatment methods for his patients.Fung historicizes what he calls ‚Äúthe modern eating pattern,‚Äù which emerged in 1977 in the U.S. with the development of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. He notes the 1977 guidelines led to the consumption of more grains and sugars, which in turn led to people ‚Äúeating often, eating late, and eating all the time.‚Äù Incidences of obesity and Type 2 diabetes reached epidemic levels, and the most common treatments long have been drug interventions. Unfortunately, the prevailing non-pharmaceutical prescription ‚Äî to eat less and move more ‚Äî has a 99.9% failure rate. Fung observes that popular wisdom tells us to blame the patient and assume he or she did not adhere to the prescription. He claims a basic understanding of metabolism suggests otherwise, however.Fung explains why a significant reduction in caloric intake leads to a decrease in basal metabolism. This biological inevitability is ignored by the proponents of the ‚Äúcalories in, calories out‚Äù fallacy, he observes.He also explains why intermittent fasting is an effective alternative to traditional treatments for obesity and diabetes. The modern eating pattern keeps our insulin levels high all the time as we eat over long durations, and when insulin remains high all the time, Fung explains, our bodies store food energy as fat, and we remain hungry. Intermittent fasting, on the other hand, allows insulin levels to drop, which puts us in burning mode rather than storing mode.Fung claims his recommendations are so effective that patients no longer need to say, ‚ÄúOh wow, I have to go see my doctor to see what pill I need,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI need to go see my doctor to see if he needs to stick a stent in me.‚Äù Instead, Fung explains, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre giving you the power to take back your own health, because you‚Äôre not gonna get it from anywhere else.‚ÄùCrossFit¬Æ - Forging Elite Fitness¬Æ (https://www.crossfit.com/)",PT71M28S,2019-07-27,2019-07-27,341411,CrossFit¬Æ,/channel/UCtcQ6TPwXAYgZ1Mcl3M1vng,UCtcQ6TPwXAYgZ1Mcl3M1vng,20,7nJgHBbEgsE,"CrossFit¬Æ is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide.

Running premium or midgrade in a car designed to run regular is a waste of money and has no HP or MPG benefits. You will not make more power or get better fuel economy running premium fuel if the car manufacturer tunes the car to use regular gas in most cases.

Turning toxic ‚Äî the Bayer-Monsanto merger | DW Documentary,Education,333015,"4,329",182,"A year after Germany‚Äôs Bayer Group took over  Monsanto, and it‚Äôs struggling to deal with the US seed giant‚Äôs controversial reputation. Now Bayer is also liable for Monsanto‚Äôs legal bills - which are starting to mount alarmingly.Roundup, a herbicide containing glyphosate sold worldwide by Monsanto has long been suspected of causing cancer. A California court has just awarded more than $2 billion in damages to a couple who had claimed that their use of the pesticide caused them to develop non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma . Bayer‚Äôs share price halved last year, and the consequences are already making themselves felt in the company itself: Around 12,000 jobs worldwide are to be cut in the next few years, a considerable proportion of them in Germany. CEO Werner Baumann, who pushed for the merger, is coming under increasing pressure. Voicing criticism, a majority of shareholders voted against absolving Baumann and other managers of their responsibility in the merger. Bayer is in the midst of its greatest crisis.The film traces the effects of the merger and investigates potential new health hazards emanating from glyphosate. How has Monsanto tried in the past to influence politicians, scientists and public opinion? Did the Americans actually play down or ignore the dangers? And does Bayer really distance itself from these practices?--------------------------------------------------------------------Subscribe to DW Documentary:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39...Our other YouTube channels:DW Documental (in spanish): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocumentalDW Documentary Ÿàÿ´ÿßÿ¶ŸÇŸäÿ© ÿØŸä ÿØÿ®ŸÑŸäŸà: (in arabic): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocarabiaFor more documentaries visit also:http://www.dw.com/en/tv/docfilm/s-3610Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/dwdocumentary/Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/dw.storiesDW netiquette policy: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G",PT42M26S,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,112234,DW Documentary,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,20,EwllBdC0Iww,"DW Documentary gives you information beyond the headlines.

Local sex worker Anitha invites us for lunch in her brothel; shows us her homemade ""sex rooms,"" and tells us what it's like to be a religious prostitute in modern India. Afterwards we cross the border into Karnataka into the heartlands of the ancient Devadasi tradition to uncover the mystery of the Goddess Yellamma, and find out how a religious icon became a justification for child prostitution. We meet two teenage Devadasis, Mala and Belavva, to talk sex, saris, and how they cope with the deadly threat of HIV.A dancing transvestite Devadasi steals the limelight in the next phase of our journey, as we travel deeper into the murky world of temple prostitution. He invites us for chai, gives our host a manicure, and teaches us a few tricks of the trade. We explore the home of the most celebrated Devadasi brothel madam in the business to find out how she lures the next generation of girls into the sex trade.For the grand finale we went to the annual full moon festival in Saundatti, the most prestigious event in the Devadasi calendar. The colour, dancing and celebrations of the festival disguise the darkness of its underlying purpose: child sex trafficking. Here traffickers, pimps and brothel madams come from all over India to recruit young girls and boys into the sex trade in the name of the Goddess Yellamma.

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn‚Äôt the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed.

I received a BA in chemistry from Carleton College, and performed graduate studies in both synthetic organic chemistry and science education at Cal State Northridge, receiving an MA in the latter. Prior to this I taught for about a decade in various high school and undergraduate settings, specializing in organic chemistry but also teaching general chemistry, physics, and biology.

This channel is certainly for students in science courses at both the high school and undergraduate level, but it is also for members of the general public that just want to know a little more about the world and how things work.

Science Of The Soul  - Full Documentary,Film & Animation,2803365,"29,769","2,472","Do human beings have souls? From the beginning of human awareness ‚Äì no matter the context and no matter the age ‚Äì the answer was always ‚Äúyes‚Äù. All cultures have universally argued that human beings are ‚Äúensouled‚Äù. About a hundred years ago, however, scientists decided that the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù is not a proper subject of scientific investigation ‚Äì consciousness replaced soul. Then, the brain replaced consciousness. Lately, this perspective has led some scientists to argue that within 20-30 years AI, robotics and biological brains will converge to create a cyborg/Matrix like reality where there is, essentially, no difference between humans and machines. Science of the Soul is a feature length documentary investigation into these life and death issues. From robotics to near death experiences, from attempts to achieve altered states of consciousness in the jungles of Peru to an exploration of infant state of mind, Science of the Soul explores the cutting-edge of consciousness related science to determine whether we are about to experience a new step in human evolution or the death of the human soul.üéû üçøüé•üìΩüé¨ Watch more free documentaries on Syndicado TV - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP5vk...üìº Syndicado TV is where you‚Äôll find an eclectic mix of mind-bending documentaries, cult classic films and investigative television documentaries. https://youtube.com/syndicadotvDiscover our other channels with free movies and tv series:‚ñ∂Ô∏è I Love Docs for documentaries: https://youtube.com/ILOVEDOCS‚ñ∂Ô∏è North of Main for Independent movies: https://youtube.com/NORTHOFMAIN‚ñ∂Ô∏è Syndicado Reality: https://youtube.com/SYNDICADOREALITY#syndicadotv #science #documentary",PT87M25S,2019-03-29,2019-03-29,241214,Syndicado TV,/channel/UCuLhRj43ZJzQV-5_im_BwQA,UCuLhRj43ZJzQV-5_im_BwQA,20,S7SQoQj9868,"An eclectic mix of reality TV, mind-bending documentaries, cult classic films, and upcoming clips and trailers!",46221930,0,161000,False,1510

The Dangers of Whitewashing Black History | David Ikard | TEDxNashville,Nonprofits & Activism,727390,"22,869","1,370","Should white people care about the whitewashing of black history? Most people will likely answer yes to this question, if only because it sounds politically correct to do so. What will hopefully become clear is that whites have as much to lose by whitewashing black history as their African American peers. David Ikard is a Professor of African American and Diaspora Studies at Vanderbilt University. His research and teaching interests include African American Literature, black feminist criticism, hip-hop culture, black masculinity and whiteness studies. He is the author/co-author of four books, including ""Breaking The Silence: Toward a Black Male Feminist Criticism"" (2007), ""Nation of Cowards: Black Activism in Barack Obama's Post-Racial America"" (2012; co-authored with Martell Teasley and winner of the 2013 Best Scholarly Book Award by DISA), ""Blinded by the Whites: Why Race Still Matters in 21st-Century America"" (2013), and ""Lovable Racists, Magical Negroes, and White Messiahs"" (2017).

Please rate and leave a comment for us! (ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°)Sign up to our newsletter for web series updates: http://eepurl.com/bLFBXPMeet Michael Greenfield, a musician who began tuning, repairing, restoring, and making guitars in the 70s and since then has become a seasoned luthier of bespoke guitars. Having experience with vintage and antique guitar repair and restoration, he brings a unique insight to his craft, creating personalized musical instruments and functional works of art for artists, collectors and those who deserve the very best. His workshop is based in Montreal, where we visited over a period of 5 months, filming as he and his apprentice, Julien, transformed slices of spruce, ebony, mahogany, and other tree species into glistening guitars. It was all of our collective vision to present the process in the most candid, down-to-earth fashion, so in this hour-long documentary you will see all the glue, smudges, shavings, dust, and callouses. His guitars feature Florentine cutaways with spalted beech rosettes, violin-style body purflings and simple decorative purflings along edges, Laskin style arm rests and rib rests, amongst other features. This documentary follows several different steel-string guitars from beginning to finish. As Michael puts it, the guitar still thinks it‚Äôs a tree until it receives its first set of strings and that is when the instrument is born. After many months of work, the magical moment when we hear a guitar‚Äôs first notes is like hearing a child‚Äôs first words.

Fauci had been sought as a witness for a House Appropriations Committee subcommittee that was looking into the U.S. response to the pandemic, according to Evan Hollander, a committee spokesman. ‚ÄúWe have been informed by an administration official that the White House has blocked Dr. Fauci from testifying,‚Äù Hollander said on Friday afternoon. The White House later confirmed that Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, would not be appearing.Gilead Sciences Inc.‚Äôs antiviral drug remdesivir was cleared by U.S. regulators for emergency use in Covid-19 patients, becoming the first medication backed by early clinical data to be made available to fight the novel coronavirus. Remdesivir reduced the time it took hospitalized Covid-19 patients to recover in an interim analysis of an ongoing study. The Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency-use authorization, President Donald Trump said on Friday, a step by which the agency can allow products to be used without full data on their safety and efficacy. Gilead shares closed down 4.8% on Friday at $79.95 in New York. The company has faced questions from investors about how it plans to make money on the drug, but its stock is still up 23% this year, at a time when the rest of the market has cratered. ‚ÄúThis was lighting speed in terms of getting something approved,‚Äù said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking with Trump. ‚ÄúFrom clinical trial to getting it authorized, it was 90 days.‚ÄùSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.",PT0M0S,2020-05-01,2020-05-01,34344,Washington D.

Thomas Sowell on the Myths of Economic Inequality,News & Politics,1118520,"26,770",867,"Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master‚Äôs at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell‚Äôs first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell‚Äôs written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

War in the Central African Republic (Full Length),News & Politics,2773789,"18,254",955,"Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-NewsThe Central African Republic's capital of Bangui has seen its Muslim population drop from 130,000 to under 1000 over the past few months. Over the past year, thousands across CAR have been killed and nearly a million have been displaced. The United Nations recently stated that the entire Western half of the country has now been cleansed of Muslims.CAR has never fully recovered from France's colonial rule, and it has only known ten years of a civilian government - from 1993 to 2003 - since achieving independence in 1960. Coup after coup, often with French military involvement, has led many to refer to the country as a phantom state. The current conflict has now completely erased the rule of law and order, and left the UN and international community looking confused and impotent. In March 2013, the S√©l√©ka, a mostly Muslim rebel alliance, rose up and overthrew the corrupt government of Fran√ßois Boziz√©, while bringing terror and chaos across the country - pillaging, killing and raping with impunity. In response, mostly Christian self-defense forces, called the anti-balaka, formed to defend CAR against S√©l√©ka attacks.Clashes grew more frequent throughout 2013 as the S√©l√©ka grew more ruthless. In December 2013, French and African troops went in to disarm the S√©l√©ka and staunch the bloodshed. The anti-balaka, seizing on a weakened S√©l√©ka, then went on the offensive.CAR had no real history of religious violence, and the current conflict is not based on any religious ideology. The fighting, however, turned increasingly sectarian in the fall of 2013, with revenge killings becoming the norm. And as the S√©l√©ka's power waned, the anti-balaka fed their need for revenge by brutalizing Muslim civilians.  ""Too few peacekeepers were deployed too late; the challenge of disarming the S√©l√©ka, containing the anti-balaka, and protecting the Muslim minority was underestimated,"" Human Rights Watch said in a recent statement. The bloodshed has not stopped. The UN is still debating whether or not to send peacekeepers. Even if a peacekeeping operation is approved, it will take six months for troops to be assembled.

Mac Donald also breaks down issues of gender and racial equality.

Then dredge them in plain all purposeflour and let then set for 30 minutes so the flour will stick tothe onion rings. Now make a batter!The batter consists of:1 cup of all purpose flour 1/4 cup of corn starch, 1 tsp. paprika,1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp. white pepper.and about 1 cup of very cold beer. Add slowly until you get a batter like pancake batter, maybe a hair thinner. Heat your oil to 350 degrees and take the flour coated onion rings(using a chop stick or wooden skewer) and dip them into the batter, (let them soak in the batter until the batter sticks to the flour already on the onion rings.)Drop them in the oil and cook until nice and golden brown.They cook really nice. I find it is hard to over cook them.Remove and place them on a bed of paper towels.

But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world‚Äôs last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies.

He provides an overview of the many reasons why viruses might be considered the most biologically successful inhabitants of earth, including their ability to rapidly reproduce, and adapt to environmental challenges. Turner explains how viruses have impacted human history, as well as earth‚Äôs history, due to their prevalent interactions with other species.Viruses have an incredible capacity to adapt to environmental challenges, but sometimes, the environment constraints viral adaptation. Turner‚Äôs laboratory uses experimental evolution to study how viruses adapt to environmental changes (e.g. temperature changes), and the mechanisms by which viruses jump to novel host species. Turner‚Äôs work suggests that viruses with greater capacities to block the innate immune systems of their hosts, also have a greater likelihood of emerging on new host species. Also, he describes how virus adaptation to environmental change may be constraints by trade-offs: viruses can evolve either greater reproduction or greater survival, but not both simultaneously.Before antibiotics were discovered, scientists were using viruses of bacteria, bacteriophages, to treat bacterial infections in humans. Given the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, scientists are revisiting the idea of using phage therapy to treat infections. In his third lecture, Turner provides an introduction to phage therapy, and how it can be improved by applying ‚Äòevolution thinking‚Äô. His laboratory discovered phage OMKO1 that can treat multi-drug resistant bacteria in human patients while causing these bacteria to evolve greater sensitivity to antibiotics.Speaker Biography:Dr. Paul Turner is Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, and holds an appointment in the Microbiology Program at Yale School of Medicine. His laboratory studies how viruses evolutionarily adapt to overcome environmental challenges, such as temperature changes or infection of novel host species. Turner received his bachelor‚Äôs degree in Biology from the University of Rochester in 1988, and completed his graduate studies in microbial ecology and evolution at Michigan State University in 1995.

Ebola Survivor - Dr. Ian Crozier,Education,324288,,,"Dr. Ian Crozier contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone while treating Ebola patients in the government hospital in Kenema as a volunteer for the World health Organization. He was evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Sept. 9, 2014, the third American with Ebola to be airlifted there from West Africa. He spent an agonizing 40 days in the hospital before finally recovering.  Less than two months later, he developed soaring pressure in his left eye, with nausea and headaches. Test results were completely unexpected: the inside of his left eye was teeming with Ebola.  Dr. Crozier, who also suffers from hearing loss, joint and muscle pain, disabling fatigue, problems with memory loss and word-finding, calls himself a poster child for ‚Äúpost-Ebola syndrome‚Äù.

China: Truth In A Pandemic | 101 East,News & Politics,100177,870,108,"It is frightening and deadly - and now it has gone global.The COVID-19 pandemic is claiming lives around the world, terrifying populations, forcing entire countries into lockdown.But back when it all began, what really went on in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak?With people desperate for information, 101 East investigates the cover-ups and missteps by Chinese authorities that have sparked criticism of the government rarely seen in China.Government announcements and Chinese state media downplayed the spread of the virus, but citizen journalists hit the ground to expose the reality. However, they incurred the wrath of authorities and have since disappeared.A journalist, hiding his identity for fear of reprisal, tells 101 East that, if the media were allowed to investigate and report on the virus, it might not have reached its pandemic level.Now that state media and local authorities have admitted to problems in releasing information about the virus, it seems like too little, too late for some.In Hong Kong, the memory of the deadly 2003 SARS virus is still fresh in the minds of doctors like Alfred Wong. He says those who have been speaking the truth have given their lives while doing so, and the suppression of China's whistleblowers should be seen as a crime.""If China was an open, transparent, democratic nation, then this whole thing might not happen in the first place,"" he says.101 East investigates the fight for truth in a time of contagion.

How Elon Musk Took Tesla To Hell And Back With The Model 3,News & Politics,990887,"13,579","1,805","In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called Tesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would transform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would want‚Äî affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. In 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.Over the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit. Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a ‚Äúhell of a ride,‚Äù and he took Wall Street along with him.

Victor Davis Hanson on ‚ÄúThe Case For Trump‚Äù,News & Politics,2393367,"28,030","2,041","Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonal authenticity‚Äù during the campaign and how the media has a ‚Äúhistorical amnesia‚Äù of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump‚Äôs platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn‚Äôt appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California‚Äôs Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that‚Äôs drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to ""Influencers.""

And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day.

And you were talking a lot about--CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.ANDY SERWER: Right.CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word ""common sense,"" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.For more of this transcript click;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/influe...Subscribe to Yahoo Finance: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbAbout Yahoo Finance: At Yahoo Finance, you get free stock quotes, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, international market data, social interaction and mortgage rates that help you manage your financial life.Connect with Yahoo Finance:Get the latest news: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbFind Yahoo Finance on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2A9u5ZqFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2LMgloPFollow Yahoo Finance on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LOpNYz",PT41M42S,2019-05-09,2019-05-09,112214,Yahoo Finance,/channel/UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,20,RFxXl9eAWV4,"Yahoo Finance is the largest business and financial news site in the world, with unrivaled access to data, insights, and content.

Small mammals are expert diggers.

The History of Japan Documentary,Education,1425669,"4,180",592,"The history of Japan covers Japan and its relation to the world. It is characterized by isolationist, semi-open and expansionist periods.The very first human habitation in the Japanese archipelago has been traced to prehistoric times around 30,000 BCE. The J≈çmon period, named after its ""cord-marked"" pottery, was followed by the Yayoi in the first millennium BC when new technologies were introduced from continental Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese Book of Han in the first century AD. Between the fourth century and the ninth century, Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the Emperor. This imperial dynasty continues to reign over Japan. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at Heian-ky≈ç (modern Kyoto), marking the beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until 1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture. Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native Shinto practices and Buddhism.Over the following centuries, the power of the Emperor and the imperial court gradually declined, passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats ‚Äì most notably the Fujiwara ‚Äì and then to the military clans and their armies of samurai. The Minamoto clan under Minamoto no Yoritomo emerged victorious from the Genpei War of 1180‚Äì85, defeating their rival military clan, the Taira. After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in Kamakura and took the title of sh≈çgun. In 1274 and 1281, the Kamakura shogunate withstood two Mongol invasions, but in 1333 it was toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the Muromachi period. During the Muromachi period regional warlords called daimy≈çs grew in power at the expense of the sh≈çgun. Eventually, Japan descended into a period of civil war. Over the course of the late sixteenth century, Japan was reunified under the leadership of the prominent daimy≈ç Oda Nobunaga and his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu came to power and was appointed sh≈çgun by the Emperor. The Tokugawa shogunate, which governed from Edo (modern Tokyo), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the Edo period (1600‚Äì1868). The Tokugawa shogunate imposed a strict class system on Japanese society and cut off almost all contact with the outside world.This video is made for educational purposes only.COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER UNDER SECTION 107 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT 1976Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for ""fair use"" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Inside the investigation: Why Gerard Baden-Clay murdered his wife Allison | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,1760054,"9,918","1,548","Gerard Baden-Clay tried to portray himself as 'Mr Middle Class' - a successful small-businessman, proud father and loving and devoted husband. But the real Gerard was the complete opposite. He was an incompetent real estate agent whose business was hemorrhaging money; he was intolerant with his three young daughters and he was a womaniser who wasn't even faithful to his long-term mistress. But why Gerard Baden-Clay thought all his problems could be fixed by killing his beautiful wife Allison, only he knows. So far he's not saying, but after being convicted of murder, he now has a lifetime in prison to think about it.

Resonance takes a deeper look at how humanity is reacting to the most profound environmental change the planet has ever seen. Two billion years ago life first appeared on earth, a planet bathed in a natural electromagnetic frequency. As life slowly evolved from simple to complex organisms, it did so surrounded by this frequency, forming a harmonic relationship with it, a relationship that science is just beginning to comprehend. New research is showing that exposure to this frequency is vital to human beings. It controls our mental and physical health, it synchronizes our circadian rhythms, it aids our immune system, and it improves our overall sense of well-being. Not only are we surrounded by natural frequencies, our bodies are suffused with them. Our cells communicate using electromagnetic frequencies. Our brain emits a constant stream of frequencies and our DNA delivers instructions using frequency waves.

North Korea - All the dictator's men | DW Documentary,Education,5571391,"38,626","3,118","North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim‚Äôs treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers.

Nepal's slave girls | 101 East,Entertainment,277684,"1,839",104,"Slavery is banned in Nepal. But hidden behind the walls of city homes, some still keep young girls as slaves called kamlaris.The girls are from the Tharu community, an indigenous group that was stripped of its land and forced into bonded labour after Nepal's first social order was introduced 160 years ago. Tharus farm the land of their landlord and, in return, give back half of what they produce. Often, they trade away their daughters as well.In June 2013, kamlaris from all over the country protested in a bid to bring an end to slavery once and for all. They want to be free from servitude and have their basic rights guaranteed. The demonstrations were triggered by the mysterious death of Srijana, a 12-year-old kamlari girl who burnt to death in her owner's house. The police alleged it was suicide but the kamlaris were not convinced.The police retaliated against the demonstrators with violence. Political organisations and rights groups were conspicuously absent from their demonstrations. 101 East travels to western Nepal, home of the Tharus, where Srijana's mother, Draupati Chaudhary, is still in shock. Draupati had handed over her daughter in exchange for the right to till the land and the promise that Srijana would receive an education. Two years on, Srijana was dead.In a nearby village, another kamlari, Sharda Chaudhary, talks about how she was abused. She slept in the bathroom and was raped by the landlord's son. When she dared to complain, she was beaten up. Sharda worked for only three months. When she was sent back, her mother did not believe that she would survive.While the government declared the practice illegal more than 10 years ago, many kamlaris continue to live lives of hardship and suffering. In the last five years, five kamlaris have died under mysterious circumstances while 27 are missing from the homes they worked in.We speak to the official spokesperson of the ministry for women and children and ask what the government is doing regarding these grave abuses.We also meet some who are working to change the fate of kamlari girls. Man Bahadur Chettri and his organisation, Indentured Daughter's Programme, have rescued more than 12,000 kamlaris. For many of the girls, trauma and emotional baggage makes it hard for them to return home and reintegrate into society, so they end up at a hostel. Here, they receive education, food and shelter until they are able to support themselves.Other former kamlaris have joined forces with NGOs to create awareness among parents who might otherwise send their daughters away. They also take on the more active role of rescuers, in a bid to end the kamlari system by freeing one girl at a time.During our filming, we see young girls working behind the high walls of many city homes and ask one man why he continues to keep a kamlari. He tells us that he provides her with education, food and a good place to stay, treating her like his own daughter.We follow a mother on her journey to free her daughter. In the process, we realise that there are many grey areas when it comes to kamlaris and that what is good for most, is not necessarily good for all.More from 101 East on:YouTube - http://aje.io/101eastYouTubeFacebook - http://facebook.com/101east Twitter - http://twitter.com/aj101east Instagram - http://instagram.com/aj101east Website - http://aljazeera.com/101east#AlJazeeraEnglish #Nepal #SlaveGirls",PT25M31S,2014-08-01,2014-08-01,222414,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,lD_9aI0MLoo,"#AlJazeeraEnglish, we focus on people and events that affect people's lives.

She has a Bachelor of Education with a multidisciplinary background in teaching, psychology, organizational development, HR Training, and research.Let‚Äôs break this down and look at the Narcissist a bit more closely.1.  The Narcissist lacks life energy.In other words, a Narcissist is dependent on other people for a form of energy that they have (and can give) but the Narcissist lacks.  Thus, the Narcissist needs one or more human targets as sources of supply.Without this energetic ‚Äúsupply,‚Äù the Narcissist experiences such emotions as boredom, irritability, panic, and/or rage.  These resemble withdrawal symptoms, so it seems that Narcissists depend on energy received from other people.What is this energy?It isn‚Äôt electricity.  It isn‚Äôt food or nutrition.  It isn‚Äôt sunlight or microwaves or gravitation.  ‚ÄúNarcissistic supply‚Äù is another form of energy, one which can be exchanged between people and used in the process of human living.  It can also be used up, hence the Narcissist‚Äôs continual demands for it.I call it ‚Äúlife energy‚Äù.2.  Life energy is ‚Äúsoul‚Äù.Non-Narcissists don‚Äôt require this energy from others because we produce it within ourselves and use it for ourselves, sort of like having rechargeable batteries.  We use this ‚Äúlife energy‚Äù to live and thrive as human beings.  We also use the excess of it, beyond what we need for ourselves, as a sort of fuel to sustain our relationships.If we run low on life energy, we have to replenish it by resting or ‚Äúrecharging‚Äù in some way.  This is called ‚Äútaking care of you.‚Äù  We all need life energy just as we need food, and‚Äìalso like food‚Äìwe don‚Äôt have an unlimited supply of it.  (Just ask anyone who has raised children.)If we don‚Äôt have enough of this energy to give, our relationships suffer.  When we continually give life energy to a Narcissist (or anyone else) who continually demands it, the giving of it drains us.  Our supply becomes the Narcissist‚Äôs supply.  Eventually, our relationships and even our health can fail because our life energy, our vitality, is drained.This is how Narcissists weaken their targets, invisibly, from the inside out.What is this ‚Äúlife energy‚Äù that is not electricity or food; can take the form of time, attention, or effort; can be depleted in the process of sustaining human life, health, and relationships; and can be shared or exchanged with others?Basically, it‚Äôs emotional energy.Read the whole article on the blog:  https://kimsaeed.com/2016/09/06/what-...This presentation contains images that were used under a Creative Commons License.

"Drones, robots, and super sperm - the future of farming | DW Documentary (Farming documentary)",Education,224018,"2,234",116,"The future of farming: Driverless tractors, drones and robots. How is the agriculture industry changing as digital technology develops? Unmanned tractors controlled via GPS; drones that kill vermin in the fields from above; and highly efficient bull sperm used to produce genetically optimized calves. This is not science fiction. It‚Äôs the future of farming, today. ""Smart farming"" is the agricultural industry's new buzzword. A survey of almost 600 German farmers has revealed that more than one in two now uses digital solutions to optimize their harvests. Fierce regional and global competition, declining subsidies, higher standards of food quality, environmental protection, and increasing demand are forcing farmers to be highly efficient. This documentary looks at three examples of ""smart farming"" in Germany. Breeding consultant Johanna Schendel creates optimized dairy cows by selecting the right bull semen. Asparagus farmer Heiner Bartels uses a smartphone to calculate the optimum time to harvest. And drone pilot Bernd Meyer is out to fight pests in maize fields from the air. All three are trying to use modern technology to modify nature to fit the needs of our society. But where are the limits?_______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
