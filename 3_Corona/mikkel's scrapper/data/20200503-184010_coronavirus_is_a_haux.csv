DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2017-07-05,"Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market – the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? For years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: ""This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

This game went unpublished for over 50 years until Frank Brady unearthed Fischer's score sheet of it. Unlike the first game between Euwe and Fischer, this one was a closely contested fight which reached the final phase. Fischer had white, opening with the Ruy Lopez, and in reply Euwe selected an open system. Despite this open choice by Euwe, the game proceeded positionally, where imbalances in material and minor pieces soon surfaced. The game saw Fischer in the driver's seat at the early to mid-game stage, but the Euwe found a way to fight back some in the final phase. What resulted in the end, was a surprise.PGN:1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4 6.d4 b5 7.Bb3 d5 8.dxe5 Be6 9.c3 Be7 10.Nbd2 0-0 11.Qe2 Nc5 12.Nd4 Nxb3 13.N2xb3 Qd7 14.Nxc6 Qxc6 15.Be3 Qc4 16.Qd2 c5 17.Na5 Qh4 18.Nc6 Rfe8 19.g3 Qh5 20.Nxe7+ Rxe7 21.Bxc5 Rc7 22.Bd4 Bg4 23.f4 Rc6 24.a4 bxa4 25.Rxa4 Rh6 26.Qf2 Bf5 27.Rfa1 Rc8 28.Rb4 Rg6 29.Rb6 Rxb6 30.Bxb6 Qg4 31.Bd4 h5! 32.Rf1 Bd3 33.Re1 Rc6 34.Re3 Be4 35.Qe2 Qf5 36.Kf2 h4 37.Ke1 hxg3 38.hxg3 Rh6 39.Kd2 Bb1 40.Rf3 Rh1 41.Rf1Internet Chess Club (ICC)Software: Blitzinhttp://bit.ly/179O93NDiscount Code: CHESSNETWORKI'm a self-taught National Master in chess out of Pennsylvania, USA who was introduced to the game by my father in 1988 at the age of 8.

Carlsen opens with 1. d4 and Kasparov responds with a weird sideline of the Slav Defense on 6. ...Qa5 - most likely trying to take Carlsen out of his comfort zone and into an opening he had not studied extensively. Carlsen responds very logically with 7. Nd2 and 8. Qc2, calmly defending the important d4 square and breaking the pin on the c3 knight. With 9. ...e5!? Kasparov aims to immediately sharpen play, however Carlsen refuses to be baited into uncharted waters and calmly plays 10. 0-0. Kasparov's 11. ...Qb6 seems to be inaccurate as just 3 moves later he plays 14. ...Qc7 - making room for his d7 knight to maneuver to b6. Extreme complications ensue and Kasparov is forced to embark on a very awkward maneuver to avoid material loss, leading to a strong initiative for Carlsen after 23. Qc5 Rd8 24. d5! - introducing extreme pressure against Kasparov's badly coordinated and developed pieces. Carlsen's position looked nearly winning after 29. Rfe1, although after Kasparov 29. ...Bb7, it became apparent that if white played 30. Nxa5, black could sacrifice his bishop with 30. ...Bxg2 - leading to a very advantageous position for black. Instead of 29. Rfe1, Carlsen could have played 29. Bc7 which would led to a winning endgame for white as he would capture the a5 pawn and have 2 extra, connected passed pawns. However, after 29. Rfe1 Bb7 - Carlsen was forced to play 30. Nd4, essentially leading to a drawn endgame which Kasparov was easily able to hold - leading to a draw being agreed after 52.

To start, you’ll learn what constitutes a “pandemic.” Irwin tells us about the difference between “physical distancing” and “social distancing.” He explains why we want to be physically distant but remain socially together.

We investigate the importance of “contact tracing.” And, Irwin explains why we have to be careful when discussing “small” percentage changes.Discover more about the possibilities of a second and third wave of the outbreak. We explore why a rush back to open things is concerning. Irwin shares his thoughts on the death rate during the pandemic and why there might be severe undercounting. We also investigate statistics coming from other countries and if there’s any reason to not believe the reports. Lastly, we find out what the United States did wrong that lead to the mishandling of early preventative steps. We also explore what other countries have been doing right to flatten the curve.

DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2017-09-20,"Asia’s most beautiful railway line? The “Main Line” cuts through tea plantations and jungle, then passes Buddhist temples and relicts of the British Empire. In the 19th century the British built a railway in what was then their colony of Ceylon. Their idea was to transport goods such as tea from the highlands to the port of Colombo. Today it’s mainly only locals and tourists who use the so-called ""Main Line."" The route is considered one of the most picturesque in the whole of Asia.Our trip takes us from the capital, Colombo, to Ella in the highlands. Our first stop is one of the country’s largest elephant orphanages. And then on to Kandy, the former capital of the Singhalese kingdom. The city is home to the famous Temple of the Tooth, which is said to house the Buddha’s top left canine. The train then winds its way further up into the highlands. We watch tea pickers at work and go to a tea factory to discover where the aroma comes from. Nuwara Eliya is Sri Lanka’s highest town at an altitude of almost 1900 meters, where a racecourse still brings the colonial era back to life. The stations have also retained their own colonial charm: in 1901, a signaling system was set up to make the long journey safer. And those suffering from the altitude can catch their breath at the final stop, the spa in Ella._______ Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Through interviews filmed over four years, Chomsky unpacks the principles that have brought us to the crossroads of historically unprecedented inequality - tracing a half-century of policies designed to favor the most wealthy at the expense of the majority - while also looking back on his own life of activism and political participation. Profoundly personal and thought provoking, Chomsky provides penetrating insight into what may well be the lasting legacy of our time - the death of the middle class and swan song of functioning democracy. A potent reminder that power ultimately rests in the hands of the governed, REQUIEM is required viewing for all who maintain hope in a shared stake in the future.",963,PT72M50S,Movies,hZnuc-Fv_Tc,233,"13,143",20,Requiem for the American Dream,2019-11-15,435709,,327058092,0,271000,False,416

PBS NewsHour,UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,/channel/UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,2019-12-09,"Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, questioned Republican counsel Stephen Castor and Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman on Dec. 9. The questioning came on the second day of public hearings by the House Judiciary Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. In a tense moment, Collins urged Goldman to reveal who asked for phone numbers that were included in the impeachment report. “I’m going to go on record and tell you I’m not going to reveal how we conducted this investigation,” Goldman said. “And that’s the problem we have with this entire thing,” Collins said. When Goldman tried to interject, Collins said, “I’m done with you for right now.” The Judiciary and Intelligence committees have led the probe, hearing testimony from witnesses and legal experts about Trump’s conduct. House lawmakers are currently drafting the articles of impeachment, on which House lawmakers are anticipated to vote in the coming weeks. The impeachment case has revolved around a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics...Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSnapchat: @pbsnewsSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe",670,PT16M10S,News & Politics,JCpbg_ycAlU,813,"8,649",20,WATCH: Rep.

Even the World Health Organisation forecasts a world of pain. It says the virus poses a greater global threat than terrorism. That’s bad enough, but medical experts tell 60 MINUTES it’s actually even more terrifying. Professor Gabriel Leung, who led the fight against the SARS virus, believes 60 per cent of the world’s population could become infected with COVID-19 and that up to 45 million people might die from it. For this story, Liam Bartlett has travelled to Hong Kong and Thailand to find out the likely cause of the disease, as well as the latest ongoing efforts to combat it.

Today, chain restaurants tout food that's ""healthy,"" ""organic,"" and ""natural."" Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock explores this new reality with an approach even more immersive and subversive than that used for his first film: he sets out to open his own chicken franchise. We follow him every step of the way, from raising poultry and conjuring recipes to designing the brand and scouting a location. Spurlock brings his disarming humor to uncover the truths and lies behind this multibillion-dollar industry.Navigating a world of cynics and opportunists, Spurlock comes across like a hillbilly Jimmy Stewart with refreshing optimism. He confronts one challenge after another in his mission to live up to his ideals. The film feels especially timely when the US has a junk-food-loving President and an epidemic of false claims in advertising. Spurlock pays close attention to the Orwellian buzzwords that marketers use to bring a ""health halo"" to industrial food. While the original Super Size Me made a specific example of McDonald's, this compelling sequel focuses on new targets and doesn't hold back on naming names. The film builds momentum towards the day when Spurlock puts his reputation on the line by serving his first customers.","4,794",PT102M58S,Movies,dSyicDf9UvI,2331,"59,861",20,Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken,2020-02-27,2610875,,327058092,0,271000,False,416

It was deadly, devastating and attacked those who were promiscuous, well-heeled and well-travelled. But what was Syphilis and where had it come from? The traditional view has been that syphilis was part of ""the Columbian exchange"" – one of the things, along with tobacco and the potato, that the New World gave the Old. Arriving in Spain in the 1490s with Columbus and his crew, this destructive new plague spread quickly across Europe, leaving no country, no city, no royal household untouched. But what if this assumption is wrong? There is evidence of syphilis in skeletons dug from sites in France, Italy and England. Bones found in a medieval graveyard in Hull show signs of the ravages of syphilis. But if syphilis was present in Europe before Columbus went to America, why was the 1495 outbreak so deadly? And why did everyone see it as an entirely new plague?Use code 'timeline' and enjoy 3 months of History Hit for $3 http://bit.ly/TimelineWatchMoreContent licensed from DRG.From the original documentary, The Syphilis Enigma.Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com","3,294",PT48M49S,Education,2bWNF_eNwvI,8343,"26,715",20,The Syphilis Enigma (Medieval Disease Documentary) | Timeline,2017-08-07,3808054,"Welcome to Timeline - the home of world history.

It came down to himself, and a fit, 22 year old. He's lucky he learned how to build a firepit.It was safe enough to burn right in his shelter.And efficient enough to only need small twigs and sticks to keep burning. Saving him from having to expend energy by chopping down trees, and lugging in material.  Here’s what you’re going to learn in the video.First off you need to find an ideal location to buildIf you’re being tracked, and your survival hinges on not being detected. You need to build this fire in an ideal location.Next up you’ll learn a way to deconstruct your fire so nobody will know you were there. The key element to getting out of dodge quickly. You’ll see towards the end of this survival guide how it can quickly help you cover your tracks. Next you’ll learn how to properly position your holes, and how to dig them out while being discreet.Quick survival tip for when SHTF… You never know where you're going to need to set up camp in a survival situation and build your survival shelter. So always keep picking things up as you go.Also be conscious of roots when setting up this survival fire. Based on where you’re setting up…You most likely have a lot roots going through this as you build a firepit.You’ll also want to keep in mind to cut underneath your roots as you go.After you’re done this step, you’ll be ready to start building your fire hole. A key component in the dakota fire pit.If your shovel is too big, begin using a stick.You’ll eventually be connecting both the vent hole and fire hole. So the goal here is to keep digging until you get under the roots. Once you’ve done that, start tunneling to connect the two holes. Your main goal here is to maintain the integrity of the bridge between the two holes. If it’s sandy, it may be difficult. If it DOES happen to collapse on you. Don’t worry.You’ll learn how to fix that in the video. Make a new bridge out of sticks, and pack dirt down on it. Next up you’ll want to begin bundling your tinder so you can strike your fire in as little as one hit. You’ll want material like brooms edge, dog fennel and bow thistle.Of course, it’s ideal if you have a ferro rod. But if not, that’s fine. Using the bundle I’ve shown you, you can strike and be able to start a fire easily, every time. Once your bundle is alight, quickly position it over the fire pit. Hold it over your fire pit to let the flames catch your tinder bundle.Now, one of the things I love about this fire is how easy it is to keep going. Just a small handful of twigs and sticks as pictured above is more than enough. Due to the fact the fire is in a pit, it forces a lot of heat to come up in a focused area. Which is great for boiling water or cooking meat quickly.If you’re on the move, this is a great time to purify extra water you’ve gotten from a creek or lake.Once you’re done and ready to get back on the move. You’ll be undetectable to even the best trackers on the planet.

DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2020-05-02,"Thousands of soldiers were killed in the last battles of World War II. US troops who fought in the Hürtgen Forest nicknamed it the ""Death Factory."" This documentary features original film from US archives that bring the battle back to life.It's estimated that as many as 30 thousand US and German soldiers were killed in fighting in the northern Eifel region of Germany in the autumn and winter of 1944 and 1945. Traces of the battle - old bunkers, munitions, trenches and tank tracks - are still visible even today. The scarred landscape bears witness to a little-known chapter of World War Two. The ""Hürtgen Forest"" was the last obstacle standing between US forces and the Rhine River and Ruhr. Yet the decision to advance into the thick forest in September 1944 proved to be a fatal mistake. The Americans completely miscalculated North Eifel region's rugged terrain. They became disoriented in an area the German forces, the Wehrmacht, had crisscrossed with trenches and peppered with anti-personnel mines, making the wood into a veritable fortress. Continual rain and fog, followed by snow and frigid temperatures, turned the battle into a scene of dystopian butchery. Author Ernest Hemingway spent 18 days on the front in the Hürtgen Forest. He wrote later, ""It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there."" This documentary reconstructs the stages of the battle using commentary from survivors of the clash. Among them are the well-known US photographer Tony Vaccaro, US Army veteran James K. Cullen and former Wehrmacht soldier Paul Verbeek. In addition, Hürtgen Forest residents tell of the legacy of the battle, including the threat posed by countless unexploded munitions left in the ground 75 years after the conflict in Europe ended.",52,PT42M27S,Education,tT0ob3cHPmE,5234,"1,663",19,Hürtgen forest and the end of World War II | Free Full DW Documentary,2020-05-02,81468,"DW Documentary gives you information beyond the headlines.

How has coronavirus impacted climate change? Can methods used to track climate change be used to track the spread of coronavirus? We explore these topics and a lot more. Our first guest is Gavin Schmidt, PhD, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. To start, we get a little background on CO2 emissions. How has the air quality changed over the current quarantined period? You’ll learn how the decrease of car and air travel have impacted our climate. We explore how climate modeling is similar to modeling the spread of coronavirus. You’ll also learn the benefits of “simple” vs “complex” modeling. Gavin tells us why models are fundamental to scientific enterprise. Then we welcome our second guest, Katharine Hayhoe, PhD, director of the Climate Center at Texas Tech University. She also has her own YouTube channel called @Global Weirding with Katharine Hayhoe. Katharine explains how coronavirus made the jump from animals to humans (zoonosis) and why this is not the first, or last, time it will happen. You’ll hear why the current pandemic is like a microcosm of climate change. We investigate the role that government has played in this pandemic so far and what governments can learn from dealing with this situation. Katharine explains how this pandemic and climate change are similar in the fact that they both impact the poorest people the hardest. We take a look at the spread of conspiracy theories during this pandemic and how they come from the same places that spread climate change conspiracies. Lastly, you’ll also hear about climatefeedback.org, a website run by a network of scientists to bring you truthful climate change news. All that, plus, Katharine shares a hopeful message for the future.===================================About the prints that flank Neil in this video: ""Black Swan” & ""White Swan"" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston.

DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2020-04-23,"China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan appear to have coronavirus pretty well under control. Much of that is down to early response, close monitoring and extensive use of modern science and technology. And not to be overlooked: the citizens willingness to adhere to government-imposed regulations.Reporters in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan look into how these countries have weathered the crisis and largely contain the coronavirus. In South Korea, rigorous testing and state-of-the-art technology have been key in keeping the number of infections and deaths low. In Taiwan, access to masks and a sense of solidarity help to hold the virus at bay. In Japan, discipline and strict hygiene measures have allowed public life to continue without too much interruption, even in densely populated Tokyo. And in China, where the coronavirus pandemic started, quarantines, lock-down and strict surveillance have contributed to slowing spread. Whether or not these methods prove sustainable in the long run remains to be seen. But they are sending a message of hope that there may be ways out of the coronavirus crisis.-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

PBS NewsHour,UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,/channel/UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,2019-12-09,"Barry Berke, the House Democratic counsel, questioned Republican counsel Stephen Castor and fellow Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman on Dec. 9. The questioning came on the second day of public hearings by the House Judiciary Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Berke asked a question that both Castor and Goldman appeared to agree on. “Is it your experience, that when someone has done something wrongful and corrupt, and they’re dealing with somebody who’s not in the scheme, that they state their intentions to do something wrongful and corrupt?” Berke asked. Castor said no, in a general sense. In answering Berke’s question, Goldman said, “You almost never have a defendant ... who would ever explicitly say … 'I’m going to bribe you now. I’m going to ask you for a bribe. I’m going to extort you.' That’s not how things work.” The Judiciary and Intelligence committees have led the probe, hearing testimony from witnesses and legal experts about Trump’s conduct. House lawmakers are currently drafting the articles of impeachment, on which House lawmakers are anticipated to vote in the coming weeks. The impeachment case has revolved around a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics...Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSnapchat: @pbsnewsSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe",697,PT47M54S,News & Politics,r5YOqIK7Bkk,8131,"1,868",20,WATCH: Democratic counsel’s questioning of committee lawyers | Trump impeachment hearings,2019-12-09,389362,PBS NewsHour is one of the most trusted news programs in television and online.,873986814,0,1800000,False,29860

Despite there being many variations of the Sicilian, there are also lots of similarities in each side’s formations.In this video, a preview of her Secrets of Chess Strategy (Beginner), Susan reveals some of the opening traps you need to be aware of.When either side moves their c-pawn (always Black in the Sicilian, often White too), this allows possible Qa4+/Qa5+ moves and undefended pieces are often lost to this move. Also, with only the c and d-pawns moved, Black has to be careful of Bb5+. If the Queen’s Bishop and Knight have moved, Black might have to give up his Queen.These themes and more lend themselves to more subtle combinations as revealed in this video. It’s quite easy for either side to lose a piece in the first ten moves. Knowing these patterns will help you avoid embarrassing blunders and trap a few opponents too.Susan will also show you some even more deadly attacks. Often Black’s King is somewhat smothered by the closeness of his own pieces. A well-timed sacrifice, often for a pawn on e6, can open lines for a mating attack; again, very early in the game.It pays to know about the typical tactics in the Sicilian Defense, perhaps above all other openings. Which squares become weak and why, when and where to sacrifice material and which moves to be very careful about. Watch this video and you will be well prepared to survive and profit from this opening.",209,PT29M3S,People & Blogs,iX9iJGrqlpQ,4342,"3,725",19,Master 👉 The Typical Tactics in The Sicilian Defense 🤔 - GM Susan Polgar,2016-07-26,360176,"iChess Channel 2 is the home of premium Grandmaster replays from ChessLecture, Foxy, Roman's Lab and more!

On this episode of StarTalk Radio, Neil deGrasse Tyson answers your fan-submitted questions about the mysteries, wonders, and theories that exist on the bleeding edge of cosmology. But in order to explore the true depths of the unknown we need to bring in a little extra help – enter astrophysicist Janna Levin, PhD. We start with the basics: is the universe infinite? Janna tells us why we’re still uncertain. We explore the idea of the multiverse and the idea of our universe never having an “edge.” Could those distant galaxies we see be our own galaxy in the past? As if that’s not mind-bending enough, we haven’t even gotten to the dimensionality questions yet. Find out more about other possible dimensions. We discuss why it’s so difficult to detect other dimensions, if they’re even there in the first place. Janna and Neil help us visualize a 4th dimension. You’ll hear why adding another dimension might provide too much freedom for molecules to bind together and create macroscopic things. We also explore the idea that our three dimensions are glued to a membrane that’s floating in a higher dimensional space. We reflect on Monsters, Inc. and how the film plays with moving through different dimensions.Discover more about the shape of our universe. Could it be in the shape of a loop? We break down the Big Bang and the birth of the universe. Find out more about dark matter, dark energy, and if they’re two sides of the same coin. Janna explains why dark energy should be thought of as an invisible ocean. Investigate the “information” that lies on the surface of a black hole. We track Voyager 2’s journey into interstellar space and what that means for us back on Earth. All that, plus, Janna shares why she thinks the study of dark matter and dark energy are the most important fields of study in science today.This episode originally aired December 6, 2019.Support us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradioSubscribe to StarTalk: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalk...Follow StarTalk:Twitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradioFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalkInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/About StarTalk: Science meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Bayer’s share price halved last year, and the consequences are already making themselves felt in the company itself: Around 12,000 jobs worldwide are to be cut in the next few years, a considerable proportion of them in Germany. CEO Werner Baumann, who pushed for the merger, is coming under increasing pressure. Voicing criticism, a majority of shareholders voted against absolving Baumann and other managers of their responsibility in the merger. Bayer is in the midst of its greatest crisis.The film traces the effects of the merger and investigates potential new health hazards emanating from glyphosate. How has Monsanto tried in the past to influence politicians, scientists and public opinion? Did the Americans actually play down or ignore the dangers? And does Bayer really distance itself from these practices?--------------------------------------------------------------------Subscribe to DW Documentary:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39...Our other YouTube channels:DW Documental (in spanish): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocumentalDW Documentary وثائقية دي دبليو: (in arabic): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocarabiaFor more documentaries visit also:http://www.dw.com/en/tv/docfilm/s-3610Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/dwdocumentary/Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/dw.storiesDW netiquette policy: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G",182,PT42M26S,Education,EwllBdC0Iww,8333,"4,342",20,Turning toxic — the Bayer-Monsanto merger | DW Documentary,2019-09-11,334423,"DW Documentary gives you information beyond the headlines.

Today, with modern computers, we know that many of his speculative sacrifices were inaccurate and should have lost. Nevertheless, he had a daring style of play, and that was very intimidating for those who played against him.Tal himself said “There are two types of sacrifices: correct ones, and mine.” However, it was not easy, even for the world’s best players, to refute these sacrifices over the board, and some analysts were unable to show why or how Tal could have been defeated. Today we’re going to see one of the most complicated chess games ever played; a game between Mikhail Tal and Alexander Koblents in 1957. You won’t believe – Tal (technically) sacrificed all his pieces (not the king though xP), from pawn to queen.

HooverInstitution,UCzWwWbbKHg4aodl0S35R6XA,/channel/UCzWwWbbKHg4aodl0S35R6XA,2019-05-06,"Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump’s “personal authenticity” during the campaign and how the media has a “historical amnesia” of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump’s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn’t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California’s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that’s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Fauci had been sought as a witness for a House Appropriations Committee subcommittee that was looking into the U.S. response to the pandemic, according to Evan Hollander, a committee spokesman. “We have been informed by an administration official that the White House has blocked Dr. Fauci from testifying,” Hollander said on Friday afternoon. The White House later confirmed that Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, would not be appearing.Gilead Sciences Inc.’s antiviral drug remdesivir was cleared by U.S. regulators for emergency use in Covid-19 patients, becoming the first medication backed by early clinical data to be made available to fight the novel coronavirus. Remdesivir reduced the time it took hospitalized Covid-19 patients to recover in an interim analysis of an ongoing study. The Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency-use authorization, President Donald Trump said on Friday, a step by which the agency can allow products to be used without full data on their safety and efficacy. Gilead shares closed down 4.8% on Friday at $79.95 in New York. The company has faced questions from investors about how it plans to make money on the drug, but its stock is still up 23% this year, at a time when the rest of the market has cratered. “This was lighting speed in terms of getting something approved,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking with Trump. “From clinical trial to getting it authorized, it was 90 days.”Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.","4,953",PT0M0S,News & Politics,VcCBMKNN5Mc,82,"5,558",20,Coronavirus Updates: Trump Blocks Fauci From Testifying to Congress; FDA OKs Gilead's Remdesivir,2020-05-01,1744603,Global news the world needs today.,139707613,0,245000,False,5848

But just what is there to know about Fred Jr., Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert? Well, spoiler alert: It turns out they're no strangers to controversy.According to The Washington Post, Donald Trump doesn't drink alcohol, and it was his eldest brother, Fred Trump Jr., who reportedly scared him straight. Fred Jr. was reportedly expected to take over the family's budding real estate empire, but his real passion was flying airplanes. He left the family business and began working for Trans World Airlines as a pilot, according to The New York Times. He then married a flight attendant, and the couple had two children together.When Fred Jr. reached his mid-20s, he began drinking heavily, and it soon took over his life. Knowing his addiction could put him and others at risk, Fred Jr. quit his job as a pilot.

The Economist,UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,/channel/UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,2019-11-18,"Modern families with two working adults are richer than those with a single breadwinner, and can afford to take a different approach to parenting. This is exacerbating inequality between rich and poor families.Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy The family has always been a central building block of society. But families have changed dramatically in the rich world over the past 50 years. Changes to society mean that the old model of a breadwinning husband and a stay-at-home wife has all but collapsed. And the different ways rich and poor families raise their children are increasing social inequality. Today, gay families like Maggie and Joelle’s are widely accepted in the rich world. A generation ago, it was almost unthinkable that same-sex couples would get married.But now most people in rich countries think gay marriage is fine. Fears that gay marriages would undermine heterosexual ones have proven unfounded. And this is one reason why marriage equality has spread so extraordinarily fast. Before 2001 gay marriage was not legal anywhere in the world. Since then, it’s been legalised in nearly all rich countries and developing nations are starting to follow suit. It’s a far cry from the 1960s, when families typically consisted of a dad who went to work a stay-at-home mum and three or more kids. Better access for women to contraception education and jobs has changed this traditional family portrait. Across the globe, families are shrinking. Nowhere more so than in South Korea. Here a growing number of women are rejecting marriage and having children altogether like Go Lee, who is 26. She says traditional employers make it hard to combine a career with marriage and motherhood. Go works in IT, but is also a vlogger on YouTube, where she urges South Korean women to be more assertive. She believes South Korean men are part of the problemMany expect their wives to do all the housework and childcare, even if they have a job. There is a huge mismatch of expectations around marriage in South Korea. Most men want a 1950s-style relationship whereas women want something more modern and equal. The result is they often end up not marrying or having kids at all  and that’s left South Korea with a problem. Its population is in free fall. In 1960 the average South Korean woman had six children. In 2018 that figure shrank to less than one. A fertility rate of one means each generation is half as big as the previous one and in South Korea this means there are fewer workers to support the country’s ageing population. In rural areas, men are viewed as poor prospects by South Korean women. So the government is helping these men to find brides from poorer countries.State-funded assimilation centres like this, teach immigrant brides how to cook Korean food how to speak Korean and even how to deal with Korean mothers-in-law. Like most of her classmates studying here today 19-year-old Nguyen Thi Cam Thuy is from Vietnam. She recently married a South Korean man 40-year-old Kim Dae Hyun who found her through a matchmaking website. Over a fifth of married South Korean farmers and fishermen have tied the knot with a foreigner. But cross-cultural unions can be difficult and around a fifth of marriages between South Korean men and foreign women end in divorce within four years. This video of a man beating his foreign wife caused widespread outrage. 50 years ago in most rich countries domestic violence was considered normal. Now, it is universally condemned and rates have fallen sharply by three-quarters in America alone, since the mid-1990s. Today, other factors are more likely to affect the stability of families and these are contributing to a growing gulf between middle-class and working-class families. In most rich countries, if you don’t go to university you are more likely to have kids outside of marriage. And women who don’t finish high school are more likely to end up as single mothers than women who have a degree. In Jamie’s hometown of Hartlepool in north-east England, 70% of babies are born outside marriage like her twins, Sean and Liam. In Hartlepool in the 1960s men did heavy work in shipyards and factories which was much better paid than any job their wives could find. So the women stayed at home with the kids. But as technology advances manual work has dried up and uneducated men have struggled to find good jobs. If the only men available lack steady jobs and don’t help around the home some women feel they are better off alone. Middle-class families have remained solid in rich countries over the past 50 years while working-class families have grown much less stable. Women with a university degree are more likely than women who do not finish high school to be married and raise children with their husband as a team.","1,508",PT18M36S,News & Politics,hSmAYUnZyxE,3432,"12,023",20,How modern families increase social inequality | The Economist,2019-11-18,476727,"Every Thursday The Economist posts videos that give authoritative insight and opinion on international news, politics, business, finance, science, technology and the connections between them.

I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc.  I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru.  My school teaches survival and primitive skills, nature awareness,  how to live off the land, re-wilding and how to prepare for disasters.

I began this journey in 1994, studying under Tom Brown Jr. Later on I lived in the woods for a year in a shelter I built from forest materials, made my own traps, bows, arrows, fire-making materials, pottery, deer hide clothing, baskets...etc. At 21 I became one of a few instructors for Tom Brown's Wilderness School and taught there for 5 years. Got a BA from Rutgers University in Anthropology and a Masters in UN Policy for Indigenous peoples.

Did you choose yourself to be offline or was internet not working? To be offline seems more and more to become a choice that we see as a luxury. Is being offline the new luxury or is it still a luxury to be online for some people?Digital networks are becoming denser and denser. We are online all the time everywhere and they are fewer places where we really can be alone. Where and when can we still disconnect? To be offline has become a luxury. Will we permanently use data or do we take back control over our connectivity? In this documentary we go on a journey to the edge of internet. To be online all the time and everywhere. It sounds great, but it has its drawbacks. As digital networks are closing in, there are fewer places to be really on your own. Being offline is becoming a luxury. Where can you be offline? We are connected to the internet even in our bedrooms. It’s the ambition of companies like Google and Facebook to connect the entire world, so that we can be online all the time and everywhere. Google has sent balloons up into the skies over Sri Lanka to provide the island state with free Wi-Fi for a month. On the ground, more and more devices communicate through the so-called Internet-of-Things. We are going to be ‘glass citizens’ in a transparent house, connected for life to a wireless intravenous drip and traced anywhere via our smartphones. What does it mean? A small but growing group of people is saying goodbye to lifetime connectability. They are researching ways to keep control. What can we learn from them about life in the digital era?

China in Focus - NTD,UCBOqkAGTtzZVmKvY4SwdZ2g,/channel/UCBOqkAGTtzZVmKvY4SwdZ2g,2020-04-07,"As the world is gripped by the ongoing pandemic, many questions remain about the origin of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus—commonly known as the novel coronavirus.Join Epoch Times senior investigative reporter Joshua Philipp as he explores the known facts surrounding the CCP virus and the global pandemic it caused.In his investigation, Philipp explores the scientific data, and interviews top scientists and national security experts. And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.Editor's note:From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself—in 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts’ opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.Some of our viewers felt the #documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.#wuhan #VirusOrigin--------Sign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party▶️https://ccpvirustruth.com---------Subscribe: http://bit.ly/2vhu9EjContact us or make a donation via PayPal: chinainfocus@ntdtv.orgSupport us: https://www.ntd.com/support-us.htmlTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChinaInFocusNTDFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NTDChinainFocusWebsite: https://www.ntd.com/china-in-focus---------Watch more: Exclusive: Wuhan funeral home staffer reveals real death toll of coronavirus: https://bit.ly/3bpMTBsCCP virus follows communist China ties: https://bit.ly/2UsNVWcGiving the right name to the virus causing a global pandemic: https://bit.ly/2wzV3IBUndercover video reveals new evidence on forced organ harvesting in China: https://bit.ly/2wBE7RRFull movie: ‘Claws of the Red Dragon’ exposes connection between Huawei and CCP: https://bit.ly/2wW1R3C------------------Get the latest updates as well as exclusive reporting and first-hand videos about the CCP virus from The Epoch Times website.▶️ https://www.theepochtimes.com/ccp-virusUpdated on April 14, 2020.","3,575",PT54M18S,News & Politics,Le_rfTdayLs,24,"58,376",20,"1st documentary movie on the origin of CCP virus, Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus",2020-04-07,3087158,"""China in Focus"" is a new Youtube channel created by NTD to provide viewers with fast, compelling, first-hand news from China.

Crossroads with JOSHUA PHILIPP,UCG8yy4W8nBbTle9YSpCqXeg,/channel/UCG8yy4W8nBbTle9YSpCqXeg,2020-04-07,"As the world is gripped by the ongoing pandemic, many questions remain about the origin of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus—commonly known as the novel coronavirus.Join Epoch Times senior investigative reporter Joshua Philipp as he explores the known facts surrounding the CCP virus and the global pandemic it caused.In his investigation, Philipp explores the scientific data, and interviews top scientists and national security experts. And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.Editor's note:From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself—in 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts’ opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.Some of our viewers felt the documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.#ccpvirus #wuhan #coronavirus- - - - - - - - -Sign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party▶️https://ccpvirustruth.com- - - - - - - - -Subscribe for updates: http://bit.ly/CrossroadsYTMake a donation:  https://donorbox.org/crossroads-joshu...https://twitter.com/crossroads_joshFollow us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrossroadsET- - - - - - - - -Hosted by @JoshJPhilipphttps://twitter.com/JoshJPhilippSUBSCRIBE TO THE EPOCH TIMESPrint subscription (delivery inside the U.S only):https://theepochtimes.f2vr2q.net/q9BobProduced by @EpochTimeshttps://twitter.com/EpochTimes- - - - - - - - -WATCH MORE ON YOUTUBE🔵 Escape from Wuhan: 55,000 People Flee; Second Wave Of Outbreaks? | CCP virus | Crossroads https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDI9e...🔵 Ending lockdowns in Wuhan?

Paolo fromTOKYO,UCixD9UbKvDxzGNiPC_fgHyA,/channel/UCixD9UbKvDxzGNiPC_fgHyA,2019-08-16,"Understanding Japanese laws to avoid foreigner tourist arrests.  Thanks to Squarespace, get 10% Off: https://www.squarespace.com/paolofrom...The Japanese justice system and Japanese laws are stricter than many countries and sometimes lead to foreigner arrests in Japan simply because foreigners are unaware of Japan laws and Japan justice system.  The Japanese judicial system has 99% conviction rate in Japan so foreigners should be mindful and aware how strict Japan laws and rules are.  Japanese Police arrests tourist in Japan or Japan Police arrest foreigners in Japan when they are under suspicion of a crime.  Suspects will be brought into police custody to be interrogated for 3 days and if the Japanese police are still not satisfied, the police can request for additional detainment for up to 23 days total, without the suspect being officially charged with a crime in Japan.  In this video, I interview a Japanese Trial Lawyer, Yugo Ishibashi, to help me understand the Japanese justice system as well as to share with foreigners and tourists how Japanese law works in Japan and maybe gain some insight on what options a foreigner has if arrested in Japan.  Japanese police interrogation is quite stressful and Yugo mentions that sometimes suspects plead guilty even though they didn't commit the crime due to the pressure of the Japanese police interrogation.   If suspects don't plead guilty to the crime, it may be possible to be detained for more than a year until the suspect confess to a crime.  This is sometimes referred to as Hostage Justice in Japan.  Convicted persons will end up in Japanese Jail and Japanese prison.  This video should help educate tourist visiting Japan and foreigners living in Japan to help ensure that they are aware of how strict Japanese laws are so that they are careful to not violate the laws when they are in Japan.  But keep in mind that these laws are one of the reasons why Japan is so safe compared to many other countries.  This video is not to deter foreigners or tourists from visiting Japan, but they should just be aware of Japanese laws and the risks when breaking laws in Japan like graffiti in japan or fighting in japan.

He is a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a senior fellow at both the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and the Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute. His March 24, 2020, article in the Wall Street Journal questions the premise that “coronavirus would kill millions without shelter-in-place orders and quarantines.” In the article he suggests that “there’s little evidence to confirm that premise—and projections of the death toll could plausibly be orders of magnitude too high.” In this edition of Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson we asked Dr. Bhattacharya to defend that statement and describe to us how he arrived at this conclusion. We get into the details of his research, which used data collected from hotspots around the world and his background as a doctor, a medical researcher, and an economist. It’s not popular right now to question conventional wisdom on sheltering in place, but Dr. Bhattacharya makes a strong case for challenging it, based in economics and science.
