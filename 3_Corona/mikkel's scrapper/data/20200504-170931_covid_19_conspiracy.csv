Deadly bacteria and the pharmaceutical industry | DW Documentary,Education,270993,"2,945",128,"Multi-resistant bacteria are currently the greatest danger to modern medicine and threaten millions of lives. Experts around the world are extremely worried.Every year, hundreds of thousands of people die due to multi-resistant bacteria - bacteria where many antibiotics are no longer effective. And drug manufacturers are contributing to the problem. Many infectious diseases have long been regarded as defeated. But countless antibiotics are now proving ineffective against a growing number of multi-resistant germs. The documentary shows, however, that the manufacturers of the most important drugs are themselves contributing to the development of extremely resistant germs and spreading them globally - so that even their own drugs are no longer effective. The filmmakers went to India, a global producer of pharmaceuticals, to explore claims that practices there are at the heart of the problem. The consequences could affect us all._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

While the spatial size of the entire Universe is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe.The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the centre of the Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.Further observational improvements led to the realization that our Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in a galaxy we call the Milky Way, which is one of hundreds of billions (perhaps trillions[which?]) of galaxies in the Universe. Many of these stars have planets. At the largest scale galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then, and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.*Keywords:UNIVERSE COMPARISON, UNIVERSE COMPARISON 3D COMPARISON OF UNIVERSE, SYSTEM SOLAR SIZE COMPARISON, COMPARISON OF SOLAR SYSTEM, GALAXY COMPARISON , COMPARISON OF GALAXIES, GALAXIES COMPARIOSN, STAR SIZE COMPARISON, STAR COMPARISON, STARS COMPARISON, COMPARISON OF STARS SIZE, COMPARISON OF STAR,Space comparison, Comparison of spaceBlack holes Comparison, Black hole comparison, Comparison of black holes, First Photo of black hole,",PT19M27S,2018-09-27,2018-09-27,14341,RED SIDE,/channel/UCrYB2eCu6M_aKVLYcTb6JUg,UCrYB2eCu6M_aKVLYcTb6JUg,19,l03_BnPRIKc

The Power of Bicycles | F.K. Day | TEDxMidAtlantic,Nonprofits & Activism,48736,955,13,"Frederick (F.K.) Day is a long time Chicago businessman, entrepreneur and humanitarian. In 1987, Day, his brother Stan and some friends founded leading bicycle component supplier, SRAM Corporation. In 2005, immediately following the Indian Ocean Tsunami, Day and his wife Leah, with support from SRAM Corp and the bicycle industry, founded international non-profit World Bicycle Relief. Their first program delivered over 24,000 new bicycles to men, women and children in Tsunami impacted Sri Lanka. In his TEDx talk, Day illustrates the profound transformation that takes place when a person whose primary mode of transportation is walking, is provided a bicycle.  In Sub-Saharan Africa, roughly 600 million people live in rural communities where walking is the only option for many. Every day is about racing the sun, from sunup to sundown, trying to complete the day’s work before the darkness of night. Each step is a race to overcome the barrier of distance.  Through his firsthand experience in the field with World Bicycle Relief, Day describes the quantum leap in productivity that occurs when students, healthcare workers and entrepreneurs are mobilized through the power of bicycles.  He illuminates why bicycles are an overlooked development solution and why there can be a world where distance is no longer a barrier to education, healthcare and economic empowerment.  World Bicycle Relief employs over 100+ people in the US, Asia and Africa, and operates 5 bicycle assembly facilities in Kenya, Malawi, Angola Zambia and Zimbabwe. To date, over 350,000 specially designed, locally assembled bicycles have been distributed and over 1,700 field mechanics have been trained. In 2010, Day and World Bicycle Relief were named #12 on Barron’s list of the World‘s Top 25 Most Effective Givers. In 2015, Fast Company named World Bicycle Relief among its’ Most Innovative Companies for organizations working on the continent of Africa. Frederick (F.K.)

LIVE market coverage: Monday May 4 Yahoo Finance,News & Politics,665,87,9,"Get the latest up-to-the-minute continuous stock market coverage and big interviews in the world of finance every Monday–Friday from 9 am to 5pm (ET).#YahooFinance #Stocks #coronaviruscovid19The lineup:9am - 11am: The First Trade11am - 1pm: On The Move1pm - 3pm: The Ticker3pm - 5pm: The Final Round#Stockmarket #coronavirus #YahooFinanceStock futures were lower Friday morning after the latest batch of corporate earnings results suggested a grim outlook for the current quarter and President Donald Trump threatened retaliation on China over the coronavirus pandemic.Earnings results from some of the most heavily weighted companies in the major U.S. stock indices came in mixed after market close Thursday. Amazon (AMZN) posted first-quarter sales that jumped 26% over last year, but warned that $4 billion in expected coronavirus-related costs could drag operating income negative to the tune of $1.5 billion.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) reported quarterly revenue that was virtually flat over last year, and declined to offer an outlook due to uncertainty over the pandemic.Separately, during a briefing Thursday, President Donald Trump said his phase one trade deal with China was now eclipsed by the more imminent reality of the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in the country. Trump has criticized China over its handling of the outbreak and claimed he had seen evidence that the virus was started in a Wuhan lab, though other U.S. officials have downplayed that claim.Despite ending the regular session lower on Thursday, the S&P 500 closed out April on a high note and posted its best monthly gain since 1987. The blue-chip index climbed a total of 12.68% for the month, but was still off 14% from its record high on February 19, and down nearly 10% year to date.“We forecast further gains in most risky assets between now and the end of next year. This reflects our expectation of a rebound in economic activity starting in the second half of 2020, alongside the continuation of massive monetary and fiscal policy support,” John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Thursday.“Admittedly, risky assets have already recovered quite a lot of the ground that they lost after the outbreak of coronavirus. And two key downside risks remain,” he added.“First, success in containing the virus could be reversed as economies reopen. Second, the consensus for policy support might break down,” he said. “But assuming these risks do not materialize, we anticipate that the rally will continue.”Still, equities are entering what has historically been a tougher six-month period in terms of comparable returns.During that time frame, the S&P 500 have averaged returns of just 1.5% during the May through October period since 1950, according to LPL Research data, and ended the period higher just 64.3% of the time. In more recent history, however, stocks produced positive gains in seven of the past eight six-month periods between May and October, and as much as 10% during the similar period in 2013.The recent stock rally comes despite mounting evidence of the damage the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures have inflicted on the domestic economy. A government report Thursday showed another 3.8 million Americans filed for new unemployment claims last week, bringing the total over the past six weeks to more than 30 million.But the outbreak at least showed further signs of easing on Thursday, fueling hopes that businesses could slowly begin to open across more jurisdictions and lead to a recovery in economic activity. U.S. coronavirus cases rose just 1.2% on Thursday for the slowest pace of increase of the month, according to Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins compiled data. Overall cases have topped 1.05 million in the U.S. and 3.2 million globally.7:23 a.m. ET Friday: Stock futures fallHere were the main moves in markets ahead of the opening bell, as of 7:24 a.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): down 59.5 points, or 2.05%, to 2,843.00Dow futures (YM=F): down 461.00 points, or 1.90%, to 23,769.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): down 229.00 points, or 2.55%, to 8,759.5Crude (CL=F): -$0.03 (-0.16%) to $18.81 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$7.00 (-0.41%) to $1,687.20 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.3 bps to yield 0.612%For more on this article visit:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-...",PT0M0S,2020-05-01,2020-05-01,142322,Yahoo Finance,/channel/UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,20,EN17r19LemI
AlphaGo - The Movie | Full Documentary,Science & Technology,1113424,"31,646",558,"With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game?

Agafia. Hermit Surviving in Russian Wilderness for 70 years,Travel & Events,6733904,"41,909","5,650","More films about religion: https://rtd.rt.com/tags/religion/Soon after this film aired, Agafia found a helper who has now been living with her for more than a year. Georgy Danilov, 53, is from Orenburg. He is an Old Believer. It was Agafia’s spiritual father who found and blessed her helper. Georgy has been doing the toughest chores for almost two years: he chops firewood, brings water from the river, and digs the vegetable garden. Agafia doesn’t always see eye to eye with Georgy. She views him as a novice and demands his full obedience and submission, which doesn’t always sit well with Georgy. Despite their differences, they try to find common ground. Apart from the main helper, volunteers and students from various Russian cities also come to Agafia’s hut to help her out.In the mid-17th century, the leader of Russia’s Orthodox Church, Patriarch Nikon, introduced radical reforms in Russia. Many couldn’t accept the changes and became known as “Old Believers”. To avoid religious persecution first from the Orthodox Church and then from the Soviets, families fled to some of the most remote corners of the world. In 1978, one such family was discovered by a group of geologists in the remote Russian Republic of Khakassia, Siberia. The Lykovs looked as if they belonged to a previous century: they dressed in homespun clothes and used primitive instruments in their everyday life. They were completely self-sufficient and still highly religious. Today, Agafia, 70, is the last surviving member of this family.  When RT Doc filmmakers met her, she was in desperate need of a helper. They encourage her to write a letter to Old Believers everywhere in an attempt to find one. This letter, written in Old Slavonic language, is available on our site.The film crew also interviews Erofey Sedov, a former drilling geologist. He was one of those who discovered the Lykovs and told the world about them. He got to know them well and is now ready to share information that will make us see the familiar story of this family of hermits in a different light.

What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO, 2020). Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the origin and zoonosis of COVID-19, the routes of transmission, epidemiology (current as of 3/15/2020), pathophysiology, and diagnostic tests used to identify COVID-19.

Why Big Tech Wants You To Ditch Your Password,News & Politics,1269052,"19,868","1,026","The average office worker in the United States must keep track of between 20 to 40 different username and password combinations. With so many passwords to remember, many of us use the same ones over and over, or have a running list of passwords saved somewhere. Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. It’s why companies like Microsoft , Apple and Google are trying to reduce our dependence on them. But the question is, can these companies break our bad habits?Update (January 21, 2020): A website mentioned in this video, WeLeakInfo, was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies on Friday, Jan. 17, 2020. The site claimed to have more than 12 billion usernames and passwords from more than 10,000 data breaches.Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. A report by Verizon looked at 2,013 confirmed data breaches and found that 29% of those breaches involved the use of stolen credentials.Another study by the Ponemon Institute and IBM Security found that the average cost of a single data breach in the U.S. was more than $8 million. Even when passwords are not stolen, companies can lose a lot of money trying to reset them.“Our research has shown that the average fully loaded cost of a help desk call to reset a password is anywhere between $40 or $50 per call,” says Merritt Maxim, vice president and research director at Forrester.“Generally speaking, a typical employee contacts a help desk somewhere between 6 and 10 times a year on password related issues,” Maxim said. “So if you just do the simple multiplication of six to 10 times, times 50 dollars per call, times number of employees, in your organization, you’re talking significantly hundreds of thousands of dollars or even potentially millions of dollars a year.”» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

The MOST EVIL KIDS in the History of the Mankind,Education,4404631,"72,323","2,663","WHO ARE THE MOST EVIL KIDS?You’ve probably heard the saying, “Kids can be so cruel,” which is usually in reference to schoolyard bullying. It might also relate to such things as young kids pulling the legs off spiders. Psychologists tell us one of the reasons for such cruelty, especially against animals, is that children have not fully developed their sense of empathy. Sometimes they just don’t understand the gravity of their actions. But then older kids should know better. Psychologists also tell us older kids that tend to be evil might have suffered from abusive relationships. They might also just be little psychopaths in the making, domineering devils with an anti-social attitude, and sometimes it seems there’s no rational explanation why they are they way they are.

How can citizens regain control of their data?It is 2000, and the dot.com crisis has caused deep wounds. How will startup Google survive the bursting of the internet bubble? Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin don't know anymore how to turn the tide. By chance, Google discovers that the ""residual data"" that people leave behind in their searches on the internet is very precious and tradable.This residual data can be used to predict the behavior of the internet user. Internet advertisements can, therefore, be used in a very targeted and effective way.

"""Spooky"" physics | Leo Kouwenhoven | TEDxDelft",Science & Technology,1408374,"8,407",760,"What Einstein called ""spooky,"" Physicist Leo Kouwenhoven calls the future. In this illuminating talk, he explains quantum entanglement -- the property that shows how particles can affect each other, even if they're on opposite ends of the universe -- and demonstrates how we will manipulate it to revolutionize the way our computers work.Leo Kouwenhoven is professor Quantum Transport. Quantum mechanics is the theory of atoms and elementary particles. Man itself is made out of atoms as well so quantum is the basis of our existence: life as we know it. Recent studies show that even large objects act quantum like existing in two places at the same time. Leo and his team can visualise this behaviour to the naked eye because these two places are now one centimeter away from each other. Imagine the possibilities (for mankind) when the distance increases.  That's a one centimeter step for man, one giant leap for mankind.On 7 November 2011 over 900 people gathered in the beautiful city of Delft for the first TEDx event in Delft, the Netherlands: TEDxDelft.

Well, if we are talking about what men are looking for in a physical sense, it seems science has worked that out for us. Some of those physical characteristics we are told include women having shiny white teeth. Studies also tell us men like strong hips. This is related to childbirth. Do men really prefer blondes though? Not according to one study in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, which tells us more men like brunettes. Men also prefer long hair, and the healthier looking the better. Again, this is related to fertility as lots of healthy-looking hair shows vitality – a vitality passed onto offspring.

"1st documentary movie on the origin of CCP virus, Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus",News & Politics,3153648,"59,495","3,699","As the world is gripped by the ongoing pandemic, many questions remain about the origin of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus—commonly known as the novel coronavirus.Join Epoch Times senior investigative reporter Joshua Philipp as he explores the known facts surrounding the CCP virus and the global pandemic it caused.In his investigation, Philipp explores the scientific data, and interviews top scientists and national security experts. And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.Editor's note:From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself—in 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts’ opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.Some of our viewers felt the #documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.#wuhan #VirusOrigin--------Sign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party▶️https://ccpvirustruth.com---------Subscribe: http://bit.ly/2vhu9EjContact us or make a donation via PayPal: chinainfocus@ntdtv.orgSupport us: https://www.ntd.com/support-us.htmlTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChinaInFocusNTDFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NTDChinainFocusWebsite: https://www.ntd.com/china-in-focus---------Watch more: Exclusive: Wuhan funeral home staffer reveals real death toll of coronavirus: https://bit.ly/3bpMTBsCCP virus follows communist China ties: https://bit.ly/2UsNVWcGiving the right name to the virus causing a global pandemic: https://bit.ly/2wzV3IBUndercover video reveals new evidence on forced organ harvesting in China: https://bit.ly/2wBE7RRFull movie: ‘Claws of the Red Dragon’ exposes connection between Huawei and CCP: https://bit.ly/2wW1R3C------------------Get the latest updates as well as exclusive reporting and first-hand videos about the CCP virus from The Epoch Times website.▶️ https://www.theepochtimes.com/ccp-virusUpdated on April 14, 2020.",PT54M18S,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,234154,China in Focus - NTD,/channel/UCBOqkAGTtzZVmKvY4SwdZ2g,UCBOqkAGTtzZVmKvY4SwdZ2g,20,Le_rfTdayLs

The Snowden files -- the inside story of the world’s most wanted man | Luke Harding | TEDxAthens,Nonprofits & Activism,976178,"11,026",698,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. ""We now know, thanks to Edward Snowden- that all of us, Greek citizens, Brits, Americans are being spied and that all of our data - whether its text messages, selfies, G-allocation data from our iphones that we carry around with us - is being collected. Luke thinks that Snowden has done the world a great service by revealing this and thinks it’s got profound implications for democracy – and for all of us – for anyone who uses Facebook or Google or downloads videos from Youtube and so on.So that’s the big picture. On a micro level what we can do about this as citizens?""Luke Harding is a journalist, writer and award-winning correspondent with the Guardian. He has reported from Delhi, Berlin and Moscow and covered wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. Between 2007 and 2011 he was the Guardian's Moscow bureau chief. The Kremlin expelled him from the country in the first case of its kind since the Cold War.His latest book ""The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man"" was published in February by Guardian Faber. In June Oliver Stone bought film rights. Luke is the author of three previous non-fiction books. They are ""The Liar: The Fall of Jonathan Aitken"" (1997), nominated for the Orwell Prize; and ""WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy"" (2011), both written with David Leigh. The screen rights to Wikileaks were sold to Hollywood and the film, ""The Fifth Estate"", starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Bruhl, came out in 2013. ""Mafia State: How One Reporter Became an Enemy of the Brutal New Russia"" appeared in 2011. His books have been translated into 20 languages.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

I Saw My Bf's locked Messages,Education,1063111,"30,730","1,471","I headed to the place where I was hiding. Mrs. Jenny’s House, the old lady who lives next door. She’s been away for a while, visiting her son who lives in another state and I snuck into her place. It turned out to be the perfect hiding place, neither my parents nor the police thought of searching it.I got to the house and went through the kitchen's back door. I made sure not to turn any lights on, so no one would notice that someone was living here. I slightly pulled the curtains and checked our house. Everything was normal, for now at least. Oh you are asking why am I doing this?It all started a month ago at my highschool. Suddenly, being popular was about having expensive stuff. And by expensive, I mean REALLY EXPENSIVE! Things only my friend Tess could afford because her dad was a millionaire. She bought this designer bag that cost 20,000$ and brought it to school. All the girls wanted to take a picture of it and all the boys wanted to flirt with Tess because they thought she would shower them with gifts. You know, since she got the money.And it worked! Tess started dating James, the most popular boy at school. I was jealous. ِActually all the girls were jealous. So they started doing the same, buying expensive stuff and showing them off hoping it’ll catch a guy’s attention, or any attention for that matter.",PT10M15S,2020-04-23,2020-04-23,112442,My Story Animated,/channel/UCYzEMRKqrh01-tauv7MYyVQ,UCYzEMRKqrh01-tauv7MYyVQ,20,Slib5XXxbjk

Strangest Ways People Died,Education,2541298,"38,020","1,070","These people died in super strange ways! In today's educational video, let's explore what happened. It’s certainly a morbid subject to discuss, but we’ve all likely talked to our friends about how we want to go out. No doubt for a lot of people dying quietly in their sleep would seem like a good option, a kind of painless, non-messy exit perhaps involving one last dream. Nobody wants to leave this planet slowly, wasting away in pain, or maybe even losing their minds. And while it might be fast, it’s likely no one would like to go out in an extremely violent way. Then there’s the ironic death, and there are plenty of those. We might recall the man in the U.S. in the 80s who avoided the electric chair after appeal and then accidentally electrocuted himself in his cell and died.

Quantum Theory Made Easy [1],People & Blogs,2109465,"23,444",856,"“Quantum Theory Made Easy,” a series in which the concepts of quantum physics are broken down for layaudiences in a more digestable manner. More in-depth than most presentations for laypersons, but without the mathematical rigour needed by a specialist in the field.So, you've heard that light is a wave/particle. Now you get to find out how we know this!In this episode, we’ll be discussing the dual nature of light, starting with a brief overview of how light was determined to be an electromagnetic wave and what properties light was classically associated with. From there, we’ll present the results of Planck’s blackbody experiments and introduce the concept of quantization, which was how this whole quantum mess was started in the first place. After explaining how the quantum of action (h) works, we’ll move on to how it showed up in experiments that challenged the wave picture of light, and how Einstein, bremsstrahlung, and Compton, made it clear that light can behave like a particle.If you enjoyed this video, please give it a like.

There are even comic series about the people who try to survive amidst zombie apocalypse! There are myriads of universes filled with these scary creatures, who also vary in type, speed, intelligence… but they all have something in common: they are all deadly, and people who face them have to do all it takes to survive.If you have ever thought about the ways to survive in case if some unknown endemic would turn half of the Earth’s population into the living dead… well, this video is definitely for you!

Luxury: Behind the mirror of high-end fashion | DW Documentary (fashion documentary),Education,1277994,"28,348",724,"This investigative documentary looks behind the shiny facade of luxury fashion. Shot with a hidden camera, it shows the brutal conditions in Chinese fur farms, and how migrants are exploited in Italian tanneries.Fine handmade bags from Gucci, Prada and Max Mara in the displays of luxurious fashion boutiques are objects of passionate desire. Luxury labels generate over 70 percent of their turnover with leather products. But hardly anyone knows the reality of their production. The major fashion brands comply with a modern code of conduct that also applies to its direct suppliers. But who controls the subcontractors? The film looks behind the beautiful displays at where the raw material comes from: tanneries in Italy, where migrants produce the leather for luxury handbags under miserable and unsafe working conditions; and behind the scenes in China’s fur animal industry, where the animals are kept under catastrophic hygienic conditions and before being cruelly slaughtered.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Trendy foods: Salmon and avocados | DW Documentary,Education,401196,"3,532",146,"Salmon and avocados are popular but there's a dark side to that trend. A lot of salmon raised on fish-farms are treated with anti-biotics which can cause health problems.  Avocado production uses a lot of water, which is bad for the environment.Salmon are usually found in the oceans of the northern hemisphere -- but they also grow well in fish farms off the coast of Chile. In the 1980s, salmon was considered a luxury, but now, it's become trendy. Avocados have also become more popular -- especially with vegans, vegetarians, and hip young people in big cities. But the mass production of salmon and avocados is causing a lot of problems.   Salmon produced on fish farms in Chile are given  massive amounts of anti-biotics. Norway, by comparison, has all but eliminated the use of them. Environmental protection laws are tougher in Norway than they are in Chile.Salmon are predatory fish -- but in Chile, they are fed largely on soybean meal. The soybeans are imported from Brazil, where they are grown on huge farms. A lot of forest in Brazil has been converted to agriculture. Also, the soy pellets that are fed to salmon in Chile have been treated with harmful substances that are banned in the EU and the US.Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados. José Gonzalez has been working in the avocado business for 35 years, and it's made him a wealthy man. But it's also changed his life dramatically, for the worse. Gonzalez has been threatened by criminals. His son was kidnapped -- and now, when Gonzalez visits his plantations, he travels with armed bodyguards.Organized crime gangs are trying to take over the avocado business, particularly in the state of Michoacán. Cartels are fighting each other for access to this ""green gold."" Violence is common, up to and including murder. Globalization and the boom in food production have now spread to Latin America, and it often has serious consequences. People and the environment are being exploited -- simply to provide food for those who live in the northern hemisphere.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Wim Hof is a Dutch world record holder, more commonly known as the Iceman, due to his unique ability to withstand extreme cold. He is best known for his twenty world records including the longest ice bath, staying immersed in ice for over 1 hour and 13 minutes.

Some of his other impressive feats are climbing to 7.3km altitude at Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts. He’s also completed a full marathon above the polar circle in Finland wearing, yes you guessed it, nothing but shorts.

Master 👉 The Typical Tactics in The Sicilian Defense 🤔 - GM Susan Polgar,People & Blogs,361004,"3,737",209,"♕ FULL COURSE:  https://www.ichess.net/shop/polgar-ch...♕ 10 GM SECRETS: https://www.ichess.net/10gmsecrets/♕MORE: https://www.ichess.net/2016/07/26/typ...In this video, GM Susan Polgar looks at a critical topic for 1.e4 and 1…c5 players: the typical tactics in the Sicilian Defense.The Sicilian Defense is one of the sharpest openings in chess, with an imbalance created straight from the beginning: White plays in the center, Black on the flank. Despite there being many variations of the Sicilian, there are also lots of similarities in each side’s formations.In this video, a preview of her Secrets of Chess Strategy (Beginner), Susan reveals some of the opening traps you need to be aware of.When either side moves their c-pawn (always Black in the Sicilian, often White too), this allows possible Qa4+/Qa5+ moves and undefended pieces are often lost to this move. Also, with only the c and d-pawns moved, Black has to be careful of Bb5+. If the Queen’s Bishop and Knight have moved, Black might have to give up his Queen.These themes and more lend themselves to more subtle combinations as revealed in this video. It’s quite easy for either side to lose a piece in the first ten moves. Knowing these patterns will help you avoid embarrassing blunders and trap a few opponents too.Susan will also show you some even more deadly attacks. Often Black’s King is somewhat smothered by the closeness of his own pieces. A well-timed sacrifice, often for a pawn on e6, can open lines for a mating attack; again, very early in the game.It pays to know about the typical tactics in the Sicilian Defense, perhaps above all other openings. Which squares become weak and why, when and where to sacrifice material and which moves to be very careful about. Watch this video and you will be well prepared to survive and profit from this opening.",PT29M3S,2016-07-26,2016-07-26,221124,iChess Channel 2,/channel/UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,19,iX9iJGrqlpQ

Turning toxic — the Bayer-Monsanto merger | DW Documentary,Education,335459,"4,351",182,"A year after Germany’s Bayer Group took over  Monsanto, and it’s struggling to deal with the US seed giant’s controversial reputation. Now Bayer is also liable for Monsanto’s legal bills - which are starting to mount alarmingly.Roundup, a herbicide containing glyphosate sold worldwide by Monsanto has long been suspected of causing cancer. A California court has just awarded more than $2 billion in damages to a couple who had claimed that their use of the pesticide caused them to develop non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma . Bayer’s share price halved last year, and the consequences are already making themselves felt in the company itself: Around 12,000 jobs worldwide are to be cut in the next few years, a considerable proportion of them in Germany. CEO Werner Baumann, who pushed for the merger, is coming under increasing pressure. Voicing criticism, a majority of shareholders voted against absolving Baumann and other managers of their responsibility in the merger. Bayer is in the midst of its greatest crisis.The film traces the effects of the merger and investigates potential new health hazards emanating from glyphosate. How has Monsanto tried in the past to influence politicians, scientists and public opinion? Did the Americans actually play down or ignore the dangers? And does Bayer really distance itself from these practices?--------------------------------------------------------------------Subscribe to DW Documentary:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39...Our other YouTube channels:DW Documental (in spanish): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocumentalDW Documentary وثائقية دي دبليو: (in arabic): https://www.youtube.com/dwdocarabiaFor more documentaries visit also:http://www.dw.com/en/tv/docfilm/s-3610Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/dwdocumentary/Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/dw.storiesDW netiquette policy: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G",PT42M26S,2019-09-11,2019-09-11,23535,DW Documentary,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,20,EwllBdC0Iww

Petrosian's Pawn Storm | Boris Spassky vs Tigran Petrosian 1966,Education,194779,"4,634",62,"This is game 7 from the 1966 World Chess Championship match between Boris Spassky, challenger, and Tigran Petrosian, champion. I recall developing a better understanding of chess as a much younger player viewing Petrosian's pawn play in this game. Spassky's decision on move 11 would prove to be a great turning point in the game which stems from a Torre Attack. With a case of opposite sides castling present, a primary factor would be the element of time. I hope you too can develop a better understanding of chess from this instructive masterpiece by Tigran Petrosian, the 9th World Chess Champion.PGN:1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bg5 d5 4.

The Future of Colonizing Space- Neil deGrasse Tyson- WGS 2018,Education,686521,"10,239",874,"Space missions need to have a defensive component or economic benefit.

The Battle of Midway 1942: Told from the Japanese Perspective (1/2),Education,7041904,"102,105","3,166","(Animated Battle Map) This is part one of a planned two-part video covering Operation MI. As you can see I spent a considerable amount of time covering Nagumo’s Dilemma. To me it's one of most striking examples of how tough it can be for a commander to make a decision based on the information at hand. I found that to be the most interesting aspect of the battle. I don’t have a Patreon but if you want to show appreciation for my work feel free to donate. » patreon -https://www.paypal.me/montemayorytcha...Corrections: ""Strength"" , ""Auxiliary"", and ""unknown"" are misspelled in the video. At 22:55 I should have stated “North of Midway” instead of Northeast of Midway. The illustration shows a 10 degree 240 nm from midway location. Not so Northeast as I audibly stated.At 23:43 I should have stated 79 aircraft instead of 78 and I should have displayed 35 instead of 34 torpedo bombers. the “mistake” came about because sources still differ on whether there were 27 or 26 Carrier attack planes (Kates). If it was 27 it would have been 79 Planes. if it was 26 it would have been 78. During the recording I somehow mixed up the numbers. Additional Notes:notice that the carriers started off the battle in a box formation. This provided further mutual support for their rather weak AA fire. however, due to the incessant air attacks from VT-8, VT-6 and VT-3, the carriers were never able to reform in a box formation, instead they were in a ragged line which further worsened their AA capabilities. -----------------------------------------Spoiler Below regarding Nagumo's Dilemma---------------------------------------------So what was the answer to Nagumo’s Dilemma?“Taking all together, and admittedly operating with the benefit of hindsight, the “right” answer to Nagumo’s conundrum probably should have emphasized maneuver, offensive speed in preference to mass, and passive damage control. With fifteen minutes in which to act, he didn’t really have time to implement anything terribly fancy. But he could have helped himself immensely by immediately spotting every strike airplane in his hangars, whether they were armed or not, and launching them at the Americans. The sixty-four armed aircraft he had in had were perfectly capable of doing enormous damage to his enemy. And by emptying his hangars, he removed the single greatest danger to his carriers --- the presence of fueled and armed aircraft within them.” Parshall, Jonathan B.; Tully, Anthony P.: Shattered Sword.

The Rise and Rise of Psychedelics | High Society,Entertainment,1082198,"21,326",917,"The UK is experiencing a psychedelic renaissance. Young people in England and Wales are taking three times more LSD than they did five years ago, scientists at top universities are claiming hallucinogens can revolutionise how we treat mental illness and the use of magic mushrooms has been increasing by around 40 percent year on year.Music festivals are awash with recreational trippers, but we also see how psychedelics have become a new health craze by attending a shamanic magic mushroom ceremony in which 50 people trip out in a London warehouse.  Despite studies showing that psychedelics are some of the safest drugs you can take, we meet one person who spilled a bottle of acid on himself and never stopped hallucinating.What is making this new generation of drug takers so interested in self-transformation?    And as the self-help trend grows, what happens when thousands of people start trying to solve their mental health problems themselves by taking powerful hallucinogens in unregulated settings?The language and content in this episode has been modified to meet YouTube's community guidelines.

I’m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I’m a physicist.Some people ask me the question, “What has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?”  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.  When I was eight, a great scientist had just died.

But what of its creator, the mild-mannered and unassuming Oxford University Math Don, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, aka. Lewis Carroll?Famed not only for his wonderful stories, Carroll is also known for his ambiguous relationship with the young girl who inspired his most beloved creation, Alice Liddell, a seemingly innocent infatuation that he documented in his pioneering photography.With contributions from the likes of thespian Richard E. Grant, social commentator Will Self and author Philip Pullman, at once adoring and provocative this documentary casts a conflicted eye over the creation of Wonderland. Pouring through historical evidence and stories passed down through generations, hear the tale of Carroll’s first encounter with the three Liddell girls and the first telling of Alice’s tumble down the rabbit hole one summer’s afternoon in a boat upon the River Thames.

Pranayama: Extend Your Life by Extending Your Breath | Jim Kambeitz | TEDxBismarck,Nonprofits & Activism,241770,"3,394",125,"Eight years ago Jim Kambeitz faced a choice: have another knee surgery or do yoga to heal and realign his joints properly. He had lost his ability to walk, so he knew that if he was to heal he’d need to commit to a serious daily practice. Months later, Jim was surprised to find that in addition to healing his knee to the point that surgery was no longer necessary, yoga transformed his life.Jim enjoys sharing the healing power of yoga and meditation as a yoga teacher and filmmaker. He has spent much of the past 20 years traveling the world, learning languages and studying under gurus from India and Europe to Brazil. He earned his Masters in Film Theory at UND and studied cinematography at the Polish National Film School. Jim and his wife, Angie, have produced three yoga DVDs, including ""Mysore Magic: Yoga at the Source,"" which is being distributed in over 60 countries.

Soon dubbed ‘Spanish Flu’ after its effects were reported in the country’s newspapers, the virus rapidly spread across much of the globe to become one of the worst natural disasters in human history. To mark the centenary and to highlight vital scientific research, the University of Cambridge has made a new film exploring what we have learnt about Spanish Flu, the urgent threat posed by influenza today, and how scientists are preparing for future pandemics.",PT11M3S,2018-11-30,2018-11-30,11433,Cambridge University,/channel/UCc5vZEM1MLUzCrg_aZIJdeA,UCc5vZEM1MLUzCrg_aZIJdeA,20,3x1aLAw_xkY
I Used Hearing Aid Secretly,Education,5631222,"108,418","7,272","I can’t believe my mom would do this again. She’s walking into the house with another brand-new designer hand bag. My dad would go ballistic if he found out she’s been spending money on purses again. My mom has a serious shopping addiction. She tries to hide it from us, but she talks to her fancy friends about it all the time. She thinks I can’t hear her because I’m deaf. Well, surprise, I can!Since I was seven years old, my hearing started to deteriorate. It’s because of a rare ear disease. By the age of ten – I was completely deaf. We tried operations and treatments, but nothing worked.I had to go to a school for students with hearing and sight disabilities. It was extremely traumatic. I had to learn sign language and reading lips. Luckily, I made a few good friends.I felt really miserable. One day, during breaktime, I fell to the ground in tears. I couldn’t believe that I would never be able to listen to music again, or hear anyone’s voice.  My friend, Rosie, pulled me to the side.  She was acting really strange. “I have a secret!” She mouthed.From her pocket she took a hearing aid. “It’s really powerful” she mouthed. “Give it a try.” At first, I was hesitant, but what did I have to lose. To my shock!  It worked! I could hear birds, and cars, I could hear Rosie laughing. It was a miracle. Rosie gave it to me and said, “keep it until you feel a  bit better.”I decided not to tell my parents about it. I was sure they knew something like this existed and they never bothered to buy me one. Also, I wanted to know if they kept anything from me. That night I could hear my parents fighting about money and purses. “I’m making all the money, and you’re spending it on handbags!” said my dad. “Oh, Honey, it doesn’t cost that much, you know that! It’s all for the show!” Even though it was really great to hear again, I didn’t like listening to my parents fighting. But nothing could prepare me for the secrets that I would find out next. That night my parents got all dressed up. My mom was showing off her new glittering designer dress and matching shoes. Off they went to a fancy dinner at some rich guy’s house. My dad was only a small shop manager, and my mother stayed at home. Where did they get all that money from?     Luckily, I was old enough and didn’t need a babysitter. I watched some TV, with the sound turned to full volume. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. I got a fright, and switched off the TV. The knock became louder and louder. I looked through the peephole, it was a lady. She seemed distressed. “It’s Mia, open up! Open up! They’re looking for me!” Everything in my body told me not to open the door. But I did it anyway. I had my sign nearby, “I can’t hear you, I’m deaf.” I showed it to the lady as she forced her way in . She was going on a total rant about purses, and something about the police, and where my parents were. She looked as though she hasn’t slept in days, I guided her to the couch.  She seemed harmless, so I made her a cup of tea and gave her some left over pizza. She said, “thank you” but I shrugged my shoulders, pretending not to know what she was saying. In a matter of moments, the lady fell asleep. She was snoring so loudly. Finally, my parents came into the house. They were arguing again. My mom said, “If you didn’t give it all away, we’d be rich by now!” to which my dad replied, “If you have just stuck to the plan, I wouldn’t have given it away.” Then they saw me, “Honey, you’re still awake?” I pointed to the sofa. My mom was completely shocked, “Mia! Mia! What are you doing here?” My dad used sign language to tell me that it was my mom’s childhood friend. Then he told me to go to my room. So, I did.I tried to listen to my parents, and what they were saying, when something really weird happened. My hearing aid started to buzz. It made these strange noises, like a radio tuning into a station. Was I picking up signals? “It doesn’t seem like Mia will be coming out of that house tonight.” I quickly jumped to look out of the window. A black SUV was standing outside. Two men were sitting in the front. It looked like one had a hand radio. I heard them talking, “Let’s go, we can catch up with her tomorrow. We don’t want them seeing us.” The SUV drove off. A few moments after the two guys left, I could see my parents and Mia walking to her car. They opened the boot and removed 5 big black bags from it. My dad said, “We’ll keep them in the safe.”",PT10M2S,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,112224,My Story Animated,/channel/UCYzEMRKqrh01-tauv7MYyVQ,UCYzEMRKqrh01-tauv7MYyVQ,20,bQfihyd99C8

I believe we should be thankful for the Atlantis orbiter, all her astronauts, the countless NASA staff who made her fly, and the American people who created a space vehicle of extraordinary power and grace.This footage incorporates numerous camera views from the ground, footage I took during launch, and video and audio from NASA showing the orbiter stack itself, during takeoff and flight -- in order to experiencing the all the preparation and the resulting eight and a half minute exhilarating ride into space.In places, the timeline of the actual events has been extended slightly to allow us to see different viewpoints of the same moment, and better experience the amazing feat of launching a spacecraft into orbit.Enjoy the ride!MORE BACKGROUND~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~After this flight, Atlantis was processed and prepared to fly one last time...  this time as ""on call"" STS-335, which would remain flight ready, should either of the remaining two orbiters flights require a rescue mission.A rescue flight was not needed and Congress, in a rare moment of clarity, appropriated enough money to extend the program to allowed the already ""flight ready"" Atlantis to launch one last time and to become the last shuttle mission of the Shuttle Program, as STS-135.Atlantis now has a home at the Kennedy Space Center.MUSIC TRACKS (In order of appearance)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1) Band Of Brothers Suite Two, Band Of Brothers, (Michael Kamen)2) Rise, The Space Between Us, (Craig Armstrong)3) After The Storm, The Space Between Us, (Craig Armstrong)4) After Antietam, Glory Soundtrack, (James Horner)5) Now We Are Free (Juba's Mix),  Gladiator: More Music From The 6) Motion Picture, (Hanz Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard)7) Hymn, The Space Between Us, (Craig Armstrong)",PT22M0S,2013-09-18,2013-09-18,142151,Jonathan Mickelson,/channel/UCqfbVnkM6T_yk9TYpIqv0Kg,UCqfbVnkM6T_yk9TYpIqv0Kg,20,5KygwcZ545U

How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals | Stephen Duneier | TEDxTucson,Nonprofits & Activism,6649071,"213,146","3,363","How you define Stephen Duneier depends on how you came to know him. Some define him as an expert institutional investor, while others know him as a large scale installation artist, avid outdoorsman, professor, decision strategist, coach, business leader, mindfulness extremist, author, speaker, daredevil or Guinness world record holder. In his talk, Stephen explains that what truly defines him aren't titles, but an approach to decision making that transformed him from someone who struggled with simple tasks to a guy who is continuously achieving even his most ambitious dreams.For thirty years, he has applied cognitive science to investing, business and life. The result has been the turnaround of numerous institutional businesses, career best returns for managers who have adopted his methods, the development of a $1.25 billion dollar hedge fund and a rapidly shrinking bucket list.Mr. Duneier teaches graduate courses on Decision Analysis in UCSB’s College of Engineering. His book, AlphaBrain is due for release in early 2017 from Wiley & Sons.Through Bija Advisors, he helps business leaders improve performance by applying proven, proprietary decision-making methods to their own processes.His artwork has been featured around the world and is represented by the Sullivan Goss Gallery. As Commissioner of the League of Professional Educators, Duneier is using cognitive science to alter the landscape of American education. He is the former Head of Currency Option Trading at Bank of America and Emerging Markets at AIG International.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Through a suicide attempt, I was introduced to recovery. Recovery introduced me to me. Someone I had never met. Once I was introduced to me, it was important that I formulate the best romance ever and find a way to give to myself what I had been responsible for giving to others all of my life, hope. Once I learned how to give it to me and always keep just enough to give to another woman, my sisters, my eyes and ears. I began living a life with a purpose. It's the best love story ever.Telling my everyday story may inspire someone to share that she needs help with addiction, or give someone the freedom to share that she too is living a life of recovery. To shatter the stigma associated with drug addiction and recovery.Professional, engaged, mommy. Intelligent, articulate and funny. Sincere, compassionate and giving.

This, inevitably, makes it tough to quantify and rank with any real authority. While happiness is said to come from within, residents in several nations are perceived to experience it more widely than in other countries. The happiness of citizens does not increase when their country’s overall wealth increases. This year’s ranking criteria has also seen some changes. It focuses on happiness and the community. European countries dominate a ranking of nations seen as the happiest in the 2019 Best Countries report.

Kicking and Screaming: WSJ’s Kim Strassel on the Media vs. Trump,News & Politics,993734,"17,473","1,803","Recorded on April 9, 2020.As a columnist for the Wall Street Journal and a commentator for Fox News, Kim Strassel is a card-carrying member of the mainstream media. But Strassel is appalled by the media’s treatment of Donald Trump, and not just from journalists from the left. She describes the “resistance” in detail in her recent book, Resistance (at All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America. She and Peter Robinson discuss the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 crisis and the way the media has covered it and disseminated the information to the public. They also discuss the upcoming presidential election (yes, we are still having one) and the politics of the $2 trillion stimulus bill, with more spending on the way, and the realities of restarting the economy in a post- or partial-post-COVID-19 world. Finally, they discuss the pluses and minuses of Donald Trump’s temperament, and the possibility of something good coming from this current crisis.

Designing Your Life | Bill Burnett | TEDxStanford,Nonprofits & Activism,1958516,"23,137",827,"Executive director of Stanford’s design program at the d.School, Bill Burnett uses design thinking, a career’s worth of starting companies and coaching students, and a childhood spent drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother’s sewing machine to inform his work on how to design your life. In five eyebrow-raising findings, Burnett offers simple but life-changing advice on designing the life you want, whether you are contemplating college or retirement. After years of drawing cars and airplanes under his Grandmother’s sewing machine, Bill Burnett went to college where he discovered that there were people in the world who did this kind of thing every day (without the sewing machine), and they were called designers. Thirty years, five companies, and a couple thousand students later, Burnett is still drawing and building things, teaching others how to do the same, and quietly enjoying the fact that no one has discovered that he is having too much fun. As Executive Director of the Design Program at Stanford, he runs undergraduate and graduate programs in design, both interdepartmental programs between the mechanical engineering and art departments. Burnett worked on design of the award-winning Apple PowerBooks and the original Hasbro Star Wars action figures. He holds a number of mechanical and design patents.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Their design makes the stealth aircraft almost invisible to enemy location systems and thus gives them a decisive advantage. Even modern military ships such as the USS Zumwalt camouflage themselves in this way - their unusual shape and a special coating disperse enemy radar beams. How will stealth technology develop?

Parents be warned.TEDxTeen opening music by BlackDoeAnn Makosinski is an 18 year-old student, innovator and entrepreneur. Her first toy was a box of transistors. From there, her interest in science and creating arose. One of her friends in the Philippines got a failing grade because she didn't have any electricity or light to study with at night. As a potential solution, Ann invented a flashlight that ran off the heat of the human hand - the Hollow Flashlight. The invention won her age category at the 2013 Google Science Fair, as well as numerous awards at the Intel Science and Engineering Fair. She appeared on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and was named one of TIMES 30 Under 30. Ann hopes to manufacture her flashlight, bringing the invention to developing countries and including them in emergency kits. Ann also invented the eDrink - a coffee mug that harvests the excess heat of your hot drink and converts it into electricity to charge a phone. Ann debuted the eDrink this October on her second appearance on the Tonight Show.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

New rules are springing up on a daily basis and the government depends on loyal party members to enforce these measures at grassroots level.

Social media platforms are one of the few ways to remain in touch with the outside world.  Some brave bloggers are using these channels to share their experiences of the crisis.

The director of the Bangladesh Central Bank got off the elevator on the ninth floor, and headed to the back office of the Accounts and Budgeting Department - this was the most restricted part of the building. He was there to deal with a problem; one that had been plaguing the office the last few days. You see… the printer wasn’t working; this was kind of a big deal. It was causing a real disruption. The automated printer (which was hooked up to the bank’s software) was supposed to work round the clock, 24/7, printing out the bank’s transaction reports in real-time; due to this technical glitch however, the printer tray remained empty. Much of the day was spent trying to fix the issue; and after a great deal of effort, there was success - they were able to restart the printer. And so the backlog of transaction reports started rolling out, one by one. Now, it soon became apparent that something wasn’t quite right. There were more statements than expected....The video covers:- Bangladesh Bank- SWIFT security system- World banking- Fraudulent transactions- Dhaka- Billion dollar heist- Cyber-heist / cyber-attack- RCBC Bank in Philippines- Malware hacking- Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed)- Electronic money transfers- Pan Asia Bank in Sri Lanka- Deutsche Bank- Money laundering in casinos- Single biggest heist in history- Cyber security experts- Lazarus- Sony Pictures Hack 2014- Kim Jong-un in The Interview- North Korea's state funded bank robbing- Macau's & Pyongyang's financial relationship",PT14M44S,2018-08-06,2018-08-06,113233,Kento Bento,/channel/UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,19,Usu9z0feHug

Heather Mac Donald On How The Delusion of Diversity Destroys Our Common Humanity,News & Politics,574391,"19,996",526,"Recorded on February 25, 2019.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/heath...Is the dedication to diversity undermining American culture? In her book The Diversity Delusion, Heather Mac Donald argues that the focus on race and gender diversity is harming society. Mac Donald and Peter Robinson discuss how she was protested off of school campuses by students because of her ideas. They discuss the collapse of free-speech ideals on college campuses in the United States and how the dedication to diversity doesn’t extend to a diversity of thought. Mac Donald also breaks down issues of gender and racial equality. She talks about how affirmative action has not had the impact that was intended and has in fact made attending college more difficult for minorities who are accepted to schools they are not ready for. She also goes on to analyze rape culture on college campuses and posits her theories as to why discussions of sexual violence have become more prevalent now than in the past.

I guarantee, that this will be the best motivational video that you will see today, It’s not like the “Fake” motivational videos out there on YouTube. It’s literally impossible, to not be motivated if you implement this habit. We all struggle with motivation from time to time, it’s not bad to admit this. But it is bad, to allow yourself to stay unmotivated. There are many people who talk about motivation, as if it’s something that you get. But we have to realize, that motivation is just an emotion, and all emotions are transient, meaning they come and they go. So, you can rely on motivation, because it comes and it goes. Implementing this strategy will also force you to be self disciplined, because you really do have no other option.

"Own Your Behaviours, Master Your Communication, Determine Your Success | Louise Evans | TEDxGenova",Nonprofits & Activism,2520622,"64,593","1,423","This speech is a call to action. We spend about eighty percent of our day at work, the rest is at home. If we have a bad day at work we are likely to take that negativity home with us and vice versa. It is of paramount importance that we create healthy environments in the spaces that most affect our lives by giving of our best and receiving the like in return. The 5 Chairs is a powerful and systematic method which helps us master our own behaviours and manage the behaviours of others. To be a good leader is to contribute to the success and happiness of everyone, at work and at home, on a conscious level. The 5 Chairs offer 5 Choices. Which will you choose?Behavioral Coach, Corporate Trainer, Author of ‘5 Chairs 5 Choices’. Louise Evans heads up her own organization in Florence, Italy from which she offers international leadership development, cross-cultural transitional coaching and personal development programmes for individuals and teams working in international contexts. She is English but has lived and worked in Germany, France and for the last 30 years in Italy. Three things have always been important in her life - people, travel and the performing arts - all three of which she combines in her daily work. Having travelled to seven-five countries and experienced culture shock three times, Louise brings multiple perspectives to the present moment to help people connect across their differences. Louise believes deeply in people’s ability to grow and transform. What she values most is helping people strengthen their self-awareness and their understanding of others so that they bring their best selves into the world in every situation.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Victor Davis Hanson on “The Case For Trump”,News & Politics,2470735,"28,556","2,093","Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump’s “personal authenticity” during the campaign and how the media has a “historical amnesia” of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump’s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn’t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California’s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that’s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

Electrical Engineer vs World Chess Champion | Mikhail Botvinnik - Alexander Alekhine 1938,Education,94273,"2,643",43,"The AVRO chess tournament of 1938 was the strongest tournament ever held up to that time. Mikhail Botvinnik was one of the few chess players to achieve a career in another field (Electrical Engineering) while also competing at a world-class chess level. Botvinnik was already an accomplished chess player, and would a decade later build his resume by becoming the 6th world chess champion. Botvinnik's opponent Alexander Alekhine was the current World Chess Champion (4th). The board saw the Queen's Gambit Declined, Semi-Tarrasch quickly arrive at a technical position, remaining as such until both players would shake hands. If you're a chess teacher, this instructional game is likely a good candidate to consider sharing with your students for its many technical and teachable moments.PGN:1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 e6 4.

Unlike his other children, Donald Trump has given Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner official positions in the West Wing, which means the scrutiny surrounding their personal history is even more heightened. Not only are there several photos of them together in positions that are not typical for a father and a daughter, but Donald Trump has also publicly spoken of her in terms that many find to be totally inappropriate.

Mikhail Tal takes his opponent into a deep dark forest,Education,654530,"11,517",267,"In 1957, Mikhail Tal played a training game that sparkled of tactics against his trainer, Alexander Koblents. The Magician from Riga met Koblents's Sicilian Defense with the Richter-Rauzer Attack. In a game of opposite sides castling, initiative is king and Tal understood this game element likely better than anyone else. It's impressive to observe so many of Tal's pieces in jeopardy, yet they cannot all be taken in just one move of course, or even be safely captured without negative consequence. One of Tal's most famous chess quotes is ""You must take your opponent into a deep, dark forest where 2+2=5 and the path leading out is only wide enough for one."" Mikhail Tal certainly took Alexander Koblents into the forest, and what resulted was one highly complex masterpiece of a game. Mikhail Tal quite simply is one of the best, if not the best, tactical geniuses to have ever played the game.PGN:1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cd4 4. Nd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 e6 7. Qd2 Be7 8.

The power of forgiveness | Sammy Rangel | TEDxDanubia,Nonprofits & Activism,263508,"5,258",103,"""We do not have to be victims of our own stories...but interestingly enough stories are a way out [our suffering]. We hold the power to change our story."" Sammy Rangel ended his ted talk leaving the stage with a standing ovation. He shared some stories of his childhood which was filled with so much abuse and neglect that it's hard not to empathize with story of what lead him to a 7 year prison sentence in solitary confinement.Sammy is the founder of Formers Anonymous, a self-help group for criminals and addicts who are looking for support on how to change and recover from their addictive behavior. His story is extraordinary – being a victim of childhood physical, mental and sexual abuse, he lived most of his juvenile life as a homeless throwaway child, who very quickly encountered drugs, crime, sex, and violence in the street. He has enhanced his credibility by overcoming addiction and recovering from a life of gangs, violence and maximum-security prison to become a college-graduate, a street-savvy counselor, a mentor and now a father of four. Having graduated with Presidential honours and Summa Cum Laude, Sammy holds a Master of Social Work Degree and has earned several awards. His autobiographical book, FOURBEARS: The Myths of Forgiveness is not simply a graphically illustrated memoir, but also a ‘manual’, as it goes in depth concerning the steps it takes to forgive, change and recover.

10 Morning Habits That Can Ruin Your Day,Howto & Style,5298317,"106,145","2,965","Wake up on the wrong side of the bed this morning? Perhaps it’s because you’re guzzling down a bunch of coffee or jumping in a hot shower right after you wake up? Or maybe when you first open your eyes in the morning, you can’t fight the urge to see what’s new on social media? These may not be the best ways to start your morning.Old habits die hard, that’s why we do some things without even thinking about how harmful they are — especially in the morning when we don’t have time to spare. So today, Bright Side wants to talk about ten things many of us do every morning that are actually harmful to us. You’ll learn how to make your morning and the day that follows better than they ever were before.Other videos you might like:7 Morning Habits That Stop You from Losing Weight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5LDR...I Drank Water on an Empty Stomach for a Month, and This Happened https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UgL_...What Will Happen If You Start Eating Oats Every Day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJLX...TIMESTAMPS: Hitting the snooze button 0:32Checking your phone 1:38Drinking coffee first thing 2:33Not making the bed 3:40Eating empty carbs and sugar for breakfast 4:19Leaving the curtains closed 5:11Saving stretches and exercises for the evening 5:58Brushing your teeth after breakfast 7:15Making phone calls 7:49Taking a hot shower 8:33Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY:- Smashing that snooze button is a sure-fire way to start your day off all wrong. That’s because when you fall back asleep in between alarms, you enter into a new sleep cycle without completing it. This makes you feel even more groggy and disoriented than you did when you awoke to your first alarm.- While this is a very common morning habit for most of us, looking at your phone right after you open your eyes can cause you to feel unnecessary stress and anxiety before you even get up to brush your teeth!- While there isn’t anything wrong with enjoying a steaming cup o’ joe in the morning, this shouldn’t be the first thing you sip on after waking up.- By making your bed every morning, you’re completing a healthy ritual that will carry on into your day. You’ll be more productive and motivated to tackle the day ahead!- Opt for a protein-rich breakfast. This will keep you fuller for longer and, it’ll give you long-lasting energy to keep you productive and focused all day long!- According to life coach Kirkland Shave, natural sunlight releases cortisol in the body, which helps you concentrate and make smart decisions throughout the day.- Don’t do any strenuous exercising or stretching first thing in the morning, though. You can hurt yourself since your muscles and discs aren’t warmed up yet.- Brushing your teeth after breakfast may do more harm than good. You see, if you’ve consumed something acidic like coffee or fruit, that acid thins the enamel of your teeth. So, brushing them right after can wear away that weakened enamel.- People need time to wake up and get their bearings before they can think about important things to talk about on the phone. It’s best to wait until about 9:30am to start making phone calls.- The cold makes your brain release feel-good endorphins and natural adrenaline. If you can’t stomach a cold shower, at least take a lukewarm one.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCPhotos: https://www.depositphotos.comEast News----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",PT10M1S,2019-01-27,2019-01-27,112313,BRIGHT SIDE,/channel/UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,19,YzzLUw6KGlc

Antarctica at one time was not covered with ice, and could have been home to ancient humans. As we develop new methods for uncovering the ice, we are beginning to see the possibilities that lay below. Mainstream ideology puts forward the ""Out of Africa"" theory, which tracks humans originating in Africa and spreading out by land across the world. However, genetic research is finding evidence that makes our story far more complex. One of these findings is the discovery of the Denisovan people of Siberia, which reveals an entirely new, intelligent human subspecies (first discovered in 2008). It is findings like this, that cause us to have to rewrite human history.

These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

How the rich get richer – money in the world economy | DW Documentary,Education,4561623,"39,209","2,606","Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market – the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? For years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: ""This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Tesla held over 300 patents and is responsible for inventing the laser, x-ray, radio, Tesla coil, Tesla turbine, neon signs, induction motor, remote control and many more. Tesla was a brilliant mind, but did not focus his energy on monetizing his inventions and had difficulty socializing. He died alone in a small hotel in New York.

"1177 BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Eric Cline, PhD)",Science & Technology,4032316,"46,503","2,549","From about 1500 BC to 1200 BC, the Mediterranean region played host to a complex cosmopolitan and globalized world-system. It may have been this very internationalism that contributed to the apocalyptic disaster that ended the Bronze Age. When the end came, the civilized and international world of the Mediterranean regions came to a dramatic halt in a vast area stretching from Greece and Italy in the west to Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia in the east. Large empires and small kingdoms collapsed rapidly. With their end came the world’s first recorded Dark Ages. It was not until centuries later that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting the stage for the evolution of Western society as we know it today.  Professor Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University will explore why the Bronze Age came to an end and whether the collapse of those ancient civilizations might hold some warnings for our current society.Considered for a Pulitzer Prize for his recent book 1177 BC, Dr. Eric H. Cline is Professor of Classics and Anthropology and the current Director of the Capitol Archaeological Institute at The George Washington University. He is a National Geographic Explorer, a Fulbright scholar, an NEH Public Scholar, and an award-winning teacher and author. He has degrees in archaeology and ancient history from Dartmouth, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania; in May 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree (honoris causa) from Muhlenberg College.  Dr. Cline is an active field archaeologist with 30 seasons of excavation and survey experience.The views expressed in this video are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Capital Area Skeptics.",PT70M18S,2016-10-11,2016-10-11,141325,NCASVideo,/channel/UCV62FVLw6MxUvO8XmnhE4Yw,UCV62FVLw6MxUvO8XmnhE4Yw,20,bRcu-ysocX4

PART 2: Inspector General FISA Investigation President Trump - Senate Hearing,News & Politics,536144,"5,033",463,"The U.S. attorney who is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of the origins of the Trump-Russia probe released a rare statement Monday saying he disagrees with conclusions of the so-called FISA report -- after DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz found in that review that the probe's launch largely complied with DOJ and FBI policies.“Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened,” U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a statement.Horowitz released his report Monday saying his investigators found no intentional misconduct or political bias surrounding efforts to launch that 2016 probe and to seek a highly controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in the early months of the investigation. Still, it found that there were ""significant concerns with how certain aspects of the investigation were conducted and supervised.""“I have the utmost respect for the mission of the Office of Inspector General and the comprehensive work that went into the report prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff,” Durham said. “However, our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department. Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.”As Horowitz has conducted his review of DOJ actions during the Russia probe, Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, has also been conducting a wider inquiry into alleged misconduct and alleged improper government surveillance on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.Fox News reported in October that Durham's ongoing probe has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation.Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr ripped the FBI’s “intrusive” investigation after the release of Horowitz’s review, saying it was launched based on the “thinnest of suspicions.”“The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,” Barr said in a statement.Barr expressed frustration that the FBI continued investigating the Trump campaign, even as “exculpatory” information came to the light.",PT190M52S,2019-12-11,2019-12-11,21115,FOX 10 Phoenix,/channel/UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,20,4EaDJgoyLAw

This experience takes us on a journey to the end of time, trillions of years into the future, to discover what the fate of our planet and our universe may ultimately be. We start in 2019 and travel exponentially through time, witnessing the future of Earth, the death of the sun, the end of all stars, proton decay, zombie galaxies, possible future civilizations, exploding black holes, the effects of dark energy, alternate universes, the final fate of the cosmos - to name a few.This is a picture of the future as painted by modern science - a picture that will surely evolve over time as we dig for more clues to how our story will unfold. Much of the science is very recent - and new puzzle pieces are still waiting to be found.To me, this overhead view of time gives a profound perspective - that we are living inside the hot flash of the Big Bang, the perfect moment to soak in the sights and sounds of a universe in its glory days, before it all fades away.  Although the end will eventually come, we have a practical infinity of time to play with if we play our cards right. The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species.

There are literally 1000's of success books out there, so why should this one be any different? Stephen Covey researched the last 200 years of success literature and found something interesting.. In the last 50 years, most of the books have been focused on the personality ethic - Things like public image, how you dress, how you perform in social interactions, positive mental attitude, skills and techniques to get people to behave in certain ways. These books focus on how to appear rather than how to actually be. The 7 habits of highly effective people takes an inside out approach – it focuses on the character ethic rather than the personality ethic.1 - be proactive2 - begin with the end in mind3 - put first things first4 - think win win 5 - seek first to understand then to be understood6 - synergy7 - sharpen the sawWisdom for life Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/Wisdom-For-L...Check out my blog: https://russjamieson.comHaving issues with shyness and social anxiety?https://socialanxietymentor.com/",PT13M19S,2018-01-07,2018-01-07,112345,WISDOM FOR LIFE,/channel/UCTQgz1HeKoCMayrsyOJTdQw,UCTQgz1HeKoCMayrsyOJTdQw,19,WFc08j9eorQ

"HOW TO CONVERT A LIABILITY INTO AN ASSET - ROBERT KIYOSAKI, Rich Dad Poor Dad",Education,2728334,"53,526","1,584","Your house, 401K and IRA are NOT assets. In this video I will be teaching you the  basic fundamentals of financial education. Along with the difference between an asset and liability so you can learn to control the direction of your cash flow. So many athletes find themselves making millions and then in a couple years they are BROKE. This is because the traditional education system does not teach you basic financial literacy or how to control your cash flow. Best known as the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad—the #1 personal finance book of all time—Robert Kiyosaki has challenged and changed the way tens of millions of people around the world think about money. He is an entrepreneur, educator, and investor who believes that each of us has the power to makes changes in our lives, take control of our financial future, and live the rich life we deserve. With perspectives on money and investing that often contradict conventional wisdom, Robert has earned an international reputation for straight talk, irreverence, and courage and has become a passionate and outspoken advocate for financial education. Robert’s most recent books—Why the Rich Are Getting Richer and More Important Than Money—were published in the spring of this year to mark the 20th Anniversary of the 1997 release of Rich Dad Poor Dad. That book and its messages, viewed around the world as a classic in the personal finance arena, have stood the test of time. Why the Rich Are Getting Richer, released two decades after the international blockbuster bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad, is positioned as Rich Dad Graduate School. Robert has also co-authored two books with Donald Trump, prior to his successful bid for the White House and election as President of the United States.#robertkiyosaki #richdadpoordad #millennialmoneyhttp://www.richdad.comFacebook: @RobertKiyosakihttps://www.facebook.com/RobertKiyosaki/Twitter: @TheRealKiyosakihttps://twitter.com/theRealKiyosakiInstagram: @TheRealKiyosakihttps://www.instagram.com/therealkiyo...",PT14M5S,2018-03-30,2018-03-30,112343,The Rich Dad Channel,/channel/UCuifm5ns5SRG8LZJ6gCfKyw,UCuifm5ns5SRG8LZJ6gCfKyw,19,A8vD_XO0vUU

The power of breath: Christian de la Huerta at TEDxCoMo,Education,178648,"1,677",95,"What does the way we breathe tell us about ourselves? What feedback does it provide about our state of being?

Enter the cult of extreme productivity | Mark Adams | TEDxHSG,Nonprofits & Activism,1996293,"32,007","2,783","In this talk Mark shares a dramatic and powerful system that takes productivity thinking to whole new and terrifying level, allowing a person to achieve almost any goal they set themselves with rapid speed. The secret to this type of exponential success? Bin your ‘affirmations’ and ‘goals’ and instead embrace fear as your friend by making irreversible decisions. Instead of hapless resolutions members of the ""Lock-In"" cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences). The “Lock-In"" system harnesses our most primal evolutionary instinct - to avoid pain - and uses it to radically supercharge our lives. Many of the most successful people in history have used its phenomenal power to create extraordinary success. Think you're hardcore enough? Then enter the Cult of Extreme Productivity Mark Adams is Vice President and Head of Innovation at VICE, which has come from humble beginnings as a print magazine to digitally transform into a 5 billion dollar youth media empire. In this talk, Mark describes the cult of extreme productivity that he became part of alongside his brother. The cult is all about making irreversible decisions that make “manifesting” your dreams the only option because not achieving it would create indescribable suffering. This is the second time Mark has done a TEDx talk. The first time his talk was banned. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

"Energy hunger, blackouts and energy providers (1/2) | DW Documentary",Education,268201,"2,629",200,"Our hunger for energy goes beyond all limits and will double in the next 20 years. But what available technologies could meet the growing thirst for electricity? And will we also have to cut power consumption? What can Europe learn from China? And could ""decentralization"" into so-called ""microgrids"" the future of energy?You can watch part 2 here: https://youtu.be/eHmp7_r1PG8What is supposed to be the largest and most efficient solar power plant in the world is currently being built near the Moroccan desert city of Ouarzazate. The Noor solar power plant, which means ""Light"" in Arabic, is due to be completed by 2020, when it will comprise 4 units. In its final expansion stage, Noor will supply a total of 1.3 million households with electricity. The sun is the most powerful source of energy in our galaxy and could theoretically supply all of humanity with electricity with ease, but what technologies do we have to usher in this new era of electricity? Could wind power be a more promising alternative? Wind farms are being built at full speed around the world, but is wind energy really viable? Is the enormous investment in wind turbines at all worth it and can it meet our demand for electricity? China has shown how quickly you can push ahead with the switch from fossil to renewable energy sources. China's enormous economic growth in recent decades has made the Middle Kingdom the world's largest energy guzzler. But China is also the world’s largest energy producer. A veritable energy revolution is currently underway. Almost 20 percent of the ever-growing demand for energy is now met by renewable technologies, and a large proportion of the solar cells used worldwide already come from China. What can Europe learn from China? One key to avoiding an electricity crisis could be ""decentralization,” so-called ""microgrids."" A quiet little town in the Swabian Allgäu region has shown it is possible to produce eight times as much electricity as it needs itself.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Did Amy Klobuchar Send an Innocent Teenager to Life in Prison? Questions Mount over Her Record as DA,News & Politics,198854,"6,895",165,"After a surprising third-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar is attempting to gain ground in the national polls. But Klobuchar is also facing mounting scrutiny over her record as a district attorney in Minnesota. The Minneapolis NAACP, Black Lives Matter Twin Cities and other racial justice groups recently called on Klobuchar to suspend her presidential campaign following a shocking investigation by the Associated Press. The AP report centered on the case of Myon Burrell, an African-American teenager who was sentenced to life in prison over the 2002 murder of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards. Klobuchar led the case against Myon Burrell when she was Hennepin County’s district attorney, but the AP report says she may have mishandled the case and that Burrell could be innocent. The Associated Press report shows how prosecutors had no DNA or fingerprints tying Burrell to the murder and that they relied on jailhouse informants, some of whom have since recanted their testimonies. Burrell has always maintained his innocence. On the campaign trail, Klobuchar has cited the jailing of Burrell as one of her achievements and brought up the conviction during a debate in September. We speak with Nekima Levy Armstrong, civil rights attorney, activist, head of the Racial Justice Network and former president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP. “It’s shocking at this point that Amy Klobuchar is still in the race for president of the United States, given the significance of Myon Burrell’s case,” she says.#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Hürtgen forest and the end of World War II | Free Full DW Documentary,Education,145316,"2,456",86,"Thousands of soldiers were killed in the last battles of World War II. US troops who fought in the Hürtgen Forest nicknamed it the ""Death Factory."" This documentary features original film from US archives that bring the battle back to life.It's estimated that as many as 30 thousand US and German soldiers were killed in fighting in the northern Eifel region of Germany in the autumn and winter of 1944 and 1945. Traces of the battle - old bunkers, munitions, trenches and tank tracks - are still visible even today. The scarred landscape bears witness to a little-known chapter of World War Two. The ""Hürtgen Forest"" was the last obstacle standing between US forces and the Rhine River and Ruhr. Yet the decision to advance into the thick forest in September 1944 proved to be a fatal mistake. The Americans completely miscalculated North Eifel region's rugged terrain. They became disoriented in an area the German forces, the Wehrmacht, had crisscrossed with trenches and peppered with anti-personnel mines, making the wood into a veritable fortress. Continual rain and fog, followed by snow and frigid temperatures, turned the battle into a scene of dystopian butchery. Author Ernest Hemingway spent 18 days on the front in the Hürtgen Forest. He wrote later, ""It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there."" This documentary reconstructs the stages of the battle using commentary from survivors of the clash. Among them are the well-known US photographer Tony Vaccaro, US Army veteran James K. Cullen and former Wehrmacht soldier Paul Verbeek.

How to Have a Good Conversation | Celeste Headlee | TEDxCreativeCoast,Nonprofits & Activism,5184786,"131,847","2,451","When your job hinges on how well you talk to people, you learn a lot about how to have great conversations – and most of us don’t converse very well. A great conversation requires a balance between talking and listening. This balance is important because bad communication leads to bad relationships, at home, at work, everywhere.Celeste Headlee has worked in public radio since 1999, as a reporter, host, and correspondent. She was the Midwest Correspondent for NPR before becoming the co-host of the PRI show The Takeaway. She also guest hosted a number of NPR shows including Tell Me More, Talk of the Nation, Weekend All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition.

Bf7 Bg3 45. c5The name Bobby Fischer, at least to Americans, is synonymous with chess. A prodigy in the 50s, a world class player in the 60s, the 70s saw Fischer at his pinnacle. He earned the right to challenge Boris Spassky in a title run without comparison, defeating Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen with perfect scores of 6-0, and ex-champion Petrosian 6½-2½. Now the stage was set, and the only thing standing between Fischer and Spassky was Fischer himself.The match was mired in political overtones, during the height of the Cold War. The Soviet chess system had a monopoly on the title since 1948, and the expectations on Spassky were enormous. While Fischer studied chess virtually in seclusion, Spassky had the full resources of the USSR. Victor Baturinsky, head of Soviet Chess Sports Committee, said: ""Basically, the Soviet leadership and the powers that be in sport, were interested in just one issue: how to stop Fischer from becoming World Champion.With the match set to begin in Reykjavik, Iceland, Fischer (who had not signed any documents confirming his participation) began to make a number of demands, including a percentage of television rights, a larger prize fund, and all manner of conditions covering everything from the lighting to the chair cushions. To satisfy Bobby's demands of a larger prize fund, British chess promoter James Slater donated a dazzling $125,000 to be added to the prize fund. Fischer still needed more convincing by Bill Lombardy (Fischer's last-minute choice as second), and one famously persuasive telephone call from Henry Kissinger. Mere hours before he would be forfeited, Fischer arrived in Iceland.Read more here: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess....----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.Link to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmatorBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7Nano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoqCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.ac...Check out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5...Steemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...Twitter: https://twitter.com/agadmatorInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/Lichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmatorChess.com: agadmatorLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)Blizzard: agadmator #2992 Check out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKe...Check out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0...Send your photos and videos here:subscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com#agadmator #bobbyfischer #bobbyfischerstory",PT22M13S,2018-09-25,2018-09-25,221251,agadmator's Chess Channel,/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,18,XPVk_Yhqs48

Who was Karl Marx? | DW Documentary,Education,1082792,"9,605","1,791","2018 marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of German philosopher and Communist icon Karl Marx. Is Karl Marx still relevant in the 21st century?Philosopher, historian and economist Karl Marx is a name that’s back on everyone's lips. The documentary explores the ongoing impact of his writings in Europe and China. How should we approach the legacy of someone who - like few others before or since - not only changed the world, but divided it as well? Even though not everyone accepts his ideas, Marx's analyses and theories motivated many people to take political action. We meet activists, witnesses and experts - individuals who are able to illuminate Karl Marx's impact from the Russian revolution until today. Even in the 21st century, two hundred years after his birth, Marx has lost none of his relevance. After the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe and the end of the Cold War in 1989 and 1990, the sun seemed to be setting on Marx. But during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, when the contradictions of capitalism were once more laid bare, Marx was resurrected as an icon. His theories and ideas are now enjoying something of a renaissance at universities, churches, and conferences, and in mainstream broadcast and print media. The Chinese have even donated a larger-than-life statue of Marx to the city of his birth, Trier. This thought-provoking documentary does not shy away from controversy. As well providing insight into Karl Marx’s life and work, it investigates what appealed to past and present advocates of his philosophies, bringing the story to life with a rich trove of archive material._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

The Mindset for Healthy Eating | Gillian Riley | TEDxChelmsford,Nonprofits & Activism,344968,"5,476",277,"In order to eat less, most think prohibitively: “I’m allowed these, but not those” or “I mustn’t eat any more.” This can create a disastrous relationship with food; perhaps complying initially, only to rebel later. Instead of obeying rules, what works is a strong sense of freedom… then making choices.Gillian Riley is an author whose work focuses on the mindset behind overeating. She teaches techniques that break patterns of eating behavior, delivering control that lasts. Weight loss, when appropriate, is one of many benefits.Motivated by the effectiveness of this approach, she’s inspired by the practical application of the theory into the everyday lives of those who struggle with food.Based in Leicestershire, she has a worldwide clientele. Gillian has been delivering her EATING LESS seminars in London since 1997, and is currently creating an online version. Her books, EATING LESS, DITCHING DIETS and WILLPOWER are steady bestsellersThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Are we alone? Chapter 1 of this experience takes you to alien worlds and distant places in time and space, in search of where alien life might be hiding and what our place is within the history of life.  After generations of wondering, the truth is finally within our reach.  New research and technologies have brought us closer than ever to an answer - only a few decades in the eyes of some NASA scientists.The search has led to new discoveries that will blow your mind wide open and give a profound new perspective on human life. The deeper we look, the deeper we see into nature's imagination, and the more we learn about ourselves.  I hope stewing on these thoughts tickles your brain as deeply as it does mine. In upcoming chapters of Life Beyond we will explore making contact with intelligent life, the potential physics of alien biology, how to survive the end of the universe, and more.

SpaceX Falcon Heavy- Elon Musk's Engineering Masterpiece,Science & Technology,4436659,"88,556","2,328","Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 22 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight, carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off, the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today, doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor.Within three minutes, the Falcon Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads.Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster, carrying a passenger—sort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company’s new spacesuit would ride in the driver’s seat of the electric sports car ,nicknamed Starman.MUSIC CREDITS:-  ""Hero Memories"" by Really Slow MotionComposer: Fran SotoAlbum: SigmaYoutube link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSgjJ...Buy Really Slow Motion musicAmazon : http://amzn.to/1lTltY5iTunes: http://bit.ly/1ee3l8KSpotify: http://bit.ly/1r3lPvNBandcamp: http://bit.ly/1DqtZSoFOOTAGE CREDITS:-00:00-00:06 00:35-00:41 01:33-01:35 The Vergechannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVergevideo link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7LJI...00:47-00:49 & 03:25- Anthony Garciachannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJc...video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhhPs...01:19-01:20 03:13-03:15-bombcat91Channel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aW...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znVWV...01:22-01:24- videodroneChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Kz...video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGbH...03:11- The cooper ScoopChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOKR...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncSDV...Footage at 03:26-03:28 & voice at 03:23-03:37-Das valdez(KSpace Academy)Twitch: http://twitch.tv/dasvaldezYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLd...Full Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw3KE...03:28-03:30- Physics AnonymousChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzu3...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tikak...03:32-Emmerich Video ProductionsChannel Link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkP...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMCC0...Elon Musk's Statement courtesy:- 00:20-00:34- The Verge00:46-00:54- CNNMoney#ElonMusk #SpaceX #FalconHeavy",PT4M27S,2018-07-13,2018-07-13,142155,Spaceflight TV,/channel/UCmT2GQ-ev5aoYXNU4joElLQ,UCmT2GQ-ev5aoYXNU4joElLQ,20,sX1Y2JMK6g8

Are you ready to fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ‘explosive’ journey?In his talk, Andrew aims to promote chemistry as the science of remarkable changes, which are often overlooked yet so important in our everyday life. And he does it brilliantly by performing an incredible series of 25 experiments in 15 minutes, totally amazing the audience (who rewards him with a long and deserved standing ovation)! Andrew Z. Szydło is an internationally acclaimed chemistry teacher. But he’s definitely not the typical chemistry teacher you would expect…He holds a PhD in the History and Philosophy of Science from UCL, and is an expert on the history of alchemy (his 1994 book ‘Water Which Does Not Wet Hands’ is considered to be the standard reference work on the Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius.)But his polymath spirit extends further: he’s a violin, bugle and accordion player, as well as a professional photographer. Throughout the years Andrew has wowed audiences all around the world with his pyrotechnical approach to teaching and demonstrating chemical sciences on stage and has appeared many times on TV. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

He was even submerged into ice on the TEDxAmsterdam stage in 2010. He was a medical mystery, but not anymore. His body and technique became a subject for scientific research. In this talk he shares what he tought science, that his technique can help others attain results that were former mysteries and what the implications are.By the time Wim reached his teenage years, he was already running barefoot through the snow, comfortably.. It was the beginning of a large series of confrontations with the cold, where every single time, limits were tested, stunning the outside world. Wim Hof (born 1959) is able to perform exceptionally, almost unnatural, on what he is focused on. Due to our lifestyle today we are far removed from our natural bodily condition. We breathe much more shallow which means that our body is not optimally supplied with oxygen.. According to Wim, it’s not complicated at all: ""What I am capable of, everybody can learn"".He accomplished 21 Guinness World Records with the most exceptional and unique performances.Scientists around the world baffled by this exceptional performance. In the Netherlands, Prof. Maria Hopman of the UMC St Radboud Nijmegen examined Wim’s physiology as he was affected by the cold, while he was up to his neck in a cylinder filled with ice cubes.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

And in running away from ourselves in love, do we ultimately avoid the work needed to return to selfhood that will actually bring us happiness.Hayley Quinn is the UK’s leading Dating Expert and has helped 100,000’s of men and women re-think their love lives.A graduate in English and Psychoanalysis from UCL Hayley set up her own company as a reaction to encountering the ‘pick up artist’ culture and working as a ghost writer for characters from the New York Times bestseller ‘The Game’.An advocate of real life dating skills she’s used her websites (http://www.hayleyquinn.com[hayleyquinn.com]), and her online member’s clubs to show people that there’s more to life than meeting someone than Tinder.She’s been a featured expert for numerous international TV shows and has had a Channel 4 Cutting Edge documentary ‘BiCurious Me’ based around her explorations into sexuality and relationships. She has also written for Cosmopolitan, the Independent, the Telegraph and regular provides social experiment vlogs to news sites.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Why The US Has No High-Speed Rail,News & Politics,7914947,"76,191","6,887","China has the world’s fastest and largest high-speed rail network — more than 19,000 miles, the vast majority of which was built in the past decade.Japan’s bullet trains can reach nearly 200 miles per hour and date to the 1960s. They have moved more than 9 billion people without a single passenger causality. casualty France began service of the high-speed TGV train in 1981 and the rest of Europe quickly followed.But the U.S. has no true high-speed trains, aside from sections of Amtrak’s Acela line in the Northeast Corridor. The Acela can reach 150 mph for only 34 miles of its 457-mile span. Its average speed between New York and Boston is about 65 mph.California’s high-speed rail system is under construction, but whether it will ever get completed as intended is uncertain.Watch the video to see why the U.S. continues to fail with high-speed trains, and some companies that are trying to fix that.» Subscribe to CNBC: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

What does the Quran really say about a Muslim woman's hijab? | Samina Ali | TEDxUniversityofNevada,Nonprofits & Activism,6324135,"188,083","33,385","In recent times, the resurgence of the hijab along with various countries’ enforcement of it has led many to believe that Muslim women are required by their faith to wear the hijab. In this informative talk, novelist Samina Ali takes us on a journey back to Prophet Muhammad's time to reveal what the term “hijab” really means -- and it's not the Muslim woman's veil! So what does “hijab” actually mean, if not the veil, and how have fundamentalists conflated the term to deny women their rights? This surprising and unprecedented idea will not only challenge your assumptions about hijab but will change the way you see Muslim women.Samina Ali is an award-winning author, activist and cultural commentator. Her debut novel, Madras on Rainy Days, won France’s prestigious Prix Premier Roman Etranger Award and was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award in Fiction. Ali’s work is driven by her belief in personal narrative as a force for achieving women’s individual and political freedom and in harnessing the power of media for social transformation. She is the curator of the groundbreaking, critically acclaimed virtual exhibition, Muslima: Muslim Women’s Art & Voices.

For example; going to the gym for 1 hour doesn't seem that hard, because the initial motivation is a powerful driving force.But when we're motivated it's also easy to impose some super high expectations on ourselves.We think: ""Ok, so I went to the gym for 1 hour the first few days. From now on I'll to go to the gym for 1 full hour every single day.""But once that initial motivation fades away after a few days, there is now nothing that's driving us forward, and we haven't really formed a habit yet.That's why when we're unmotivated, we'll probably just skip gym altogether, as dedicating a whole hour to it seems daunting.So instead of relying on motivation to push us forward, we should focus on making our new habit, an actual habit.Let me explain what I mean, by introducing you to the 2 minute rule.",PT9M4S,2019-01-21,2019-01-21,112325,Better Than Yesterday,/channel/UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,19,-3QJke9_Z4o

Bb6Two weeks after Fischer's sensational 6-0 shutout streak in the Fischer - Taimanov Candidates Quarterfinal (1971), at Vancouver, he met at Temple Buell College, Denver, Colorado USA to play a 10-game candidates match against Bent Larsen starting on July 6, 1971. Larsen had qualified from the Larsen - Uhlmann Candidates Quarterfinal (1971). Fischer said to a reporter before the match: ""Been traveling for a year, match to match. I need a personal life. I'm not as narrow as some people think, you know. But right now all I think of is the world championship. Chess is my whole life"" ... ""(Larsen)'s good. But I think I'm the best around. I don't say that to brag. I think it's true. I love the game - and I hate the Russians because they've almost ruined it. They only risk the title when they have to, every three years. They play for draws with each other but play to win against the Western masters. Draws make for dull chess, wins make for fighting chess."" (1)And fighting chess is what Fischer delivered. After six consecutive wins he dispensed with Denmark's best, repeating another amazing 6-0 performance. Preparing to face Boris Spassky in a World Championship match, he would first meet the winner of the Petrosian - Korchnoi Candidates Semifinal (1971). This turned out to be Petrosian, hence the Fischer - Petrosian Candidates Final (1971). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.Link to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmatorBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7Nano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoqCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.ac...Check out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5...Steemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...Twitter: https://twitter.com/agadmatorInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/Lichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmatorChess.com: agadmatorLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)Blizzard: agadmator #2992 Check out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKe...Check out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0...Send your photos and videos here:subscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com#agadmator #bobbyfischer #bobbyfischerstory",PT26M35S,2018-08-22,2018-08-22,221441,agadmator's Chess Channel,/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,18,peyW-jGXIOI

How to make diseases disappear | Rangan Chatterjee | TEDxLiverpool,Nonprofits & Activism,2627590,"45,319","2,156","Can you actually make a disease disappear? Dr Rangan Chatterjee thinks you can. Often referred to as the doctor of the future, Rangan is changing the way that we look at illness and how medicine will be practised in years to come. He highlighted his methods in the groundbreaking BBC TV show, Doctor In The House, gaining him much acclaim from patients, his contemporaries and the media.He is the author of the international bestseller, The 4 Pillar Plan - http://amzn.to/2yGfpuB which has been released in the USA and Canada under the title, How to Make Disease Disappear - https://amzn.to/2GstJf6 Rangan’s 15 years of clinical experience in the NHS includes internal medicine, immunology and general practice. A pioneer in the emerging field of progressive medicine, he also uses techniques from other disciplines he has studied including movement kinetics and functional medicine.His own journey of learning was accelerated when family members fell ill and now Rangan is helping people to take control of their health by addressing the root causes of their illnesses, something which is often not achieved in 21st century health care, evidenced by a steady increase in the rates of chronic disease.Rangan is a super-generalist, looking at as many factors as possible which can create wellness or illness. His talk is testament to how our thinking around the concept of disease needs to change to help form a map for future healthcare.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Imagination: It’s Not What You Think. It’s How You Think | Charles Faulkner | TEDxIIT,Nonprofits & Activism,721162,"8,779",399,"Imagination is not what you think. It’s how you think. Cognitive research reveals that images, metaphors and stories are the basis of our mental operating system: the origin of our intuitions and our irrationality. Counterintuitively, more accurate insights do not come from increasing information or reason, but educating our imagination.Charles Faulkner is an independent researcher on language and its effects on communication, decision-making and change. He has worked in the Silicon Valley, ‘the City’ of London and 3M, HP, IBM, HSBC and Cargill. His decision-making work is featured in books including The New Market Wizards. His popular works include the audio programs: The New Technology of Achievement, Success Mastery, and Creating Irresistible Influence. His original work on metaphoric communication and change is documented in three programs. He has lectured in 15 countries including at the University of Chicago, Columbia College NYC, the Sorbonne, and London School of Economics.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Why We Struggle Learning Languages | Gabriel Wyner | TEDxNewBedford,Nonprofits & Activism,1211901,"43,197",699,"The only barrier to learning a language is memory. - The process of language learning is the process of forming memories. Nothing more, nothing less. If you understand that, and you understand how memories are formed, then you can make progress in a way you've never dreamed possible before. Gabriel Wyner is an author, opera singer and polyglot based in Chicago. After reaching fluency in German in 14 weeks with the help of the immersive Middlebury Language Schools, he fell in love with the process of language learning, going on to spend two months in intensive Italian courses in Perugia, Italy. Searching for ways to bring the immersion experience into the home, he began to develop a system that rapidly builds fluency in short, daily sessions. In 2010, his efforts paid off. He learned French to fluency in 5 months, and then Russian in 10 months. Born in Los Angeles, he graduated summa cum laude in 2007 from the University of Southern California with dual degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Vocal Arts Performance, and was awarded the Renaissance Scholar’s prize for excellence in unrelated disciplines. He then moved to Vienna to pursue triple Master’s degrees at the Konservatorium Wien in Opera, Lieder and Voice, and graduated with honors in 2011. Currently learning Japanese, he's learned Hungarian and Spanish over the last few years. His book on language learning – Fluent Forever: How to learn any language fast and never forget it – was published on August 5, 2014 (Harmony/Random House). His most recent project has been the development of a new language learning tool, which became the most successful Kickstarter for an app in history in September of 2017. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The credit crunch has shown how the global financial system has become increasingly dependent on mathematical models trying to quantify human (economic) behaviour.

Will we be able to keep control of this model-based financial system, or have we created a monster?

Do we live in a multiverse? | The Economist,Science & Technology,2487115,"16,193",628,"It has long been thought that our universe is all there is, but it is possible we may live in just one of many. This is the second in our six-part series on unsolved mysteries in science. Read the accompanying article: http://www.economist.com/news/science....Subscribe NOW to The Economist: http://econ.st/1Fsu2VjWhen the ancients looked into the night sky they thought the heavens revolved around the earth and mankind. over the centuries this view has changed radically.We discovered we lived on a planet orbiting a star within the solar system and the solar system was found to be part of the Milky Way galaxy. Later we learned that our universe was filled with billions of other such galaxies - but could it be that we're committing the same error as our ancestors by thinking the universe contains everything there is? Could it be that we live in a multiverse?There are a number of different theories about what the multiverse could be. One proponent of the idea of the multiverse is Dr Tegmark of MIT. Dr Tegmark suggests a four fold  classification of possible types of multiverse. The first type of multiverse is just an extension of what we already know our universe expanding into infinity rather than ending at the limits of our vision.We can look back almost to the beginning of time to the edge of the observable universe, but we can see no further. So the space beyond that distance known as the Hubble radius is literally out of sight. But that doesn't mean there isn't anything there. Because the expansion of the universe has stretched space, astronomers are able to see out to a distance of about 42 billion light years. How far things extend beyond this is unknown. If they stretch to infinity there could be numerous isolated universes cut off from one another by their own Hubble radius - depending on the observers vantage point.To understand the second type of multiverse in Dr Tegmark system it is first necessary to understand how the universe was formed and the theory of inflation. It was first conceived of by Alan Guth in 1979 and then later refined and expanded upon by Andrei Linde who had some key insights. This is one of the ideas of string theory which attempts to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics. The thinking is that all of the solutions produced by string theory that don't match up with what we can see in our own universe, may actually represent reality in other universes. The anthropic principle is the idea that our universe is fine-tuned to allow humans to live. A small fiddle with  the strength of gravity for example and life as we know it would not exist - a coincidence that does not sit easily with scientists. The concept of a multiverse neatly addresses this problem within the infinite number of universes that could exist we are simply living in the one we are able to.In the third type Dr Tegmark multiverse in the first the laws of physics are the same from one to another. In this type though the component universes are separated not by distance but by time. At every moment within such a multiverse all of the possible futures allowed by the uncertainties of quantum mechanics actually happen.In the many worlds theory of the multiverse the entirety of the universe acts like the quantum photon, but instead of having two potential future states, every possible outcome would be manifested so our entire universe and everything within it, including you, would be constantly undergoing multiple visions into daughter universes - each with its own reality and future. Any given observer though would only see one outcome.In the final classification, the level 4 multiverse, Dr Tegmark proposes that all coherent mathematical systems describe a physical reality of some sort. Those different systems are of necessity different universes. What this last idea translates to in practice is hard to conceive of - it is more the province of metaphysics than physics, but the other three types of multiverse though they push the bounds of physical theory do not overstep them. Observational data supporting the theory of inflation have convinced some scientists that a multiverse is possible - but the idea is still controversial.It may be impossible to ever directly observe the multiverse but some scientists hope to eventually gather enough data supporting the theories that predict it to one day confirm its existence. If that were to happen, like the ancients before us, we would be given a whole new perspective on how the cosmos works and on our place in it.Get more The EconomistFollow us:  https://twitter.com/TheEconomistLike us: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomistView photos:  https://instagram.com/theeconomist/The Economist videos give authoritative insight and opinion on international news, politics, business, finance, science, technology and the connections between them.",PT8M58S,2015-08-14,2015-08-14,155323,The Economist,/channel/UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,20,Rx7erWZ8TjA
Eric Whitacre's Deep Field - A Tribute in Images,Music,60868,633,16,"In 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope captured one of the most influential and humbling images in history – the Hubble Deep Field. The image covers a speck of the sky only about the width of a dime seen from 75 feet away. The exposure lasted 10 consecutive days, or approximately 150 orbits.Though the field is a very small sample of the heavens, it is considered representative of the typical distribution of galaxies in space, because the universe, statistically, looks largely the same in all directions. Gazing into this small field, Hubble uncovered a bewildering assortment of at least 1,500 galaxies at various stages of evolution.Deep Field was premiered with the Minnesota Orchestra & Minnesota Chorale on 8 May 2015 in Orchestra Hall, Minneapolis, conducted by Eric. The second performance & European premiere took place at the BBC Proms on 9 August at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, BBC Singers & BBC Chorus, once again conducted by Eric.To create a sound worthy of the Deep Field images, Eric had the idea to take advantage of the speakers in the room – the phones of his fans. For a composition this ambitious in scope, Eric felt that he’d need to include everyone in the audience. So instead of reminding his audience to turn off their phone for the performance, he directs them to pump up the volume and play along.You can Download the App Here:Apple: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/deep-...Android:https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...Wait until minute 18:30 to play the concert experience in the app!NOTE: I don't own any rights for the music or the images.

You think about your next move and end up looking again and again at the same variations trying to make sure you aren’t making a mistake? If you say yes, then watch the video below to see how VISUALWIZE will improve your visualization skill!Why is it so important to improve your visualization skill?Well, here's the thing: If you feel that you are still making too many blunders in your games, or if you find that you are often calculating the same move over and over again - just to be sure you didn’t miss something - then that is definitely a sign that you need to improve your visualization skill.In fact, visualization skill is one of the most important skills a chess player should possess because, since you are not allowed to move the pieces on the board when you are thinking, you have to able to visualize those moves in your mind. And you need to be confident in your ability to do so, because if you aren’t -- you will constantly doubt yourself - and it is this doubt that could cause you to make a mistake that loses the game right away.So to help you gain confidence in your ability to visualize the moves in your mind, you can absolutely rely on the training method I use in the VISUALWIZE program because the training method is designed to specifically improve your visualization skill. And the reason why it works so well is that the exercises simulate the actual visualization process that you would use in a real game.The best way to experience how this training method works is to look at the example that I demonstrated in the video at the top of this page.More benefits to be gained when you train with VISUALWIZEYou will be able see moves in your mind before making them on the board.An improved visualisation skill will help you to avoid blunders and mistakes causing you to instantly lose the game.Using Visualwize will additionally benefit your training in other aspects of your chess as you improve your ability to visualize notation below chess diagrams.Save time on the clock – you won’t need to calculate variations over and over because you will have more confidence in your ability to foresee the consequences of your candidate moves.Increase your overall tactical awareness since the exercises require you to visualize tactics in an imaginary position.",PT5M25S,2017-05-05,2017-05-05,225251,Louis Holtzhausen,/channel/UChAvByoQL3uq9XzzVw0yvEw,UChAvByoQL3uq9XzzVw0yvEw,20,M3F30Hz0mZU

"COVID-19 in China, South-Korea, Taiwan and Japan | DW Documentary",Education,651346,"3,864",666,"China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan appear to have coronavirus pretty well under control. Much of that is down to early response, close monitoring and extensive use of modern science and technology. And not to be overlooked: the citizens willingness to adhere to government-imposed regulations.Reporters in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan look into how these countries have weathered the crisis and largely contain the coronavirus. In South Korea, rigorous testing and state-of-the-art technology have been key in keeping the number of infections and deaths low. In Taiwan, access to masks and a sense of solidarity help to hold the virus at bay. In Japan, discipline and strict hygiene measures have allowed public life to continue without too much interruption, even in densely populated Tokyo. And in China, where the coronavirus pandemic started, quarantines, lock-down and strict surveillance have contributed to slowing spread. Whether or not these methods prove sustainable in the long run remains to be seen. But they are sending a message of hope that there may be ways out of the coronavirus crisis.-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Astronomer Stephen Webb has an explanation: we're alone in the universe. In a mind-expanding talk, he spells out the remarkable barriers a planet would need to clear in order to host an extraterrestrial civilization -- and makes a case for the beauty of our potential cosmic loneliness.

Invisible to Engines | One Of The Greatest Moves Ever Played,Entertainment,1160061,"21,132",483,"#agadmator Link to the photo http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess....In 2002, the annual Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting had an added significance: it also functioned as a Candidates Tournament, for the winner would earn the right to play Vladimir Kramnik for the title. Seven of the top ten players competed in Germany, and emerging as winner was the Hungarian chess prodigy, Peter Leko.The financial backing for the match (a prize fund of $1.2 million) was contributed by the the cigar manufacturer Dannemann, the latest in a line of corporate sponsors (Intel, Braingames, and Einstein) for the non-FIDE World Championship title. The match was only 14 games, one of the shortest in World Chess Championship history. Kramnik was to retain the title in the event of a tie match, a detail which was to prove very important.The very first game illustrated Kramnik's incredible defensive techniques. Leko, by most accounts, had the advantage by move 23; but Kramnik's masterful handling of the ending, combined with an error by Leko, enabled the Russian to take the full point. Not until the fifth game was Leko able to accomplish what Garry Kasparov could not: beat Kramnik in a World Championship match. Then in the eighth game, Leko was able to take the lead, when he achieved victory with the Black pieces by alertly finding over the board a serious flaw in Kramnik's immense opening preparation. Games 9 through 13 were all draws, leaving Leko ahead in the match with only one game left.Come game 14, Leko needed only one more draw to secure the title of World Chess Champion.

In the end, Carlsen arrived at an endgame position where he had 4 pawns for a bishop with both players having a rook. And as we all know, Carlsen is a brilliant endgame player and he won the game easily. Watch the instructive video analysis of this game now presented by GM Igor Smirnov! ♕ How to succeed in chess?

Being offline is the new luxury - VPRO documentary,News & Politics,69257,"1,189",44,"When have you been offline for the last time? Did you choose yourself to be offline or was internet not working? To be offline seems more and more to become a choice that we see as a luxury. Is being offline the new luxury or is it still a luxury to be online for some people?Digital networks are becoming denser and denser. We are online all the time everywhere and they are fewer places where we really can be alone. Where and when can we still disconnect? To be offline has become a luxury. Will we permanently use data or do we take back control over our connectivity? In this documentary we go on a journey to the edge of internet. To be online all the time and everywhere. It sounds great, but it has its drawbacks. As digital networks are closing in, there are fewer places to be really on your own. Being offline is becoming a luxury. Where can you be offline? We are connected to the internet even in our bedrooms. It’s the ambition of companies like Google and Facebook to connect the entire world, so that we can be online all the time and everywhere. Google has sent balloons up into the skies over Sri Lanka to provide the island state with free Wi-Fi for a month. On the ground, more and more devices communicate through the so-called Internet-of-Things. We are going to be ‘glass citizens’ in a transparent house, connected for life to a wireless intravenous drip and traced anywhere via our smartphones. What does it mean? A small but growing group of people is saying goodbye to lifetime connectability. They are researching ways to keep control. What can we learn from them about life in the digital era?

Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4663777,"49,794","3,399","Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In a 1920 tournament in Berlin he finished first (+6−2=1) ahead of Efim Bogoljubov, Savielly Tartakower, Richard Réti, Géza Maróczy, and Siegbert Tarrasch. Breyer had a plus record against Max Euwe (later world champion).In 1921 Breyer set a new blindfold chess record by playing 25 games simultaneously. He also edited Szellemi Sport, a magazine devoted to chess puzzles, and composed at least one brilliant retrograde analysis study.Heart disease cut short Breyer's promising chess career. He died in 1921 at the age of 28 in Bratislava. He was buried in Bratislava and after exhumation in 1987, was reburied in the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest.Read more here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyula_B...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin, Litecoin or Nano.Link to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmatorBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7Nano address xrb_383y7ofu5wsyfr9o8rh93aqaq8aixpdcbaud5iubydukz5moiadsirmuzgoqCheck out some of the books I enjoy https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.ac...Check out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYgd5...Steemit: https://steemit.com/@agadmator/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...Twitter: https://twitter.com/agadmatorInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/Lichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmatorChess.com: agadmatorLeague of Legends: agadmator (EUNE, my friend is using my EUWE account for a couple of years now)Blizzard: agadmator #2992 Check out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKe...Check out the SUBSCRIBERS VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xa0...Send your photos and videos here:subscribers.videos.agadmator@gmail.com",PT21M19S,2018-09-14,2018-09-14,223324,agadmator's Chess Channel,/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,19,FzuOFf9M7II

"Why I, as a black man, attend KKK rallies. | Daryl Davis | TEDxNaperville",Nonprofits & Activism,6148244,"277,828","4,658","A chance encounter with members of the Ku Klux Klan led black musician Daryl Davis on a quest to determine the source of the hate. His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.Daryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley’s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a “certificate of friendship” from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He’s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly’s granddaughter.Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations.

These people tweeted almost like it was a challenge to get fired !Twitter can be a great place to share ideas. The microblogging platform has a large worldwide audience. It is estimated that every day 100 million people are daily active users on Twitter and that Twitter has 261 million international users.  However, as with any other social media, you have to be careful about what you say and post on Twitter. A growing problem is people losing their jobs over inappropriate tweets. Employers attempt to address this problem by establishing rules for employees to follow. According to lawyer Bryan Wood, “many major employers have social media policies that address activity on both personal and professional accounts.” They include advice about “basic decency” and what would seem to be common sense measures such as “be respectful” and “protect proprietary company information.” What can happen if you don’t follow these policies?

How to Master 🤔 the Greek Gift Sacrifice (Bxh7+) with Susan Polgar,People & Blogs,71009,881,28,"♕ FULL COURSE: https://www.ichess.net/shop/polgar-ch...♕ 10 GM SECRETS: https://www.ichess.net/10gmsecrets/♕ MORE: https://www.ichess.net/2016/09/13/mas...The Greek Gift sacrifice – a Bishop sac on h7 or h2, usually with check – is perhaps the most famous in chess. The idea is simple: open the h-file and bring the King forward; jump a Knight into g5/g4 with check, follow up with the Queen and force checkmate.In reality, there’s a lot more to it. Sometimes the King can refuse the Greek Gift sacrifice. Other times it can be accepted as the King can escape to f8 then e7. In some situations, the King can even come forward to g6 and be safe.The temptation to play the Greek Gift sacrifice must, therefore, be balanced with careful analysis. Indeed, the subtleties of this combination are such that an entire book has been devoted to the subject. That’s surely overkill, however. There are a few rules and patterns which, when learned, will help you decide whether the Greek Gift sacrifice works. And GM Susan Polgar explains them in this video, a free preview of her Secrets of Chess Tactics (Advanced) course.The first thing to consider is whether our opponent can decline the Greek Gift sacrifice by playing …Kh8. If we already had another piece under attack, we’d now have 2 pieces en prise. Then, if we saved the other piece, Black wouldn’t have to capture on h7 with his King. Instead, he could play …g6, trapping the piece and preventing Qh5. So that’s something to watch out for. If there are no other pieces en prise, we can simply retreat the Bishop and we’ve won a pawn and still have some dangerous threats on the h-file.In most cases, Black accepts the Greek Gift sacrifice and we follow up with Nf3-g5+. It’s important to make sure the Knight is supported on this square; our dark-squared Bishop usually does this job. This Knight move also opens the diagonal for Qe1-h5 on the next move. There are lots of different patterns depending on where the Black King moves to when checked by the Knight, Kg8 is most common.Now White plays Qh5 and, if there’s still a Rook on f8, mate is threatened. When Black moves the Rook we can still mate in 2 if e7 is blocked (often by a Bishop) with Qh7+ and Qh8#. If e7 is free then 4.Qxf7+ Kh8 5.Qh5+ Kg8 6.Qh7+ Ke7 7.Qxg7+ usually mates pretty quickly.GM Susan Polgar goes on to demonstrate the tactical patterns and winning methods for other variations of the Greek Gift sacrifice, including a brave King advance to g6 or h6. You’ll also learn how to checkmate or win material when key squares are defended, making this a very useful lesson whether you find yourself playing or defending the Greek Gift sacrifice.Enjoy this video and check out the complete Secrets of Chess Tactics (Advanced) course.",PT30M6S,2016-09-13,2016-09-13,22241,iChess Channel 2,/channel/UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,19,psUv-bgYB88

"I Tried Rich People's Habits, See How My Life Changed",Howto & Style,6239877,"160,053","3,718","How to make more money? They say that the morning is the most important part of the day. And rich people always get the most out of the early hours. Well, actually, that's why they're rich. Chaotic morning always messes up the rest of the day, and you can't be productive. So if your plan is to become rich, the millionaire morning routine is exactly what you need.Other videos you might like:A Simple Trick on How to Save Up A Lot of Money Fast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Z0Q...14 Facts About Money You Should Know by Age 30 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLbBF...11 Tips from Millionaires on How to Save Up a Lot of Money https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj_oS...TIMESTAMPS:Things you should do every morning 1:09MY EXPERIMENT Becoming an early bird 2:30Trying to meditate without falling asleep 3:00Quick workout and a cold shower. Grrr! 3:37My favorite part of my new morning routine 4:04Spend weekends to your advantage 4:37One of the best ways to achieve the inner balance 5:15The rules I created 6:28Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY:- Tim Cook, Richard Branson, and tons of other successful people are early birds, right? So from that moment on, my alarm was set for 5:30 in the morning.- Next up was meditation. Doing this practice in the morning allows you to connect with yourself and kick-start your day with positive energy.- After that, it's good to do an easy 2- to 3-minute workout. - Practicing meditation also didn't go so smoothly at the beginning. After trying numerous apps and techniques, I found that simple breathing works best for me.- Having a quick workout wasn't a problem for me. Moreover, it really helped me get in touch with my body and shake off some of the tiredness before showering. - Making to-do lists for the day turned out to be exceptionally fulfilling and motivating. By day 10, I’d begun to make 2 lists a day: one for my personal goals and another for work tasks and responsibilities.- About halfway through my experiment, I got into time management, which turned out to be another amazing discovery for me!- When I found ways to upgrade my career, I turned to my personal life and added one more habit to my routine: writing morning pages. This endless stream of consciousness opened my eyes to numerous personal problems I never realized I had.- Make it a habit to write down all the things you're grateful for every evening.- Stay hydrated. Toward the end of my experiment, I read that having a glass of water before breakfast helps to wake up your digestive system and set it up nicely for the day. - Make yourself a smoothie. Natural smoothies are full of the nutrients and vitamins that your body needs as it wakes up.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCPhotos: https://www.depositphotos.comEast News----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",PT8M25S,2019-03-04,2019-03-04,11231,BRIGHT SIDE,/channel/UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,19,5EnvxbCkiNI

Archeology - exploring the past with modern technology | DW History Documentary,Education,1234754,"5,332",416,"Today modern archaeology often works with digital technology. Geophysics has allowed thousands of ancient sites to be located - a huge gain for science.The dig is no longer the be-all and end-all of archeology. We accompany some archeologists on their journey into the virtual past. Geophysics comprises a range of techniques with various geological and military functions. Geomagnetism is used to locate enemy submarines or potential reserves of oil or other minerals. Now, German and Irish archeologists have teamed up to use it to trace prehistoric grave systems. Researchers in western Germany are applying it to locate ancient procession and pilgrimage routes. Shipping archeologists in Bremerhaven are availing of digital technology to create virtual models of shipwrecks and, in Berlin, archeologists and game designers have also embarked on a joint project. As luck would have it, they scanned every millimeter of a temple in the Syrian city of Aleppo, not suspecting that, soon afterwards, the complex would be largely destroyed in the country’s civil war. Their virtual model is evidence that the study of the past can have uses for the present, just as technologies of the present can help us to study the past._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Yes, one can certainly go to this place and acquire a handful of illegal substances, and yes, if a person so chooses they can scour the dark web and find images that most of the world would find repellent, but let’s just say you won’t find hitmen for hire all over the dark web nor as much video violence than we might have thought.

When Royal Inbreeding Went Horribly Wrong,Education,5540433,"83,933","3,281","What are the cases when the royals family inbred? What are the consequences of royal inbreeding? Today we are going to look at the stories of the past, when royal inbreeding went horribly wrong. When we talk about inbreeding we are referring to reproducing with someone who is closely related in terms of genetics. We see this happen a lot when dogs are bred, and many people are critical of it. You see, when a pooches’ mum and dad are not genetically related that puppy gets diverse genes. This is a good thing as if both were the same or similar and carried a faulty gene the puppy would also get that fault. With a mix, it has more choice and can override the bad gene. As one dog breeding website puts it, some inbred dogs are “born sick and die sick.” With that in mind, how does inbreeding bode for humans? That’s what we’ll find out today, in this episode of the Infographics Show, When Royal inbreeding went wrong.SUBSCRIBE TO US -► http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITE (SUGGEST A TOPIC):http://theinfographicsshow.com SUPPORT US: Patreon.......► https://www.patreon.com/theinfographi...

The Art 🎨 of ATTACK🗡: Everything You Need to Learn From BOBBY FISCHER! - GM SUSAN POLGAR,People & Blogs,32068,415,9,"♕ FULL COURSE: https://www.ichess.net/shop/polgar-ch...♕ 10 GM SECRETS: https://www.ichess.net/10gmsecrets/♕ MORE: https://www.ichess.net/2016/08/09/cri...http://www.facebook.com/iChessNET/ | http://twitter.com/onlinechesslessIn this video, GM Susan Polgar reveals what we can learn by examining the critical moments from Bobby Fischer’s games. Bobby had great intuition for these moments, which is one of the reasons he was able to achieve such win so many games – he rarely missed an opportunity.For many moves in a chess game, we have a few reasonable choices. We can pick any of them without winning or losing the game there and then. However, there are certain times where we get a golden chance to win or save the game; if we miss the move, our chance is gone.While recognizing these opportunities is a matter of practice, there are a number of signs that such a move might exist. One of these is tension in the position. If one side’s forces are all busy defending other pieces or squares, there might be a way to increase the pressure a little bit more and crack the defense.We see a great example in the first of Bobby Fischer’s games in this video (part of Susan Polgar’s The Art of Attack – Intermediate). Bobby, playing Black, has a pawn on the 7th rank, blocked by a White Rook. Spending a few moves to double Rooks on the 7th rank seems sensible but White has a passed pawn too. Doubling Rooks would allow White’s a-pawn to promote, meaning the best Black could achieve would be a draw by perpetual check. Instead, sensing the pressure, Bobby finds a devastating move, deciding the game immediately.The next position is also delicately balanced. Bobby has White and 2 of his pieces are under attack but he has a nice pin on his opponent’s Queen. Fischer’s move, however, ignores both the attacks and the pin, taking advantage of another feature in the position. At the end of the combination, it looks like Black is level on material but Fischer has seen further ahead and emerges a pawn up after his next move. An important point is that Bobby has not only won a pawn, he’s also achieved a superior position. This will have been taken into account before starting the tactic.Susan Polgar goes on to show many more examples from Bobby Fischer’s games, including a timely trade into a winning endgame and ways to capitalize on a space advantage.Enjoy the video and remember to check out the complete course here.",PT25M26S,2016-08-09,2016-08-09,222415,iChess Channel 2,/channel/UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,19,6DTbhDZucYU

ЛЕГЕНДАРНАЯ ПАРТИЯ Ботвинник - Фишер!,Gaming,145438,"3,065",115,"Легендарная партия Ботвинник – Фишер (Варна, 1962) оказалась единственной встречей за шахматной доской между шестым и одиннадцатым чемпионами мира! Неожиданным маневром на выходе из дебюта Роберт Фишер поставил под сомнение результаты дебютного анализа в исполнении Чемпиона Мира. Потеряв пешку, Михаил Ботвинник перевёл партию в трудное для себя окончание. Но небрежность Фишера в реализации преимущества привела к ладейному эндшпилю, в котором у Михаила Ботвинника появились реальные шансы на спасение. Последующий анализ отложенной позиции в исполнении советской олимпийской сборной позволил обнаружить скрытую идею контригры, позволившую Ботвиннику при доигрывании спасти партию. Этот напряжённый поединок вызвал большой интерес у любителей и профессионалов шахмат во всём мире и стал настоящим украшением Всемирной шахматной олимпиады 1962 года!++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Использованная литература:1.

Flight of the Future - Science Fiction or Reality,Science & Technology,4166924,"17,534","2,346","Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...In the not too distant future strange craft will zoom across our skies.  These are not UFOs, they’re not alien craft from another planet, these are machines developed and built by human engineers and designers.  Today’s science fiction will become tomorrow’s reality.  These are the aircraft of the future!What you’re about to see is a glimpse into the future of aviation.  Winged aircraft as we know them will soon be a thing of the past.  Across the world designers are racing to create fantastic new aircraft that can fly humans higher, faster, and further than ever before.  New military designs, airliners that can take us to the edge of space and around the planet in minutes, and new propulsion systems that will make the jet engine obsolete forever.One casualty of this race for the future sits abandoned on an airfield, this fighter was more advanced than aircraft in service, but was already obsolete.  It was the loser in the engineering competition of the century.  In 1985 the United States Air Force demanded a new fighter plane, one that would incorporate the most up-to-date advances in stealth and agility.  Two multibillion dollar designs by rival companies took to the air in a fight to the death.  One was the Northrop YF-23, it had diamond shaped wings.  The other was the Lockheed YF-22.  The winner would become the backbone of the US Air Force, the loser a billion dollar pile of scrap.A fierce fight was about to take place between the two most advanced fighter aircraft ever built.  The test pilots fought to outperform each other.  But after the YF-23’s wheels touched the ground it never flew again.  With its greater performance and agility, the YF-22 was chosen to take the US Air Force into the next millennium.  It is a truly remarkable craft, it is able to reach speeds and perform manoeuvres far beyond that of the front line fighter of the time, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.",PT52M3S,2014-12-24,2014-12-24,142121,Naked Science,/channel/UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,20,qn2x62G5GmM

I Kissed My BF And Woke Up..,Film & Animation,1165649,"23,576","1,482","down the stairs, barking from the inside. They must’ve figured that it was an emergency and they kicked down the door. My dog led them to my room where they found me. The moment I saw the paramedic, I passed out. I only woke up in a hospital bed. I had no idea what time it was or where I was. “Hello, sleepy head!” said a voice. I couldn’t see clearly, I felt really dizzy and confused. “Where am I?” A sharp pain shot through my stomach. My face pulled as if I was eating a lemon. It was complete agony. “Shhh, Rest, sweetheart!” the voice said. I couldn’t really see what was going on, but I could feel a needle stuck in my arm. This stranger was touching my arm where the needle was, then it felt like she was injecting a fluid through the needle into my body. My eyes rolled, and I passed out again. It was morning when I woke up from the sun shining on my face. My mind was more clear. I was laying alone in a hospital room. As I gazed around the room I was shocked to see a horrendous sight. My stomach! It was swollen like I had swallowed a huge pumpkin. Did I die and woke up as a pregnant lady? I lifted up the sheets, and saw that my stomach was the size of a hot air balloon. Tears started rolling down my face, I cried so loud that a nurse came running through the door. She was saying something, but I couldn’t hear. I was looking at my dad wearing a full on nurse outfit. He was pointing his fist at some guy. How the heck did my perfect dad end up doing all these bad stuff? Shockingly, the worst was yet to come. I yelled DAD. He looked up and I was surprised to see something I didn’t expect. Hi, I’m Cheryl. Let me start from the beginning to give you a bit of a background story. This morning I woke up with a terrible stomach ache. I was in so much pain. It felt like a ball of thorns was stuck in my digestive system. It was so painful, that I couldn’t even get up or make a sound. I rolled over and fell out of bed onto my dog, who usually slept on the floor. He started whining. I couldn’t even rub his belly, to make him feel better. As I was laying on the floor, holding my stomach. My dog started barking. I knew no one was in the house to help me, I was alone. You see, my mom disappeared when I was a young girl. Leaving my dad to raise me as a single parent. My dad is a truck driver and he usually leaves the house at 5:30am for his job. Since I only get up a few hours later, he doesn’t ever wake me up. Leaving me to get some beauty sleep. I was crouching on the floor while my dog was barking at me. I sometimes wonder if my dog is a little bit stupid, can’t he see that I’m suffering? I felt numb, it was so painful. I couldn’t even get up to grab my cellphone. At that moment I felt like passing out, maybe just closing my eyes and saying ‘hi’ to the angels. I mean what would you do? In a situation like that?To my surprise, just as my stomach felt like it was going to rip out of my body. My dog stood on his hind legs, and used his nose to push my cellphone off of my bedside table. He pushed it towards my hand. Wow, he wasn’t so stupid after all. I could gather enough strength to call 911. The operator was really helpful. She dispatched an ambulance and within a few minutes paramedics were at my home. I could hear them knocking on the door.

We spoke with members of the Uighur community about their experience in these camps, and about China’s attempts to silence their history and lifestyle under the cover of darkness.Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-NewsCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.comFollow VICE News here:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenewsTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenewsTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/Instagram: http://instagram.com/vicenewsMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo#VICENewsTonight",PT31M48S,2019-06-29,2019-06-29,235541,VICE News,/channel/UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,20,v7AYyUqrMuQ

Visiting North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4461983,"21,705","2,398","Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed.

Just think about this for a moment; a single nuclear submarine today carries more firepower than was unleashed by all the armed forces of the Second World War. One big question is: could submarines of the future become stealthy and completely silent, like the fictional one from Tom Clancy’s Red October? You should be afraid if this ever becomes a reality because this submarine was built solely as a first-strike weapon… and what a devastating weapon it would be. They can also be used in a devastating retaliation against another nation’s missile bases and airfields. In fact, the USA keeps half of its nuclear arsenal on submarines either as a possible first-strike weapon or… or in retaliation as a deterrent to a nuclear strike.#submarine #submarines #boat #ship",PT10M6S,2020-01-29,2020-01-29,142454,Destiny,/channel/UCIFtADcWrOApqrsinzPoOfA,UCIFtADcWrOApqrsinzPoOfA,20,DieKOCLokO4

Cracking the Code of Cicada 3301| EPISODE 1,People & Blogs,3292886,"85,246","1,768","In 2012, a secretive group calling itself 3301 began recruiting for “highly intelligent individuals” online. Candidates had to prove their skills in codebreaking, cryptography and computer programming by solving a complex puzzle dubbed Cicada. It required knowledge of steganography, contacts on the ground everywhere from Seoul to Sydney, and the ability to obtain a copy of William Gibson’s famous disappearing poem “Agrippa.” What was the purpose of the puzzle? No one knows, but many set out to solve one of the internet’s greatest mysteries. At the age of 15, Marcus Wanner became one of the few to crack the code. But the Cicada challenge didn’t end there. Suddenly, more mysterious codes appeared—including a 58-page book of runes known as the “Liber Primus.”What was encrypted within the runes?

The Soviet Tu-16 That Flew too Close to a US Aircraft Carrier - Dark Footage,Education,1937541,"18,579","1,011","Subscribe to Dark5: http://bitly.com/dark5This secret US military footage shows a large, sleek military airplane flying low over an aircraft carrier. It then diverts and seemingly disappears into the sunny haze of the horizon...But then the same airplane returns. And this time flies even lower, appearing to slow down as it does so. It looks like its almost parallel to the deck of the carrier as it passes, that’s how low - and slow - it’s flying. A red star can be seen on the jet’s tail, revealing that it is a Russian plane. The video pauses at the 27-second mark – perhaps to denote the moment things went amiss.The plane banks up and briefly disappears back into the haze, this time in the opposite direction. It returns into view, now flying in the horizon perpendicular to the aircraft carrier. The video cuts to sailors and airmen now on the deck of the carrier, clearly engrossed in what’s going on out at sea.

How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement—and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017.

Star Size Comparison 2,Science & Technology,27469702,"356,336","11,040","Dear world,Let´s talk about time.When I uploaded my first YouTube video 7 years ago, I would have never thought that it would get that much attention. Had lots of discussions, met new people, continued to make videos about things that intrigued me. Or tried out effects.I enjoyed it a lot, and I still read every comment that pops up. And they keep coming in. It is a hobby that I am very glad about having started. And I am humbled by the attention. Well, as time went by I found less time to work on videos, struggled with other things in life, and wondered if I would ever find the time again.But I always knew one thing:I owe you something. All the time people were are asking about a sequel to starsize comparison. And yes, I promised once.I keep my promises. So, whenever I found time over the last year I spent it on that. Here it is.I hope you like it. I tried to do it in a bit different way. Curious for the feedback. I know I will be hardly able to beat the choice of music from the first part, but let me say, Vangelis Alpha is a piece that is very dear to my heart, I always had this in mind.Still looking for contact to musicians.I do not know what the future brings, but I hope we will hear from each other.

We've all found ourselves in conversation and felt attacked like we started off talking about one thing and then the other person twisted our words and before we knew it, we lost our cool, lost respect in their eyes, and maybe even acted like a jerk. Now, I don't normally do the same person twice in a row but this interview between Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson was just too interesting of an opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone who uses subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb. So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the most common tricks that people might be using on you and you're also gonna learn how to reverse those so that you can walk out of a kind of aggressive situation having earned more respect than you had going in. So first off, to stop a conversational bully, you have to realize what's going on before it's too late. Now, typically, a person will reveal their aggressive attitude early on with their tone of voice and their word choice. Check out the rest that we will show in this video and how Jordan Peterson tackles them.1:49 Jordan Peterson deals with so-you're-saying trap2:39 Jordan Peterson deals with the ""assuming the sale""5:30 Jordan Peterson deals with the smash technique7:08 But don't straw man the other person's ideas though7:47 And visual imagery can also help8:25 You can show them that they're already agreeing with youConnect With Us Further:Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandInstagram: @CharismaOnCommandOr if you want to see our personal stuff (regular life + playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertInstagram: @IamBenAltman",PT11M45S,2018-01-22,2018-01-22,235234,Charisma on Command,/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,20,nS9W-wlJHPA

Kickstarting a bicycle safety revolution: Kent Frankovich at TEDxSacramento TEDxCity2.0,Education,90533,687,49,"As an avid cyclist, Kent Frankovich wants more people to take to two wheels, but understands that lack of visibility is a safety concern for many would-be riders. His desire to increase nighttime bicycle rider safety and visibility, coupled with his electromechanical engineering background, inspired him to co-found Revolights, Inc. Originally invented as a way to improve on the industry standard for a headlight, visibility benefits of the patented Revolights bike lighting system quickly catapulted it to national attention through CNN, Mashable, the BBC, WIRED, the New York Times and numerous other media outlets.While at NASA-JPL, Frankovich provided electromechanical design support to Mars' Curiosity rover mission. He also worked to improve GI Tract Diagnostics as a researcher at the Stanford BioRobotics Laboratory. Kent now hopes to use his unique perspective to shed new light on the issue of bicycle safety, ensuring a better future for urbanites in the City2.0.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

His entire career, he never realised the importance of the mind until he partook in endurance races, in which the realisation struck, your mind has to takes over, and focus not on the past, not the future, but only the present, and naturally your body will follow. With this in mind, how can we apply it to our daily lives?Ned Phillips is the director of Alt Ex Advisory, a consultancy company which specializes in solutions to the changing landscape of financial technology across Asia.

The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",PT17M36S,2013-08-18,2013-08-18,133252,TEDx Talks,/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,19,mgBs_W5CFnw
Wanted: A Science of UFOs | Alexander Wendt | TEDxColumbus,Nonprofits & Activism,296413,"7,490",257,"NOTE FROM TED: We’ve flagged this talk, which was filmed at a TEDx event, because it appears to fall outside TEDx’s content guidelines. Claims made in this talk only represent the speaker’s personal understanding of UFOs which are not corroborated by scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...If any UFOs proved to be extra-terrestrial it would be one of themost important events in human history. Yet there has long been a taboo in modern society on taking UFOs seriously, which has blocked any systematic science to try to determine what they are. Skeptics will say that is because UFOs do not exist, but the US Navy has recently confirmed that they do, and is making an official policy change to reflect this fact, from ignoring its pilots’ UFO encounters to requiring them to file reports. Yet even with the Navy’s revelation,the UFO taboo remains so strong that the scientific community continues to show no interest in whether or not UFOs are ETs. In this talk Alexander Wendt argues that the UFO taboo is incoherent and unjustified, and proposes a crowd-funded science of UFOs as a way of beginning to learn more about these elusive phenomena. Alexander Wendt received his Ph.D. in political science from theUniversity of Minnesota in 1989. He subsequently taught at Yale, Dartmouth, and the University of Chicago before moving to The Ohio State University in 2004. His research interests center on international relations, where he is one of the most cited scholars in the field, and the philosophy of social science. He is the author of two books, Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge, 1999), which won the “Best Book of the Decade” award from the International Studies Association in 2006; and Quantum Mind and Social Science (Cambridge, 2015), which hasn’t won anything yet. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Charity: how effective is giving? | The Economist,News & Politics,147046,"3,041",175,"Today’s super-rich are putting record sums into tackling the world’s most pressing problems. But how altruistic is this golden age of charitable giving? Read more here: https://econ.st/3aHRmjcClick here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Today’s super-wealthy are richer than ever. And they’re giving away their billions like never before. Philanthropists are putting record sums into tackling the world’s most pressing problems. And unlike the mega-donors of the past today’s philanthropists want to see the results in their lifetimes. But how altruistic is this new golden age of giving? Have these mega-donors become too powerful?The way charities work is increasingly under the microscope. Donors large and small are demanding better bang for their buck. This is leading to innovative new approaches to doing good which are redefining notions of altruism.Hilton Douglas is an outreach worker for Urban Pathways, a non-profit benefiting from a recent explosion in charity amongst wealthy Americans. There are record numbers of homeless people in New York and every day Hilton tries to help some of the worst affected. In 2018 spending by charitable foundations  reached a record $75bn in America. The charity Hilton works for is one of 250 that are backed by New York’s largest and best-known foundation Robin Hood. Robin Hood provides a small percentage of Urban Pathways’ total income. But the foundation also donates strategic and operational assistance. Urban Pathways runs outreach programmes and a drop-in centre and provides a roof for around 850 men and women each night. Every year Robin Hood stages America’s biggest, glitziest fund-raising gala where it raises over 60% of its annual funding in three hours. While the average annual donation to the foundation is $108 the gala has helped Robin Hood become renowned as the charity of choice for hedge-fund managers and bankers. Over the past 30 years it’s raised and spent around $3bn fighting poverty in New York. Paul Tudor Jones founded Robin Hood. An investor and hedge-fund manager worth around $5bn, he believes private philanthropy leads the state in dealing with society’s problems. Journalist Anand Giridharadas spent three years exploring the motivations of America’s wealthy philanthropists. He has concluded that some of their business practices create the very social problems their philanthropy tries to address. Since 2011 former mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg has donated over $500m to campaigns to replace coal with clean energy in the US by 2030. But in taking on the battle against climate change Mr Bloomberg has also taken on other billionaire philanthropists on the opposing side of the debate. For decades oil barons Charles Koch and his late brother David have given billions of dollars to non-profit organisations in order to promote scepticism about global warming. The Kochs’ donations have had a huge impact on strengthening the climate-change denial lobby in America. But Michael Bloomberg’s donations to his campaign Beyond Coal have proved an influential counterbalance. So far these have helped retire 289 coal plants, more than half the countries total. America has witnessed the spectacle of its most-renowned philanthropists battling it out over one of the world’s most important political issues. It raises a fundamental question. How much political power should wealthy but unelected philanthropists wield? While powerful and wealthy philanthropists are increasingly giving away their money. Fewer people on average are giving in the developed world than two decades ago. It’s a decline that’s coincided with scandals that have rocked some of the world’s best-known charities. Little wonder charities are now experimenting with innovative new approaches to persuade donors to part with their cash. In the past ten years effective altruism has contributed over $100m in donations towards Against Malaria Foundation. The charity says this has helped fund the distribution of 50m bed nets worldwide, protecting 90m people and saving around 30,000 lives. But effective altruism, EA, has its critics who say giving is not a science and that there is more to charity than cold hard numbers. This scientific approach to charitable giving and work is on the rise and is assuming innovative new forms. It’s being used by some of today’s class of billionaire philanthropists. How this plays out alongside their rising power will help to redefine the impact of altruism. And how it’s perceived.

Anand Giridharadas on 'Winners Take All' and the charade of elite philanthropy  | VPRO Documentary,News & Politics,162609,"6,653",175,"Writer Anand Giridharadas describes in his book "" Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World "" why the rich do not pay taxes, but with their philanthropy determine the course of the world (and thereby undermine our democracy). ""Last year, more than four hundred billion dollars were spent on philanthropy in the United States. This is nearly going beyond the government budget - excluding the budget for defension. "" This is just one of the insights of the former New York Times columnist and writer Anand Giridharadas. He paints a picture of a parallel government: one that is not democratic, but that is run by the super-rich of this world.If rich people and companies avoid paying taxes as much as possible, but depicture the government as bureaucratic and then are taking credit when they open a new university building or hospital because their name is on it - what is left of our democracy?Giridharadas therefore advocates a return to the public interest through renewed cooperation within our democratic institutions. Because, that's how the writer rhetorically summarizes the problem:""Which rich person or company has done more for the elderly in the United States than social security?""""Which rich person or company has done more for health care for the poor than Medicaid?""""Which rich person or company has done more for women than the right to vote?""""Which rich person or company has done more for African Americans than the Votings Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act?""An interview with Anand Giridharadas about the super-rich and how they undermine democracy.

Is SpaceX's Raptor engine the king of rocket engines?,Science & Technology,2080129,"66,637","1,319","2:55 - Basic physics of rocket engines 6:10 - Rocket engine cycles 20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines44:05 - SummaryArticle version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823...SpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before! Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX’s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle’s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.And if that’s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they’re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we’ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.We'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.So by the end of this video hopefully we’ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it’s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines…-----------------------------------------------Rocket engine renders by  @MartianDays https://twitter.com/MartianDaysF-1 Turbopump photo provided by Mike Jetzer/heroicrelics.orgHUGE thanks to my Moon Walker Patreon supporters!

He’s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

WATCH: Rep. Doug Collins’ full questioning of committee lawyers | Trump impeachment hearings,News & Politics,1074627,"8,662",671,"Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, questioned Republican counsel Stephen Castor and Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman on Dec. 9. The questioning came on the second day of public hearings by the House Judiciary Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. In a tense moment, Collins urged Goldman to reveal who asked for phone numbers that were included in the impeachment report. “I’m going to go on record and tell you I’m not going to reveal how we conducted this investigation,” Goldman said. “And that’s the problem we have with this entire thing,” Collins said. When Goldman tried to interject, Collins said, “I’m done with you for right now.” The Judiciary and Intelligence committees have led the probe, hearing testimony from witnesses and legal experts about Trump’s conduct. House lawmakers are currently drafting the articles of impeachment, on which House lawmakers are anticipated to vote in the coming weeks. The impeachment case has revolved around a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked the president of Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.For more on who’s who in the Trump impeachment inquiry, read: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics...Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSnapchat: @pbsnewsSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe",PT16M10S,2019-12-09,2019-12-09,211453,PBS NewsHour,/channel/UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,20,JCpbg_ycAlU

Epidemics and the end of humankind | Rosalind Eggo | TEDxThessaloniki,Nonprofits & Activism,266193,"3,767",180,"From the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, humankind has lived in fear of a potent infectious disease that would mark its demise. Dr Rosalind Eggo is a mathematical modeller who tracks the spread of deadly viruses, in an attempt to stop them. In this talk, she combines science with humour and answers the question we all want to ask: “Will a pandemic mark the end of humankind?” Rosalind Eggo is an Assistant Professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in the UK. She received her PhD in the dynamics of the 1918 influenza pandemic from Imperial College London, and then worked at The University of Texas at Austin, USA. Rosalind works in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. This means she uses computational and mathematical methods to understand the transmission of pathogens through populations. The aim of infectious disease modelling is to understand the routes and mechanisms that drive the spread of infections, so that we can ultimately design interventions to prevent them. Rosalind has worked on analysis of pandemic influenza, Ebola, Zika, cholera, and other pathogens.

Mathematical Challenges to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution,News & Politics,1326442,"26,188","3,299","Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathe...Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin’s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin’s theory in their two books and essay, respectively The Deniable Darwin, Darwin’s Doubt, and “Giving Up Darwin” (published in the Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term “species” has not been defined by the authors to Darwin’s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin’s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): “Beauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe—walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track—most of the time.” Gelernter notes that there’s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture—not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin’s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Loose Ends: String Theory and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory,Science & Technology,505960,"6,172",313,"Thirty-five years ago string theory took physics by storm, promising the coveted unified theory of nature’s forces that Einstein valiantly sought but never found. In the intervening decades, string theory has brought a collection of mind-boggling possibilities into the lexicon of mainstream thinking—extra dimensions of space, holographic worlds, and multiple universes. Some researchers view these developments as symptoms of string theory having lost its way. Others argue that string theory, although very much still a work in progress, is revealing stunning new qualities of reality. Join leading minds in theoretical physics for a whirlwind ride through the twists and turns of string theory—its past, its future, and what it tells us about the search for the universe’s final theory.PARTICIPANTS: Marcelo Gleiser, Michael Dine, Andrew StromingerMODERATOR: Brian GreeneMORE INFO ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND PARTICIPANTS: https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/...This program is part of the BIG IDEAS SERIES, made possible with support from the JOHN TEMPLETON FOUNDATION.- SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel and ""ring the bell"" for all the latest videos from WSF - VISIT our Website: http://www.worldsciencefestival.com - LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/worldscience...-  FOLLOW us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/WorldSciFestTOPICS0:03 - Opening film3:54 - Program introduction5:40 - Marcelo Gleiser introduction6:26 - Unification of electricity and magnetism10:30 - Unification of space and time13:49 - Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity18:38 - Standard model of particle physics21:56 - Supersymmetry26:14 - The Island of Knowledge32:01 - Godel’s Incompleteness Theorems34:27 - String Theory explainer film37:07 - Michael Dine introduction38:35 - Supersymmetry and the spectrum of particles42:18 - Large Hadron Collider44:57 - Extra dimensions of space50:34 - Dark energy and multiple universes56:40 - Progress since the 1980s and the future of particle physics59:55 - Andrew Strominger introduction1:00:53 - Einstein and black holes1:03:59 - The black hole information paradox1:07:30 - Stephen Hawking’s insights into black holes1:12:00 - Using string theory to understand black holes1:19:33 - Conformal symmetry1:22:48 - Andrew Strominger’s view of string theoryCREDITS- Produced by Laura Dattaro- Associate Produced by Peter Goldberg- Editing and Animation by Josh Zimmerman- Music provided by APM- Additional images and footage provided by: Getty Images, Shutterstock, Videoblocks, Event Horizon Telescope- Recorded at NYU Skirball Center",PT87M24S,2019-08-02,2019-08-02,14324,World Science Festival,/channel/UCShHFwKyhcDo3g7hr4f1R8A,UCShHFwKyhcDo3g7hr4f1R8A,19,YSWd21z2qqE

Why do we believe things that aren't true? | Philip Fernbach | TEDxMileHigh,Nonprofits & Activism,523052,"9,575",546,"It seems like we're living in an epidemic of false belief.

In this fascinating and hilarious talk, cognitive scientist Philip Fernbach peels back the layers of what we really know and reveals some surprising truths about the human mind. Philip Fernbach is a cognitive scientist and professor in the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Co-author of The Knowledge Ilusion: Why We Never Think Alone, Philip's research focuses on why we think we know more than we actually do and the implications this has on individuals and society. He lives in Boulder with his wife and two children. In his free time, he plays bluegrass music and ice hockey.

"14-year-old Bobby Fischer vs Dr. Max Euwe | The ""Unpublished"" Game | 1957",Education,400485,"4,337",188,"The is the 2nd of a 2-game exhibition match played at the Manhattan Chess Club New York, 1957 between 14-year-old talent Bobby Fischer, and Max Euwe, the 5th World Chess Champion. This game went unpublished for over 50 years until Frank Brady unearthed Fischer's score sheet of it. Unlike the first game between Euwe and Fischer, this one was a closely contested fight which reached the final phase. Fischer had white, opening with the Ruy Lopez, and in reply Euwe selected an open system. Despite this open choice by Euwe, the game proceeded positionally, where imbalances in material and minor pieces soon surfaced. The game saw Fischer in the driver's seat at the early to mid-game stage, but the Euwe found a way to fight back some in the final phase. What resulted in the end, was a surprise.PGN:1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4 6.d4 b5 7.Bb3 d5 8.dxe5 Be6 9.c3 Be7 10.Nbd2 0-0 11.Qe2 Nc5 12.Nd4 Nxb3 13.N2xb3 Qd7 14.Nxc6 Qxc6 15.Be3 Qc4 16.Qd2 c5 17.Na5 Qh4 18.Nc6 Rfe8 19.g3 Qh5 20.Nxe7+ Rxe7 21.Bxc5 Rc7 22.Bd4 Bg4 23.f4 Rc6 24.a4 bxa4 25.Rxa4 Rh6 26.Qf2 Bf5 27.Rfa1 Rc8 28.Rb4 Rg6 29.Rb6 Rxb6 30.Bxb6 Qg4 31.Bd4 h5! 32.Rf1 Bd3 33.Re1 Rc6 34.Re3 Be4 35.Qe2 Qf5 36.Kf2 h4 37.Ke1 hxg3 38.hxg3 Rh6 39.Kd2 Bb1 40.Rf3 Rh1 41.Rf1Internet Chess Club (ICC)Software: Blitzinhttp://bit.ly/179O93NDiscount Code: CHESSNETWORKI'm a self-taught National Master in chess out of Pennsylvania, USA who was introduced to the game by my father in 1988 at the age of 8.

What Most People Don't Know About Tiffany Trump,Entertainment,399039,"2,932",423,"While the world is keeping Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. under a microscope, you'd be surprised what most people don't know about Tiffany Trump. The Trump family is constantly making headlines, especially with a lot of the patriarch, President Donald Trump's political antics. The press might be making a circus out of topics such as the border wall, possible Russian collusion, Melania's previous modeling career, and many other controversial subjects about the Trump clan, but Tiffany Trump has managed to grow up to becoming a stunning and surprising woman on her own. What does Tiffany & Co. and the Trump family have in common? They both have an insatiable love for diamonds, which is why Donald Trump and second wife Marla Maples decided to name their daughter in 1993. Marla Maples may have taken daughter Tiffany Trump over to the west coast after her marriage with Donald Trump ended, Tiffany grew up with a much quieter life away from the spotlight. Though she did end up going living to the family legacy by attending the University of Pennsylvania. Ultimately, Tiffany embraced some of her fame as she's becoming a social media starlet among her peers, such as Kyra Kennedy, Andrew Warren, and Gaia Jacquet-Matisse. While trying to keep a low profile, Tiffany did speak on her father's behalf at the Republican National Convention. Want to know something even more surprising?

Who Is Jared Kushner? Narrated By Anna Akana | NowThis,News & Politics,110610,"1,937",258,"We know him as Ivanka Trump’s husband, senior advisor to President Trump, and heir to a $1.8 billion dollar real estate empire that was tarnished with tax evasion scandal. So, Who is Jared Kushner? Here's what you should know about Trump’s one percent-er son-in-law. Narrated by: Anna Akana. » Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe» Sign up for our newsletter KnowThis to get the biggest stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox: https://go.nowth.is/KnowThisWho is Jared Kushner? He started out a simple rich boy of a New Jersey real estate developer Charles Kushner who was the son of immigrants. He was also one of the top Democratic party donors in the country. He also made large donations to institutions of higher learning the Harvard — incidentally where Jared went to college. He later attended NYU, which coincidentally came coupled with another large donation to the school.His father was later sent to prison and Jared took over his empire. The Kushner company sold $1.8 billion in real estate before the housing collapse. He started dating Ivanka Trump, another child of real estate greatness. He also got close with Rupert Murdoch who had a story about his father killed. Over the next few years, his media and real estate ventures started floundering — but then his father in law decided to run for president.Jared joined his campaign and became an integral part of many important decisions. He even would allegedly listen in on phone calls that Trump was making, but the recipients of the calls wouldn’t be made aware. Since Trump's victory, Kushner’s previous business dealings started to conveniently flourish. He remains a senior advisor in the Trump White House.Fast forward to early January of 2020 when President Trump authorized a drone strike that killed Iran’s top security and intelligence commander Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. It’s unclear how we can, in Jared’s words, quote “imagine a new reality for the middle east” while the U.S. is bombing it.For more on Jared Kushner, the Trump Administration, and U.S. politics, subscribe to NowThis News. #JaredKushner #Politics #News #NowThis #NowThisNewsConnect with NowThis» Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook» Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter» Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram» Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_SnapchatNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.

"1st documentary movie on the origin of CCP virus, Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus",News & Politics,1903676,"36,903","1,855","As the world is gripped by the ongoing pandemic, many questions remain about the origin of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus—commonly known as the novel coronavirus.Join Epoch Times senior investigative reporter Joshua Philipp as he explores the known facts surrounding the CCP virus and the global pandemic it caused.In his investigation, Philipp explores the scientific data, and interviews top scientists and national security experts. And while the mystery surrounding the virus's origin remains, much is learned about the CCP's cover-up that led to the pandemic and the threat it poses to the world.Editor's note:From the start of the virus outbreak in China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not been forthcoming with information about the virus. In the early days of the outbreak, medical professionals who sounded the alarm were reprimanded by police for spreading ""rumors.""Initially, the CCP said the virus originated at the Huanan Seafood Market, even though it knew patient zero had no connection with the market. Fearing that it might be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic, the CCP shifted its narrative to suggest that the virus originated in the United States and was brought to China by the U.S. military.As a leading voice in covering China for the past 20 years, we understand very well the CCP's deceptive nature and its history of cover-ups. With this outbreak, we saw a case of history repeating itself—in 2003, we exposed the CCP's cover-up of the SARS epidemic in China, far ahead of other media.In this documentary, we present viewers with the known scientific data and facts surrounding the origin of the virus along with experts’ opinions. We don't draw conclusions, but we point out that serious questions remain about the origins of the virus as well as the CCP's handling of the outbreak.Some of our viewers felt the documentary was taking a position on the origin of the virus, which was not our intent. The documentary has been slightly updated as of April 14 to better reflect our position, which is not to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present the known facts.#ccpvirus #wuhan #coronavirus- - - - - - - - -Sign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party▶️https://ccpvirustruth.com- - - - - - - - -Subscribe for updates: http://bit.ly/CrossroadsYTMake a donation:  https://donorbox.org/crossroads-joshu...https://twitter.com/crossroads_joshFollow us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/CrossroadsET- - - - - - - - -Hosted by @JoshJPhilipphttps://twitter.com/JoshJPhilippSUBSCRIBE TO THE EPOCH TIMESPrint subscription (delivery inside the U.S only):https://theepochtimes.f2vr2q.net/q9BobProduced by @EpochTimeshttps://twitter.com/EpochTimes- - - - - - - - -WATCH MORE ON YOUTUBE🔵 Escape from Wuhan: 55,000 People Flee; Second Wave Of Outbreaks? | CCP virus | Crossroads https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDI9e...🔵 Ending lockdowns in Wuhan?

"Change Your Closet, Change Your Life | Gillian Dunn | TEDxWhiteRock",Nonprofits & Activism,1199902,"33,498","1,202","We live in abundance, but suffer from a scarcity mindset. This talk was born out of a candle melting in the closet before the chance of being lit, and sent Gillian on a journey of discovering why. This talk takes you through why we, as humans, stockpile stuff, the mindsets that drive this action, and why it is imperative that we change before it's too late. Gillian utilizes research, personal experience and stories from the Emergency Department to remind us that we must choose everyday what kind of life we want to live. Gillian Dunn works as a Registered Nurse in the Emergency Department. She loves the fast pace, interacting with people from all walks of life, and putting structure and organization into an environment that is often chaos. She often receives two responseswhen she tells people she works in the Emergency “I could never do that!” and “Oh man, one time I was in emerg and...” She is very interested in a simple and intentional life. In the last year, she has really tried to simplify her life so that she has time for the things she enjoys and wants to focus on. This has left more room for learning, growing and challenging herself. She believes it’s the little things in life that turn out to be big in the end, and she is trying to focus on those little things.

Bobby Fischer beats a Grandmaster in 10 moves! (But Reshevsky plays on),Entertainment,3063251,"29,016","1,900","THANK YOU FOR 2.000.000 VIEWS! :)Check out some of my other videos as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcT1e...Once Bobby Fischer made his debut at age 14 in the U.S. Championship with the 1957–58 event, he dominated completely, winning on each of his eight attempts, leaving Reshevsky, the seven-time former champion, back in the chasing pack. There was little love lost between the two players, separated by a generation in age. Ahead of the Buenos Aires 1960 tournament, Reshevsky reportedly said, ""I would settle for 19th place – if Fischer placed 20th."" Reshevsky in fact won the Buenos Aires 1960 tournament, with Fischer well back; this was the only time Reshevsky finished ahead of Fischer in an international tournament.In 1961 Reshevsky began a 16-game match with the then-current U.S. Champion Fischer; it was jointly staged in New York and Los Angeles. Despite Fischer's recent meteoric rise, consensus opinion favored Reshevsky. After eleven games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer Jacqueline Piatigorsky, with Reshevsky receiving the winner's share of the prize fund.In the 1967 Sousse Interzonal, Fischer turned up 53 minutes late (only seven minutes short of an automatic time forfeiture) for his game with Reshevsky, and made his opening move without a word of apology. Reshevsky, who had been convinced that Fischer had withdrawn from the tournament, lost the game badly and complained furiously to the organizers. Despite losing that game, Reshevsky advanced to the next stage. Reshevsky also refused to play for the U.S. team in the Chess Olympiads of 1960, 1962 and 1966 because Fischer, as U.S. champion, was chosen ahead of him for the top board. He did, however, finally consent to play on a lower board in 1970, the only time the two men appeared in the same team.Although Reshevsky and Fischer had one of the fiercest rivalries in chess history, Fischer greatly respected the older champion, stating in the late 1960s that he thought Reshevsky was the strongest player in the world in the mid-1950s, around the time when he defeated world champion Mikhail Botvinnik in their four-game mini-match, which was the top board of the USA vs USSR team match held in Moscow.It was only in 1968, in his 57th year, that he finally lost a match where he had time for extensive preparation. This was against Viktor Korchnoi in Amsterdam in the first round of the Candidates. The match was scheduled for ten games but the younger Grandmaster proved too much for Reshevsky, who didn't win a game and lost by the final score of 5½–2½.During his long chess career, Reshevsky played eleven of the first twelve World Champions, from Emanuel Lasker to Anatoly Karpov, the only player to do so (he met Garry Kasparov but never played him). He defeated seven World Champions: Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, and Bobby Fischer.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal, Bitcoin or Litecoin.Link to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmatorBitcoin address 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZLitecoin address LbSuZuBffDCNmr5CSZbY7W2zM83w4ZvnC7Check out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOw...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...Twitter: https://twitter.com/agadmatorInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/Lichess: https://lichess.org/@/agadmatorChess.com: agadmatorSkype: agadmatorLeague of Legends: agadmator :)Check out my Hearthstone channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDKe...",PT5M37S,2017-07-04,2017-07-04,221112,agadmator's Chess Channel,/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,19,CxzBKhVaRkU

How modern families increase social inequality | The Economist,News & Politics,479182,"12,067","1,517","Modern families with two working adults are richer than those with a single breadwinner, and can afford to take a different approach to parenting. This is exacerbating inequality between rich and poor families.Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy The family has always been a central building block of society. But families have changed dramatically in the rich world over the past 50 years. Changes to society mean that the old model of a breadwinning husband and a stay-at-home wife has all but collapsed. And the different ways rich and poor families raise their children are increasing social inequality. Today, gay families like Maggie and Joelle’s are widely accepted in the rich world. A generation ago, it was almost unthinkable that same-sex couples would get married.But now most people in rich countries think gay marriage is fine. Fears that gay marriages would undermine heterosexual ones have proven unfounded. And this is one reason why marriage equality has spread so extraordinarily fast. Before 2001 gay marriage was not legal anywhere in the world. Since then, it’s been legalised in nearly all rich countries and developing nations are starting to follow suit. It’s a far cry from the 1960s, when families typically consisted of a dad who went to work a stay-at-home mum and three or more kids. Better access for women to contraception education and jobs has changed this traditional family portrait. Across the globe, families are shrinking. Nowhere more so than in South Korea. Here a growing number of women are rejecting marriage and having children altogether like Go Lee, who is 26. She says traditional employers make it hard to combine a career with marriage and motherhood. Go works in IT, but is also a vlogger on YouTube, where she urges South Korean women to be more assertive. She believes South Korean men are part of the problemMany expect their wives to do all the housework and childcare, even if they have a job. There is a huge mismatch of expectations around marriage in South Korea. Most men want a 1950s-style relationship whereas women want something more modern and equal. The result is they often end up not marrying or having kids at all  and that’s left South Korea with a problem. Its population is in free fall. In 1960 the average South Korean woman had six children. In 2018 that figure shrank to less than one. A fertility rate of one means each generation is half as big as the previous one and in South Korea this means there are fewer workers to support the country’s ageing population. In rural areas, men are viewed as poor prospects by South Korean women. So the government is helping these men to find brides from poorer countries.State-funded assimilation centres like this, teach immigrant brides how to cook Korean food how to speak Korean and even how to deal with Korean mothers-in-law. Like most of her classmates studying here today 19-year-old Nguyen Thi Cam Thuy is from Vietnam. She recently married a South Korean man 40-year-old Kim Dae Hyun who found her through a matchmaking website. Over a fifth of married South Korean farmers and fishermen have tied the knot with a foreigner. But cross-cultural unions can be difficult and around a fifth of marriages between South Korean men and foreign women end in divorce within four years. This video of a man beating his foreign wife caused widespread outrage. 50 years ago in most rich countries domestic violence was considered normal. Now, it is universally condemned and rates have fallen sharply by three-quarters in America alone, since the mid-1990s. Today, other factors are more likely to affect the stability of families and these are contributing to a growing gulf between middle-class and working-class families. In most rich countries, if you don’t go to university you are more likely to have kids outside of marriage. And women who don’t finish high school are more likely to end up as single mothers than women who have a degree. In Jamie’s hometown of Hartlepool in north-east England, 70% of babies are born outside marriage like her twins, Sean and Liam. In Hartlepool in the 1960s men did heavy work in shipyards and factories which was much better paid than any job their wives could find. So the women stayed at home with the kids. But as technology advances manual work has dried up and uneducated men have struggled to find good jobs. If the only men available lack steady jobs and don’t help around the home some women feel they are better off alone. Middle-class families have remained solid in rich countries over the past 50 years while working-class families have grown much less stable. Women with a university degree are more likely than women who do not finish high school to be married and raise children with their husband as a team.",PT18M36S,2019-11-18,2019-11-18,115533,The Economist,/channel/UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,20,hSmAYUnZyxE

Did you know today's youth view sex as no more meaningful than a handshake?  Did you know what they will often perform oral sex on a stranger they just met at a party but not kiss them as that's too personal? That's tame compared to a lot of what Lisa has heard in her 40+ years of experience of working with and raising kids.Parenting should be Fun & Easy. Get all the hard work done when they're little then relax & enjoy. Yes, there's some tweaking during the teen years, but otherwise ... easy.My methods are based on 40+ years of experience of working with & raising kids. I use what works, not what people think “should” work. If the respect isn't mutual, it's useless.Be the Fun Parent, not the Friend. What's the difference?

He runs the bicycle mechanics lab and teaches mechanics. Whenever Arend comes up with an assignment for his students, the hallway of the faculty is crammed with all sorts of very strange objects that resemble bikes only slighlty. Considering bicyles constitute 40% of the Netherlands traffic making it the bicycle capital of the world, his work is very interesting  not only for the dutch people but anyone who ever rode a bicycle.Amongst his fields of interest are: Multibody Dynamics, dynamics of flexible multibody system, finite element method, legged locomotion, speed skating, and bicycle dynamics. In particular the treatment of contact phenomena like in collisions and rolling (non-holonomic constraints) is his special interest. He has given academic talks related to his area of expertise in various universities all over the world. However, the concept of TED is relatively new to him and he is very excited to present his intriguing research at such a grand platform.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM,Nonprofits & Activism,6695159,"91,392","13,585","Is this person flirting with me? This question has plagued us from nearly the beginning of time. Social anthropologist Jean Smith, or ‘flirtologist’ if you will, demonstrates her 6 simple steps known as “H.O.T.  A.P.E.” to help answer that very question. And it will forever change your perception of flirting from being a stranger’s evaluation of your worth into what it should be: a fun game! Jean's purpose in life is understanding how people flirt. And people flirt differently in different cultures. She uses her background as a  cultural and social anthropologist to help teach people how to flirt – to gain confidence and happiness in their lives by assisting them to projective a positive image of themselves. , she uses research and  studies to emphasize the skills that we can all learn to interact more effectively. Jean also uses practical activities and interaction to bridge the brain and the body and apply the information to make our daily lives more rewarding. The basis of Jeans teachings comes from her background as a social anthropologist.. A few years ago, Jean published, The Flirt Interpreter, which is an accessible analysis of the research she conducted into the flirting behaviour of people in the cities of London, New York, Paris and Stockholm. She conducted 250 face-to-face interviews to ascertain flirting behaviour. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Catching A Serial Killer! America's Worst...Israel Keyes,Entertainment,1120085,"4,742",943,"Documentary that I filmed with the BBC, currently available on Netflix. Don't miss what we're up to next, Please SUBSCRIBE to  to keep up! Responsible for murders in New York, Vermont, Rhode Island, Alaska, Alabama, and possibly more. Dan Oshier Productions - The ""Almost"" final cut of the documentary I did camera and editing work on for The UK's Firstlooktv. (THIS IS A LOW-RESOLUTION COPY, SORRY LEGAL STUFF) Filming on location in Tupper Lake, New York and throughout Vermont. Aerial Video, Camera/ Production Assistant, and video editing.Israel Keyes was an American serial killer, rapist, arsonist, burglar and bank robber. Keyes admitted to violent crimes as early as 1996, with the violent sexual assault of a teenage girl in Oregon. He committed a long series of rapes and murders until his capture in 2012. He was being held in custody, awaiting trial for the murder of Samantha Koenig, when he committed suicide in prison.VictimsKeyes admitted to investigators that he killed four people in Washington, claims which are the subject of an active investigation by the state police and FBI. Keyes did not have a felony criminal record in Washington, although he had been cited in Thurston County for driving without a valid license and, in an earlier incident, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence. Authorities are reviewing unsolved murder and missing persons cases to determine which cases, if any, may link to Keyes.Keyes confessed to at least one murder in New York State. Authorities have not determined the identity, age, or sex of the victim, or when and where the murder may have occurred, but regard the confession as credible. Keyes had ties to New York; he owned ten acres and a run down cabin in the town of Constable. Keyes also confessed to committing bank robberies in New York and Texas. The FBI later confirmed that Keyes robbed the Community Bank branch in Tupper Lake, New York, in April 2009, leaving no casualties. He also told authorities that he burglarized a Texas home and set it on fire.In April 2009, Keyes claimed to have killed a woman in New Jersey and buried her near Tupper Lake in upstate New York. Keyes was also linked to the deaths of Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont. Keyes reportedly broke into the Curriers' home on the night of June 8 and tied them up before driving to an abandoned farmhouse, where he shot Bill before sexually assaulting and strangling Lorraine. However, their bodies have not been found. Two years prior to the Curriers' deaths, Keyes hid a ""murder kit"" near their home which he later used to kill them. After the murders, he moved most of the items to a new hiding place in Parishville, New York, where they remained until after his arrest.Keyes' last known murder was the kidnapping and killing of 18-year-old Samantha Koenig, a barista working in Anchorage, Alaska. Authorities said that Keyes kidnapped her from her place of employment on February 1, 2012, stole her debit card and other property, then murdered her the following day. Police stated that Keyes sexually assaulted Koenig before he murdered her. After Koenig's death, Keyes left on a cruise out of New Orleans, leaving Koenig's body in a shed. When he returned home, he took a photograph of her body with a four-day-old issue of the Anchorage Daily News, maintaining the illusion that she was still alive in his ransom demand. After demanding $30,000 in ransom, Keyes dismembered Koenig and disposed of her body in Matanuska Lake north of Anchorage.Modus operandiKeyes planned murders long ahead of time and took extraordinary action to avoid detection. Unlike most serial killers, he did not have a victim profile. He usually killed far from home, and never in the same area twice. On his murder trips, he kept his mobile phone turned off and paid for items with cash. He had no connection to any of his victims. In the Currier murders, he flew to Chicago, and there rented a car to drive the 1000 additional miles to Vermont. He then used the murder kit he had hidden two years earlier to perform the murders.Keyes admired Ted Bundy and shared several similarities with him: Both were methodical and felt a possession over their victims. However, there are notable differences. Bundy's murders were spread throughout the country, mainly because he lived in many different areas, and not as an intentional effort to avoid detection as was the case with Keyes. Bundy targeted only attractive young women, usually with hair parted down the middle, while Keyes had no particular type of victim.Zodiak Media FirstLooktv in the UK.Thanks Will Hanrahan and crew!

Lose Weight AND Keep It Off: Emotional Eating | Renée Jones | TEDxWilmingtonLive,Nonprofits & Activism,289820,"6,426",186,"Most diets, detoxes, or pills promise overnight and effortless weight loss, but it never lasts, and 'yo-yo dieting' leads to greater and more demoralizing weight gain.  We typically follow the diet until something drives us to the refrigerator for comfort or stress relief.  Renée Jones shows you how to get free from the emotional eating that sabotages every diet. -After 40 years on a diet, yo-yoing up and down the scale, Renée Jones had learned every diet – and every cheat – before finally stopping the comfort eating and self-sabotage to lose “those last 30 pounds” AGAIN in 2012 – but this time she maintained her goal weight.  Who knew that was truly possible? With a Master’s degree in Marriage and Family Counseling and a Clinical Residency in Pastoral Care, she has an international counseling and coaching practice utilizing traditional and contemporary models as well as relaxation and horse-assisted methods to help others win at losing extra weight and other baggage they’ve dragged with them for decades.  Her first book was ""What’s Really Eating You: Overcome the Triggers of Comfort Eating.""

PART 1: Inspector General FISA Investigation President Trump - Senate Hearing,News & Politics,187156,"2,250",160,"The U.S. attorney who is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of the origins of the Trump-Russia probe released a rare statement Monday saying he disagrees with conclusions of the so-called FISA report -- after DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz found in that review that the probe's launch largely complied with DOJ and FBI policies.“Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened,” U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a statement.Horowitz released his report Monday saying his investigators found no intentional misconduct or political bias surrounding efforts to launch that 2016 probe and to seek a highly controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in the early months of the investigation. Still, it found that there were ""significant concerns with how certain aspects of the investigation were conducted and supervised.""“I have the utmost respect for the mission of the Office of Inspector General and the comprehensive work that went into the report prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff,” Durham said. “However, our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department. Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.”As Horowitz has conducted his review of DOJ actions during the Russia probe, Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, has also been conducting a wider inquiry into alleged misconduct and alleged improper government surveillance on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.Fox News reported in October that Durham's ongoing probe has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation.Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr ripped the FBI’s “intrusive” investigation after the release of Horowitz’s review, saying it was launched based on the “thinnest of suspicions.”“The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,” Barr said in a statement.Barr expressed frustration that the FBI continued investigating the Trump campaign, even as “exculpatory” information came to the light.",PT135M26S,2019-12-11,2019-12-11,211153,FOX 10 Phoenix,/channel/UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,20,627To5P1urE

We've flagged this talk for falling outside TEDx's curatorial guidelines. This talk only represents the speaker’s personal views and experiences with diet, chronic illness, molecular biology, and human health. Certain statements and claims are not yet supported by legitimate scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...Dr. Klaper says he had an awakening while putting people to sleep. When we awaken to the damage that a meat-based diet creates in our body and the toll that the industrial production of animal flesh inflicts upon our planet, we then become aware that the single most effective action anyone can take to improve their personal health and help heal our injured planet is to reduce, or better, eliminate their consumption of meat. Dr. Michael Klaper is a gifted clinician, internationally recognized teacher, and sought-after speaker on diet and health. He has practiced medicine for more than 40 years and is a leading educator in applied plant-based nutrition and integrative medicine. He is also the author of a successful book on cholesterol-free nutrition and an upcoming title (to be announced in 2018), as well as numerous DVDs and Videos on Demand, a series of “Healthy YOU Webinars,” and dozens of articles. A source of inspiration advocating plant-based diets and the end of animal cruelty worldwide, Dr. Klaper contributed to the making of two PBS television programs Food for Thought and the award-winning Diet for a New America movie based on the book of the same name.

Battle Stations - SR-71 Blackbird Stealth Plane -Full Documentary,Science & Technology,7636691,"29,530","2,873","The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird (so named for its heat-resistant black paint) first flew in 1964, and since that time it has remained the world's fastest aircraft. Tanks in the inner wings and upper fuselage carry the 80,000 pounds of special, superheated fuel. Few weapon systems have ever entered the military arena with such blinding superiority as did the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. No weapon system has ever maintained that same degree of superiority over a period of four decades. Today, the Blackbird is still the fastest, highest-flying, most-effective reconnaissance aircraft in history, even though budgetary considerations have caused it to be withdrawn from active service.Like the U-2, a product of the U.S. government's super-secret Skunk Works research & development center, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird is a perfect expression of Kelly Johnson's genius and his leadership of a brilliant team of fewer than 200 engineers.The USAF's SR-71 was a two-seat development of the earlier A-12 aircraft used by the Central Intelligence Agency. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird first flew on December 22, 1964, and by December 1967, all 31 of the Blackbirds had been delivered to the USAF.The Blackbird was both a miracle of design and of production, for its performance (speed of Mach 3.2, more than 90,000 feet of altitude, a 4,000-mile range) had to overcome not only the sound barrier, but also the heat barrier. Skin temperatures of the craft exceeded 1,050 degrees Fahrenheit. Special fuels, hydraulic fluids, electronics, and glass had to be developed to match the strength of the aircraft's titanium structure.A Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, flown invariably by a highly skilled crew, became an invulnerable, invaluable reconnaissance aircraft. Unlike satellites in fixed orbits, the SR-71 could be deployed within hours to anywhere in the world.The usefulness of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird went beyond military applications to diplomatic roles. During the 1973 Middle East Yom Kippur War, reconnaissance photos taken by the SR-71 determined the positions of the advancing Israeli forces, and were used during subsequent peace negotiations. And as a research instrument, the SR-71 has few peers; although officially retired, Blackbirds are rumored to be occasionally flown -- ""unofficially"" -- in NASA research.Blackbirds set many records for speed and altitude, the last one a transcontinental speed record of less than 68 minutes -- on the delivery flight of a retired SR-71 to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.LOCKHEED SR-71 BLACKBIRD SPECIFICATIONSWingspan: 55 ft. 7 in.Length: 107 ft. 5 in.Height: 18 ft. 6 in.Empty Weight: 60,000 lbsGross Weight: 170,000 lbsTop Speed: Mach 3.2-plusService Ceiling: 90,000 ft.-plusRange: 2,600 milesEngine/Thrust: Two Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojets/32,500 lbs eachCrew: 2Equipment: Wide range of classified intelligence-gathering equipment",PT64M1S,2015-12-05,2015-12-05,142411,Molo,/channel/UC26RY5tqw1ziYyajhFNanUQ,UC26RY5tqw1ziYyajhFNanUQ,20,YJ5FjVOvkB0

Prisoner Yoshie Shiratori had had enough. He was forced to confess to a murder he did not commit, falsely imprisoned in Aomori Prison, beaten and tortured every night by prison guards, and, now worse, prosecutors were seeking the death penalty. In his mind, it was time to go; but Aomori Prison wasn’t the easiest to escape. Regardless, Yoshie Shiratori had nothing to lose, and so at 5:30 am he made his move. He knew there would be a 15 minute gap in the patrol time as he had studied the guards’ routine for months; and when the coast was clear, he pulled out a metal wire (which he had smuggled in from the bathhouse) and started to pick the lock. (This was originally the metal support ring that was wrapped around the bathing buckets inmates used to wash themselves). His hands were stiff from the wintry cold, but after a few minutes of picking, he had success, and his cell door swung open. But he wasn’t out of the woods yet, because there were more locked doors ahead.

Learn why rainfall is an essential part of each flowering. And every small step – part of the journey to the highest peek. The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art –Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. “The universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance”, says master Yi.  And as for flying – yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020.

I Lived Like Elon Musk for a Week But One Day Was Enough,Howto & Style,1607062,"57,350","1,772","They say success is a mindset. No offense to whoever “they” are, but that doesn’t really help most people much. So what about a real-life example to live by? If you've got problems with procrastinating, feeling overwhelmed by all the stuff you need to get done, and just overall pitiful time management skills, this is what can help you. Okay, now, who's one of the most successful and productive dudes out there? You're right! It's Elon Musk! This guy is a productivity ninja who’s mastered the art of time management. He heads multiple companies, the most well-known being Tesla and SpaceX, and has admitted that he works 100 hours a week or more! Let's try to follow his typical schedule for a week.

Much to my dismay, the first thing I found out is that he wakes up at 7am every single day and functions on just 6 hours of sleep!-  I’m a pretty traditional guy – I like to get my recommended 7-9 hours of shuteye each night, so 6 hours was not enough.- Elon Musk skips breakfast… Well, at least he drinks coffee! To be honest, the first couple of days with no breakfast hit me hard. - One of Musk’s golden productivity rules is to work in a 5-minute block system, which means that for 5-minutes, I had to stay completely focused on one thing and then switch to another. - Some of my projects take hours to finish. But by breaking them down into smaller steps that I spent less time on, in the end, it took me fewer hours to get my projects done! - The first day, what used to take me a solid 8 hours to do ended up taking me just 6. By the week’s end, I’d cut that number down to 4! - As for phone calls, Elon suggests NOT taking any calls during the day except for emergencies.- I really saved a lot of time on the email thing. I would’ve never guessed I was wasting so much time going through my inbox! - So, I hit the gym twice this week, and, I gotta say, I think I understand where Musk gets his energy – working out really does charge your battery, so to speak.   - Getting 6 hours of sleep is not for me, but I like getting up at 7 and having time to plan my day ahead. So, I’ll hit the sack at 12am to get that precious extra hour of shuteye.  - And I’ll spend some of that extra hour on a good breakfast. Even if experts say you can go without, I’d prefer to fill my tank before I head to work!- Planning the day ahead and tackling tasks in 5-minute blocks will be my new norm.- I’ll continue ditching my phone during work hours and keeping the emailing at a minimum because this saved me loads of time.  - I’m enjoying the gym, and I feel really good! It’s even become a sort of new hobby of mine.- As for the weekends, I need my Saturdays, man! I understand Elon has a lot on his plate, but I’m no CEO or entrepreneur, so I can afford to take 2 days off a week instead of just one.

Don’t get hangry: feed your brain healthy food | Brad Bushman | TEDxColumbus,Nonprofits & Activism,769900,"7,086",512,"One of the two best predictors of success in life is self-control (the other is intelligence). Professor Brad Bushman has been studying human aggression for over 25 years. Aggression often starts when self-control stops. Bushman discusses his research on the link between low self-control and aggression. He focuses on the link between levels of glucose (blood sugar) and self-control. Glucose provides our brain with the fuel it needs to exercise self-control, including control of angry feelings and aggressive impulses. Bushman’s research shows that when people become hungry, they also tend to become angry and aggressive, captured by the term “hangry” (hungry+angry). Healthy foods like veggies, fruits, and whole grains can make people less hangry. Self-control can also be strengthened, like a muscle, through exercise.Brad J. Bushman (Ph.D. 1989, University of Missouri) is a professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University, and a professor of communication science at the VU University, Amsterdam. He holds the Margaret Hall and Robert Randal Rinehart Chair of Mass Communication. For over 25 years he has studied the causes, consequences, and solutions to the problem of human aggression and violence. He is a member of President Obama’s committee on gun violence, and has testified before the U.S. Congress on the topic of youth violence. He has published over 170 peer-reviewed journal articles. According to Google Scholar, his articles have been cited over 25,000 times. He is ranked #2 among communication scholars cited in Google Scholar. In 2014 he received the Distinguished Lifetime Contribution to Media Psychology and Technology, American Psychological Association. His research has challenged several myths (e.g., violent media have a trivial effect on aggression, venting anger reduces aggression, violent people suffer from low self-esteem, violence and sex sell products, warning labels reduce audience size). (One of his colleagues calls him the “myth buster.”) His research has been published in the top scientific journals (e.g., Science, PNAS), and has been featured extensively in the mass media (e.g., BBC, New York Times, NPR).In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.

The death of Adolf Hitler | DW Documentary,Education,315995,"4,260",265,"Adolf Hitler committed suicide in his bunker as the Red Army closed in on Berlin on April 30, 1945. But legends about the Nazi dictator's lived on. Was his body ever found? Did he manage to escape?After Hitler, aides poured gasoline on his body and set it alight in the garden of his chancellery. A few days later, the Soviets discovered the remains. But the body was burned beyond recognition, and they could not be sure it was his. Only after a top-secret investigation could Hitler be positively identified, thanks to information provided by his dentist. At the same time, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin publicly stated that his army had been unable to find Hitler’s body. Wild rumors swirled about Hitler's death. Stalin even accused some of the Allies of helping him escape. What were the secrets behind this deception? What happened to the two German women who helped identify Hitler's body?-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We at Janson Media uploads on the daily so stay tuned for more videos of your interest!George Westinghouse changed the face of the world with his inventions, patents, business sense, and personality.Not a day goes by that we don't use something pioneered by George Westinghouse. He is the forgotten role model that our country needs today to teach future generations of Americans that hard work and kindness pay off. George Westinghouse was one of the most successful men in the world. A respected engineer, inventor and America's greatest industrialist. He was a pioneer of the industrial revolution and played a leading role in turning the United States from a young agrarian society into a modern economic powerhouse. The name ""Westinghouse"" has been a household name the world over for more than 100 years because of one man, his love of machines, and his desire to make the world a better place.The accomplishments that George Westinghouse had in his lifetime had a major impact on the way we live today.His work in the railroad industry with the Westinghouse air brake, the electrification of the world with Westinghouse alternating current, him being instrumental in developing natural gas as a fuel, and his impact on the shipping industry with the Westinghouse geared marine turbine engine. George Westinghouse was known as a good person.He always had a very good rapport with his workers. There was never a strike at any of the Westinghouse companies all the time he had control of them. And, you know, that was not common back in those days. He certainly was not motivated by greed or money. He really thought that his accomplishments would benefit mankind. And that alone was a driving force for him. This film also engages in the power struggle between Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla.▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽🎥Share this video through this link! https://youtu.be/8BUpF__h-IY🎥Subscribe Here! http://geni.us/JansonMediaYT▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽▽▼▽Search for Related KeywordsWestinghouseWestinghouse MovieWestinghouse Movie TrailerWestinghouse Movie ClipWestinghouse  ClipWestinghouse TrailerWestinghouse Russian MovieWestinghouse EdisonWestinghouse TeslaWestinghouse IndustrializationJansonJanson MediaJanson Media Company★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★At Janson Media, we are always looking for quality, engaging content across a wide range of genres.

But that doesn't mean that they can't set up subtle traps to confuse their opponents. In fact, if your opponent doesn't make a mistake, you can't win!Studying Bobby Fischer's games, IM Valeri Lilov discovered that he was a much trickier player than everybody thinks. But his traps were so subtle than even strong GMs couldn't avoid them!So, he is now sharing his discoveries analyzing 3 impressive Fischer wins and how he confuse his opponents to do what he want them to do!Fischer - Bednarski: An Opening TrapThe first game shows Bobby playing his favorite 6.Bc4 against the Sicilian Najdorf. Black closes the a2-g8 diagonal with 6...e6, so Fischer was eager to open it with 8.f4, with idea of f4-f5. Black just played 8...Nc5 in the position on the right:Traps FischerBlack is threatening the e4-pawn, which can be easily defended with 9.Qf3 (or even 9.Qe2 if White want to prepare e4-e5). But, instead, White decided to go with the direct 9.f5!?, putting immediate pressure over the e6-pawn and gambling the e4-pawn.Black has many normal moves at his disposal: 9...Be7, 9...Nxb3, 9...Bd7 and 9...e5 are all possible, and give Black a normal position. But,, what happen after 9...Nfxe4, even threatening ...Qh4+?We can say that Bednarski was a little naive thinking that Fischer would permit such a seemly strong move without having an stron move against it. But it is so tempting!In fact, Bednarski fell in the trap! After 10.fxe6! Qh4+ 11.g3 Nxg3 12.Nf3 Qh5 13.exf7+ Kd8 14.Rg1 Nf5 15.Nd5! White has a crushing position. The Black king is in a terrible position, while White pieces are very active. White is ready to play Bg5+, Qe2, O-O-O, when Black position whould collapse.You have to watch the full free video to discover how Fischer destroyed his enemy.If you want to discover more powerful Sicilian Sacrifices, you should definately check the Judit Polgar's Method: Judit Polgar’s Secrets of the Sicilian, which you can get with an exclusive discount if you click https://ichs.co/2gx3c8R.Byrne - Fischer: A Tactical TrapThis is one of the most famous Bobby's games, in which he crushed one of the best American players of the time. Black got an impressive position, with good control of the central squares. But, his pawn on d5 is a little weak. That doesn't really matter in this position, as Black is ready to play ...Nd3, blocking the d-file and controlling a lot of important squares.Having said that, White has to fight against this threat. White can move both rooks to d1, then play Qc2, and threaten to take the knight. But, what rook to move?The Ba6 is disturbing in the a6-f1 diagonal, so it sound logical to play 14.Rfd1. But this move weakens the f2-pawn and falls because Fischer's idea. He played 14...Nd3 15.Qc2 Nxf2!All the Elite GMs seeing this game thought that Fischer got crazy, but they didn't discover Fischer's idea until it was too late. After 16.Kxf2 Ng4+ 17.Kg1 Nxe3 18.Qd2 Nxg2! (instead of the analyzed by everyone, 18...Nxd1) the White king is exposed without defenders. Black has a killing attack, that give him the full point only 3 moves later.Fischer - Sherwin: A Positional TrapHiding your own intention is key to set up a good trap. That was something Bobby do like a GM even before he got the title. Take for example the next game, when he plays his beloved King's Indian AttackNeither of the players seems to be doing much. White is developing his pieces, so why Black should be in a hurry to do anything?As a matter of fact, White has a more pleasant position, with a clear plan in mind. But Black didn't find it!White played 9.c3 b4 10.d4 Qc7 11.e5!, and he take full control of the center and started an attack on the kingside.Being subtle with your plans is also a type of positional trap!► Come checkout the iChess.net shop, we have the world’s largest collection of chess videos and chess courses: https://ichs.co/iChessShop**********   Other Videos from iChess    **********  ► Subscribe to our main Youtube Channel: https://ichs.co/iChSubscribe► Check out award winning Master Method video series: https://ichs.co/MasterMethodCheckout our most recent video: https://ichs.co/latest-chess-video********** FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL: ***********Facebook: https://ichs.co/iChessFBTwitter: https://ichs.co/iChessTwitterYouTube: https://ichs.co/iChSubscribe********** Our Other YouTube Channels ***********iChess en español: https://ichs.co/iChessESP",PT40M8S,2017-10-20,2017-10-20,221232,iChess Channel 2,/channel/UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,20,9aSNDtxGl7Q

North Korea - All the dictator's men | DW Documentary,Education,5677987,"39,328","3,177","North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim’s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator’s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Why you feel what you feel | Alan Watkins | TEDxOxford,Nonprofits & Activism,2592469,"40,813","1,582","Understanding why you feel what you feel is one of the most important aspects of human development. After understanding comes control. When you control your emotions through vertical development, you can be more successful and happy.We’ve all seen adults behave like children and ‘throw their toys out of the pram’ if they don’t get their way. An inability to control emotions prevents us from growing up and becoming mature successful human beings. Dr. Alan Watkins, founder of Complete Coherence, introduces the key phases of human development and explains why poor emotional control is holding back progress. He asks us to imagine a world where we never have to feel anything we don’t want to feel; where we have complete control of what we feel and when we feel it.Emotions meet technology in a new app (Universe of Emotions). Taking us on a journey around this Universe, Dr Watkins explains how we can choose our own emotional ‘planetary’ address and live happier and more fulfilled lives.Alan Watkins is CEO and founder of leadership consultancy, Complete Coherence. He is recognized as an international expert on leadership and human performance. Dr Watkins has a broad mix of commercial, academic, scientific and technological abilities. Over the past 18 years he has been a coach to many of Europe’s top business leaders and has helped companies treble share price, enter the FTSE 100, salvage difficult turnarounds and establish market leadership in their industry. He has written five books and numerous peer reviewed scientific articles. He advised the GB Olympic squad prior to London 2012 and is working with them leading up to Rio in 2016.

A Stranger Keeps Visiting Me At Night,Education,1949867,"35,846","1,519","When I was young, I used to dream about a man I could swear I’d never met.I made drawings of his face, but they never matched my dreams.As I grew up, I started to get used to him.He kept appearing in my dreams from time to time, but I stopped paying attention to it. Until a couple of months ago, when everything changed!I had moved back with my parents to the town I was born in.And after a while, he started visiting my dreams again, all the time!I would never get rid of this stalker. He was inside my head.When I  talked to my mom about it, she told me not to pay attention to it. If he was only in my dreams, then he wouldn’t harm me. The other day, I was coming out of school and I felt that someone was staring at me. I looked instinctively and saw him on the other side of the parking lot.I got goosebumps.I turned around to tell my friend, but when I looked again, he was gone.Was I going crazy?We went to the mall and I saw him behind every column and inside every shop.But when I looked closely, he disappeared.My friend got really worried about me too. She couldn’t see him.I was definitely going crazy. That night, the real nightmare began.I went to bed knowing that I would dream about him.But I wasn't ready for what was actually waiting for me.  I was in an open square and I was completely alone.I looked around and saw him approaching.But, when I tried to move, nothing happened.This was new.I was stuck in my place, frozen like a statue, as he started to walk towards me.I could feel a tickling in my arms and my legs as I tried to turn around and get the hell out of there.But I couldn’t move a  muscle, I don’t know why.I was paralyzed.The man got closer and closer and I could feel my heart racing.He didn’t look mad or dangerous, but he didn’t look kind either.His face had no expression.As he got really close, he stretched his arm to touch me.I tried to scream but my voice was gone too.A second before he touched me, I got up screaming and sweating.My parents got into my room and hugged me.‘Are you alright?’, my mom asked.‘I couldn’t move… I couldn’t move…’, was all I could say. The next day, my dad drove me to school.I struggled to get out of the car.I was trembling, looking everywhere around, terrified that I might see the monster in my dreams.My dad saw my tears coming down and sighed.We went back home.My mom asked what happened as she saw us, and dad said that this was not ok, that something was very wrong.I was already drenched in sweat and I hadn’t seen the man once yet that day. We went to the doctor.I knew what kind of doctor it was.A shrink, the one for the crazy people.But I didn’t mind.I was ready to accept I was crazy as long as he freed me from my nightmare.I wasn’t as concerned about the man as I was of the fact that I couldn’t move. I was used to seeing the man, but this was new and it scared me to death.After he heard the story, he simply shot me with the news:Sleep paralysis.What?!But he told me not to worry.

In fact I have no doubt you could sit in front of a screen and do both of those activities for 2 hours, or even longer without breaking your concentration.But what about half an hour of studying? That might be too hard.How about working on your side business for another hour? Doesn't sound too appealing.Even though you logically know that studying, exercising, building a business or something equally productive, will bring you more benefits in the long run, you still prefer watching TV, playing video games and scrolling through social media.One might argue that it's obvious why.One activity is easy and doesn't require much effort, while the other activity is difficult and it requires you to apply yourself.But some people seem to have no problem studying, exercising, or working on their side projects, regularly.Which begs the question: Why are some people more motivated to tackle difficult things?And is there a way to make doing difficult things, easy?References:https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/00...https://www.centersite.net/poc/view_d...",PT14M14S,2020-02-24,2020-02-24,112314,Better Than Yesterday,/channel/UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,UCpExuV8qJMfCaSQNL1YG6bQ,19,9QiE-M1LrZk

In five hundred years, we may look back and say, ""Elon Musk was the single most influential person of our entire century."" He has been able to do more in his 46 years than most of us could hope to do in ten lifetimes and yes, part of that is because Elon is incredibly smart and he works incredibly hard. ...and we're so hot up; we had just one computer so the website was up during the day and I was coding at night. ...work hard like it mean every waking hour; that's the thing I would say if your particular if you're starting a company. But working 100 hours a week still only puts you at two-and-a-half times as much as the average employee. And most geniuses do not make the international impact that Elon has.

Bobby Laughed at Black's First Move | Fischer vs Addison  | Palma de Mallorca Interzonal (1970),Entertainment,1667809,"18,338",617,"The 1970 Interzonal was held in Palma de Mallorca from November 9-December 12, and was the last Interzonal held as a one-section round robin. With the tournament swelling to 24 players and further expansion on the way, future changes were inevitable. The following players vied for six slots in the candidates matches to be held in 1971: William G Addison, Miroslav Filip, Robert James Fischer, Efim Geller, Svetozar Gligoric, Vlastimil Hort, Robert Huebner, Borislav Ivkov, Eleazar Jimenez Zerquera, Bent Larsen, Milan Matulovic, Henrique Mecking, Dragoljub Minic, Renato Naranja, Oscar Panno, Lev Polugaevsky, Lajos Portisch, Samuel Reshevsky, Jorge Alberto Rubinetti, Vasily Smyslov, Duncan Suttles, Mark Taimanov, Wolfgang Uhlmann, Tudev Ujtumen..Ujtumen from Mongolia, about as outside as an outsider could get, actually held the lead by himself after round 3. However, reality and Robert J. Fischer set in, as the American quickly soared to a dominating position. The other contenders didn't worry about it too much; after all, you only had to finish in the top six to qualify for the Candidates, and there was even a seventh spot open for a reserve. So they played it safe, while Fischer kept working hard.At the quarter pole following round 6, Fischer had 5.5 points and a 1.5 point lead on Geller, Gligoric, Larson, Panno, and Ujtumen. But then came a bad stretch: he managed to draw lost positions in round 7 and 8, but Larsen didn't let him off the hook in round 9. By now the lead had vanished, as Geller joined Fischer at the top with 6.5.That led to the critical round 12 encounter between the leaders, Geller holding a half-point lead and playing the White pieces. Any normal grandmaster, when Geller offered an early draw, would have accepted to get an easy half-point closer to qualification. Fischer, hungry for a win after five rounds without one, refused.Geller played inaccurately and lost a pawn, reaching a difficult rook ending. Eventually, a hallucination and a final mistake sealed his fate, and Fischer took the lead. The rest was a matter of technique: Fischer won two more in a row, took a couple of draws for a breather, then started his famous streak with full points in his last seven games.Read more here http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess....Read more about events before 1970 Instrzonal tournament http://graeme.50webs.com/chesschamps/...Robert James Fischer vs William G AddisonPalma de Mallorca Interzonal (1970), Palma de Mallorca ESP, rd 3, Nov-11 Scandinavian Defense: Ilundain Variation (B01)1. e4 d5 2. ed5 Qd5 3.

Why Your Internet Sucks | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix,People & Blogs,1664861,"42,127",913,"On the latest episode of Patriot Act, Hasan discusses Internet inequality in the U.S. and the reasons why millions of Americans cannot get online in 2019. Even though the Internet is considered a basic human right by the UN, many poor and rural communities across the country are still left with little to no access to broadband networks. This lack of Internet access then further impacts the ability of these communities to obtain healthcare, education, and other important necessities. While Internet service providers like Comcast and Charter are largely to blame for Internet inequality in parts of the country, the FCC is making things worse by siding with private corporations at the expense of millions of Americans who lack access to what has become a vital tool for everyday life. Since so many Americans lack access to streaming platforms like Netflix, we decided to put out a DVD version of this episode that can be rented at dvd.com/patriotact.

As you probably know, a wiki is a website which consists of collaborations of people modifying content. The most popular of these sites is none other than Wikipedia. It was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. The former once said, “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.” And they did a good job. You can find 301 languages on Wikipedia, but the English language version is easily the biggest. Right now, in English you can find 5.7 million articles, and 46 million pages, which have been edited 860 million times and looked at by 1,203 admins. It’s not surprising then, that there’s some weird stuff you can find on Wikipedia.

The Syphilis Enigma (Medieval Disease Documentary) | Timeline,Education,3812099,"26,746","3,295","In 1495 a new disease hit Europe. It was deadly, devastating and attacked those who were promiscuous, well-heeled and well-travelled. But what was Syphilis and where had it come from? The traditional view has been that syphilis was part of ""the Columbian exchange"" – one of the things, along with tobacco and the potato, that the New World gave the Old. Arriving in Spain in the 1490s with Columbus and his crew, this destructive new plague spread quickly across Europe, leaving no country, no city, no royal household untouched. But what if this assumption is wrong? There is evidence of syphilis in skeletons dug from sites in France, Italy and England.

Crazy Unexpected Things That Were Found Inside of People,Education,4244635,"49,610","1,778","Nobody expected to find these things inside of people, yet they did! Your body is a temple, but sometimes that temple can have ugly invaders. At other times, people choose to put rather strange things inside their personal shrines. Over the years, doctors around the world have pulled out some pretty horrible things from people's bodies, or they discovered things growing inside of people that are the stuff of nightmares. Hello and welcome to another episode of The Infographics Show. Today, we're taking a look at the most shocking things ever discovered inside people.Before we start, we have to warn you that this episode is not for the squeamish, and if you're currently eating, you may want to click away and come back when done. Just don't say we didn't warn you.First up, we have the story of a six-year-old British girl from just this year who went to the hospital complaining about abdominal pain and continuous vomiting for three to four days. On physical inspection, her stomach was rigid to the touch, and she was clearly dehydrated. When the doctors sent her off for an X-ray, they were shocked to discover a large, dark mass in her bowels that wound up into her intestines. Rushing her to surgery, the doctors pulled a giant hairball weighing 4 pounds (1.8 kg) and measuring 3 feet (1 meter) long. The hairball had settled in her bowels and caused a blockage, while its tail extended all the way up into her intestines. Doctors would go on to diagnose her with trichotillomania or Rapunzel syndrome, a condition where people pull out their own hair and sometimes eat it. The hair tends to accumulate over years and years until it finally causes a blockage that can turn fatal, as was the case for a 16-year-old British girl who died after her hairball became infected.SUBSCRIBE TO US -► http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITE (SUGGEST A TOPIC):http://theinfographicsshow.com SOCIAL:Twitter........► https://twitter.com/TheInfoShowSubreddit...► http://reddit.com/r/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources for this episode:https://pastebin.com/6Kut36yE🎬 GRAPHICS, MUSIC AND TEMPLATES PROVIDED BY ENVATO ELEMENTS - Check them out here http://bit.ly/Elements-InfographicsShow",PT8M55S,2019-01-08,2019-01-08,112535,The Infographics Show,/channel/UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,19,PGWdQuYaNxw

How poor people survive in the USA | DW Documentary,Education,10917834,"121,921","17,127","Homelessness, hunger and shame: poverty is rampant in the richest country in the world. Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s.

He expected everyone here to be very happy. What he saw surprised and shocked him. In this funny, fast-moving, and deeply insightful talk, Dr. Sood shares his journey over two decades and across two continents, finding a way to help us outsmart our neural predispositions to suffering. In the process, he takes us on a back-stage tour of the human brain and outlines the gist of a structured program he is taking globally to decrease stress and improve focus, resilience, and happiness.Amit Sood, MD, is Professor of Medicine at Mayo Clinic and Director of Mayo's Complementary and Integrative Medicine program. He is the author of The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living and The Mayo Clinic Guide to Happiness. He is one of the most sought-after speakers at Mayo. He has received several NIH and foundation awards to test and implement integrative and mind-body approaches within medicine. Dr. Sood received the 2010 Distinguished Service Award, the 2010 Innovator of the Year Award, and the 2013 Outstanding Physician Award from Mayo Clinic.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Why do I ride bicycles while all others are driving? | Jacob Klink | TEDxHejiangting,Nonprofits & Activism,239045,"2,634",119,"Motor industry made a huge fortune while offering convenience to people and aimed to shorten the distance from point A to B. But Jacob raised the question again, does driving really help us to get from point A to B any faster? Living in city center, Jacob had his bike shop in Chengdu, and inspires people to ride and share with us how riding bikes help us to be more healthy, more community-friendly, and do more good to our environment.Jacob Klink moved several times throughout the course of his childhood. From the historical regions surrounding Philadelphia to the country's heartland, his family eventually settled in the high desert city of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  It was here he attended the University of New Mexico and earned a bachelor's in history.  While in school he discovered two areas which would transform his labors and passions moving forward in life.  The first was bicycling.  Outside of class, Jacob's free time was spent exploring his world by bicycle and organizing events to engage with the community and promote cycling.  The second was an interest in China.  With the flexibility learned from his childhood of moving from place to place, it was an easy choice upon graduation to move to China to learn firsthand it's history, its language and its culture.

Learn 📝 How to Find Winning 🏅 Combinations With This Technique! - GM Susan Polgar,People & Blogs,45895,562,22,"♕ FULL COURSE: https://www.ichess.net/shop/polgar-ch...♕ 10 GM SECRETS: https://www.ichess.net/10gmsecrets/♕ MORE: https://www.ichess.net/2016/08/02/fin...In this video, GM Susan Polgar reveals the building blocks of tactical patterns and shows how to find winning combinations.Finding tactics during games is often more difficult than finding them during puzzles as we don’t always know there’s a tactic to be found. However, there are certain ‘clues’ in chess positions, which can point towards possible tactics.One of these is the presence of an unprotected piece. GM John Nunn coined the phrase “loose pieces drop off” (often referred to as LPDO) to remind players that an unprotected/loose piece is a serious weakness. There are many situations where we can combine threats to take advantage of loose pieces.Another theme in this video (which is a preview of Susan Polgar’s 15 hour Secrets of Chess Tactics for Beginners) is the importance of considering our opponent’s strongest response. Many moves appear tempting because they make a major threat and some, obvious responses lose. However, we must presume our opponent will play well and find the best reply, otherwise we’re playing what Dan Heisman calls “hope chess”.Susan shows how to put ourselves in our opponent’s position to find possible counter-attacks. If we find one, we must reject our move. However, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t still a winning move available. Often strong positions have many  possibilities. Some work, some don’t. By finding counters for our opponent, we can narrow down our list of moves to choose from.Then Susan reveals another move-finding technique: the what-if method. This involves looking at the position and asking “what if…” to see if it prompts any ideas. For instance, you might see that you could win material with a discovered check if you could move a pawn forward – but the pawn is currently blocked by an enemy pawn. So you think “what if that pawn wasn’t there?” and find ways to either win material or force it to move (capture a piece it was defending).This video will help you find tactical patterns (like forks, pins and skewers) in more complicated game situations.Enjoy the video and remember to check out the complete course here.",PT27M19S,2016-08-02,2016-08-02,222411,iChess Channel 2,/channel/UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,UCSMNmUU9x6_UzRDPDGvC7IA,19,IQGOGW1Mdvg

Better brain health | DW Documentary,Education,2171404,"18,516",586,"Chocolate reduces stress. Fish stimulates the brain. Is there any truth to such popular beliefs? The findings of researchers around the world say yes: It appears we really are what we eat.A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of Lübeck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called ""brain food"" for example: The Mediterranean diet that’s based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

"Michael Moore on Trump, 2020 & Why “the Old, Angry White Guy” Doesn’t Represent the Working Class",News & Politics,541130,"9,049",688,"Last week on Democracy Now!, acclaimed filmmaker Michael Moore predicted Donald Trump would win-re-election if Democrats don’t choose a candidate to run against him who excites their base of voters. His comments prompted President Donald Trump to respond on Twitter, “He made [the] same prediction in 2016. Nobody ever said Michael was stupid!” But Moore’s comments went further than Trump’s tweet alluded to. He said the working class in the United States is mostly women, people of color and young people — all groups who tend to vote Democratic. Moore, who supports Bernie Sanders, said Democrats can win if they focus on these voters and on bold proposals like Medicare for All.#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Why renewables can’t save the planet | Michael Shellenberger | TEDxDanubia,Nonprofits & Activism,1811451,"44,827","5,588","Environmentalists have long promoted renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind farms to save the climate.

Michael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine Hero of the Environment and President of Environmental Progress, a research and policy organization. A lifelong environmentalist, Michael changed his mind about nuclear energy and has helped save enough nuclear reactors to prevent an increase in carbon emissions equivalent to adding more than 10 million cars to the road.

Why can't we just print money to pay off debt?,Education,3230204,"46,323","2,153","A video looking at way you can't simply print money to pay off debt. And what has happened when countries have tried to! And for that matter why a country having debt isn't necessarily a bad thing. The only reason the US has the most debt is because the US dollar is considered the most trust-worthy currency and other countries see the US as a safe place to put their money. It would be worse it countries started buying debt of other countries and stopped putting into the United States. The debt may be a lot but it's actually not something that's an issue. The US will never 'pay-off' its debt because that's not how it works. National debt only becomes an issue if GDP isn't growing, which it is. A more accurate way to see when the debt is an issue is the debt-GDP ration. In which the US is fine in that respect. Whereas Greece and Japan have debt-GDP ratios of over 150%, which is bad. Also, keep in mind that the US owns debt of many other countries. In fact, for every $1 of US debt, the US holds $0.89 of foreign debt.

The Science of Love | John Gottman | TEDxVeniceBeach,Nonprofits & Activism,474419,"5,640",222,"World-renowned relationship expert John Gottman set forth to understand why relationships don’t work, but for that he needed to first understand relationships scientifically. Gottman then measured the behavior, perception and physiology of couples over time to understand how love works. With that he was able to create equations for love and discern the mathematical dynamics of love. His science was able to predict with a 90% accuracy whether relationships would last or not. Finally, his studies conclude that the magic of love requires calm and commitment, which in the end makes the magic of great love a bit less of a mystery. John Gottman speaks about how his scientific research has now created a new understanding of all love relationships (heterosexual and same-sex), across the entire life span. He describes the new LOVE EQUATIONS, and the magic trio of calm, trust, and commitment. For more, visit The Gottman Institute at https://www.gottman.com/.  World-renowned for his work on marital stability and divorce prediction, Dr. John Gottman has conducted 40 years of breakthrough research with thousands of couples. He is the author of over 200 published academic articles and author or co-author of more than 40 books, including The New York Times bestseller The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. Dr. Gottman’s media appearances include Good Morning America, Today, CBS Morning News, and Oprah, as well articles in The New York Times, Redbook, Glamour, Woman’s Day, People, Self, and Psychology Today. Co-founder of The Gottman Institute with his wife, Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, John is a Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Washington where he founded ”The Love Lab"" at which much of his research on couples interactions was conducted.

Live blitz and rapid chess.Rapid chess and blitz chess tournamentsBlitz chess (also known as speed or fast chess) is a type of chess in which each player is given less time to consider their moves than normal tournament time controls allow. Openings, tactics and strategy are same.The Sicilian Defense is the most popular defense against white’s opening 1.e4 and is used extensively at top level play. It is a very aggressive defense and immediately stakes claim at the center, denying white the double pawns on e4 and d4. Many chess champions actually prefer to start with 1.d4 because of how well the Sicilian Defense plays against 1.e4.Eventually the c-pawn of black is usually exchanged, opening the semi-open c file for black to bring his queen or rook to and add pressure to the queen side attack.White not only has to worry about black’s defense but also the counter attack that the Sicilian Defense presents. White tends to have the advantage on the king side while black will usually look to attack on the queen side.For those chess players that play against the 1.e4 opening quite often, the Sicilian Defense is an opening that you should spend quite a bit of time studying. There are many variations and they each are designed for specific types of players.#siciliandefense #gadirguseinov #siciliandragon",PT27M21S,2020-02-14,2020-02-14,22135,Rapid chess,/channel/UCZ5MqmhUls6vg_XTNf2IAmQ,UCZ5MqmhUls6vg_XTNf2IAmQ,19,APJ5E1wXB3g

How to Checkmate with Bishop and Knight,Education,1264352,"20,070",640,"This video demonstrates how to checkmate with the bishop and knight. After some experimentation with solving the bishop and knight checkmate, I found that the first step of simply centralizing ones pieces on the four center squares, with the knight on the same color square as the bishop, is an efficient coordination of the pieces. The knight from such a position is then very quick to becoming optimized in what follows of the Deletang's Triangles, where the king is forced into a large triangle, a medium triangle, and then a small triangle. Once the king is in the small triangle and restricted to exactly two squares, we give checkmate. Practice makes perfect! ★ FACEBOOK http://facebook.com/ChessNetwork★ TWITTER http://twitter.com/ChessNetwork★ GOOGLE+ http://google.com/+ChessNetwork★ LIVESTREAM http://twitch.tv/ChessNetworkInternet Chess Club (ICC)http://chessclub.com",PT14M10S,2013-07-26,2013-07-26,225123,ChessNetwork,/channel/UCCDOQrpqLqKVcTCKzqarxLg,UCCDOQrpqLqKVcTCKzqarxLg,20,r3EqM17jvOc

10 INCREDIBLE Space Launch Failures! [4K],Science & Technology,15161599,"93,950","8,433","Space launch is the earliest part of a flight that reaches space. Space launch involves liftoff, when a rocket or other space launch vehicle leaves the ground, floating ship or midair aircraft at the start of a flight. Liftoff is of two main types: rocket launch (the current conventional method), and non-rocket spacelaunch (where other forms of propulsion are employed, including airbreathing jet engines or other kinds).Rocket launch is the only current way to reach space. In some cases an airbreathing (jet engine) first stage has been used as well.Non-rocket space launch is a launch into space where some or all of the needed speed and altitude are provided by something other than expendable rockets. A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed. In some systems such as Skyhooks, rocket sled launch, and air launch, a rocket is used to reach orbit, but it is only part of the system.Launches in this video:10) Nasa Antares9) Atlas rocket8) Ariane 57) Juno II6) Atlas5)  Titan I4)  Spacex Falcon 93) Atlas Centaur2) Atlas Centaur 51) Proton MLike this video and subscribe to my channel for more content like this.Sources:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpId8...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCWun...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK_yg...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UYnI...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6wX...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61A6c...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqW0L...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuNym...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AHYJ...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDPo9...Spacial credits to NASA and SpaceXLicensing:Video segments used are either not copyrighted, free for public use or transformative to fall under fair use.https://www.spacex.com/trademarks-cop...https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guide...",PT10M43S,2018-04-12,2018-04-12,14215,Dark Space,/channel/UC5F3xHBvp_4WPLmSU-cQZMg,UC5F3xHBvp_4WPLmSU-cQZMg,20,WFZwI10HEsw

Great Leaders Do What Drug Addicts Do | Michael Brody-Waite | TEDxNashville,Nonprofits & Activism,1529079,"50,188","1,015","This is my story from drug addiction and homelessness to founding and leading a company on the Inc 500 list. There are 3 principles that saved me from death and set me apart as a leader. They are small enough to fit in your pocket, yet big enough to change your life. The best part is that anyone can take these principles and immediately implement them after watching this talk.  Connect with Michael at ww.michaelbrodywaite.com In 2010, Michael left a Fortune 50 company at the height of the recession to co-found and lead InQuicker, a healthcare SaaS company that allows patients to self-schedule appointments. His leadership grew the organization from 2 employees to 50 employees and 20,000% revenue growth in less than 6 years. This exceptional growth landed InQuicker a spot on the Inc. 500 list of Fastest Growing Private Companies. Additionally, InQuicker was named “Best Place To Work” by the Nashville Business Journal 4 times and recognized by the Nashville Chamber of Commerce as Healthcare company of the year. Brody-Waite’s accomplishments include being named Most Admired CEO, Top 40 under 40 by the Nashville Business Journal and recognized by the Nashville Chamber of Commerce as Healthcare Entrepreneur of the Year. Today, Michael is CEO of the Nashville Entrepreneur Center (EC) and Founder of Leader Confidential (LC).

Hard drives only last five years, a web page is forever changing and there’s no machine left that reads 15-year old floppy disks. Digital data is vulnerable.

I like to have a laugh and my videos are quite fast paced BUT you will learn a lot, I assure you.Lets go make a mess._________________________________________________________________INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/mattestleaf...PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/mattestleaMUSIC BY EPIDEMIC SOUND: http://www.epidemicsound.com/MATT ESTLEA WOODWORK 2017",PT39M39S,2017-11-23,2017-11-23,251441,Matt Estlea,/channel/UCxWzA3ZlYEOLr1JkKH0ZMyg,UCxWzA3ZlYEOLr1JkKH0ZMyg,19,2hP-QAAhpxQ

Beginner Rafter Layout | Speed Square | Common Rafter,Education,410233,"6,801",171,"Today we are tackling a big beginner lesson, which is common rafter layout and cutting.

"Cars Almost Killed Our Cities, But Here's How We Can Bring Them Back | Gabe Klein | TEDxMidAtlantic",Nonprofits & Activism,44009,899,35,"Our cities are making us – and the planet – sick, and the problem lies in the automobile, which has taken over how we live and use space. Thankfully, new technology like autonomous vehicles and 3D printing has opened the door for us to bring our cities back from the brink, says transportation expert and city planner Gabe Klein. But we need to act quickly to ensure cities will be places we want to live.Gabe is the former Commissioner of the Chicago and Washington DC Departments of Transportation. In both cities he revamped technology platforms and government processes while focusing on putting people first vs. automobiles on city streets. This included launching two of the first and largest bikeshare systems in the U.S. and building protected bike lanes and better pedestrian infrastructure for vulnerable citizens citywide, as well as facilitating private services like carshare and rideshare that could help each cities mobility goals.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

What if There's Nothing Wrong With You | Susan Henkels | TEDxSedona,Nonprofits & Activism,439278,"12,959",250,"We often design our lives around a long list of all the things we believe are wrong with us.  The premise of this presentation questions our interpretation of right and wrong and how that interpretation ultimately determines how we decide who we will become as adults, how we choose our important relationships, how we pick our professions, how or if we parent, and what determines the quality of the life we choose.  This presentation is a discovery toward what's in the way of having the life you deserve and an easier and more fun way of getting there.  You will find ways of releasing judgment and criticism of yourself, begin to consider forgiveness of yourself and others, start making wiser choices, and expand your passion for contribution.  Asking the question:  What if there's nothing wrong with you?....... can become an ongoing practice for life."" usan Munich Henkels.

Canada is Quietly Building The Trading Empire Of The World,Education,1002641,"22,135","2,348","We live in a world where globalization and trade have become one of the most vital aspects in determining the power of a country’s economy. In fact, the process of getting goods from point A to point B might be one of the most important economic drivers in the world, yet no one talks about it. And somehow…quietly in the background,  We might be seeing the creation of the most powerful trading economy in the world…but not for the reasons that you might think.If you want to ship an item from a manufacturing hub like China, to a consumer hub in a Place like New York…how would you do it?Well you could just send the package on a direct flight and it’ll get their in roughly 15 hours. But this is extremely costly. It actually costs anywhere from 5 to 15 times more to ship by air than to ship by the most common shipping method… by sea.So, we are probably going to need to use a sea freighter. Now how would you deliver the package? Well you could drop the package off at long beach, and use a rail or truck to move the item to new york, but again, that is usually more costly.Now we are in a predicament. In order to get an Item from China, all the way to new york, a ship would need cross the pacific ocean, travel all the way around the bottom of south america, make its way through the atlantic ocean, before reaching its destination after travelling 30,000 kilometres.And this is a problem that was faced for hundreds of years. For example, when countries like Great Britain wanted to trade with the west coast of the united states or south america. Virtually all ships would’ve needed to travel around the bottom of south america in order to deliver their goods. That was until the early 1900’s when the United States decided to buy up an 82 kilometre long plot of land in Panama. You see, the united states saw that this was the smallest amount of land that separated the Atlantic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean. So they thought this land could be used for both trade and military purposes. So, they purchased this plot for roughly $40 million dollars, or roughly $916 million dollars today.They then created an artificial lake, and dug trenches from this new artificial lake(gatun lake) to both the pacific and atlantic oceans. And finally on August 15th, 1914, the Panama Canal was opened. And the first american ship to ever travel directly from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean, without going around south america, had passed through the Canal. It was a cargo ship called SS Ancon, and was largely responsible for shipping cement from New York, to Panama in order to help build the Canal’s infrastructure. And this opening of the Panama Canal would go on to change the world in many ways. For example, in 2019 nearly 1 million ships passed through this Canal, which indirectly resulted in trillions of dollars worth of commerce. The Canal also generated roughly 2.6 Billion dollars worth of fees for granting access of use of the Canal, so the Canal itself is a pretty decent money maker itself as well.But this Canal also has limits, for example, no ships longer than 1200ft or wider than 168ft can actually pass through the Canal, as the waterway is simply not large enough to allow bigger ships through. So that is why today, you see most cargo ships being built with the exact dimensions needed to fit in the Panama Canal.Another more unforeseen effect that this Canal had was that it wreaked havoc on some south American countries like Chile. This was because the ships that once had to stop at multiple port cities along the Chilean coast, all of a sudden stopped coming by. This was a large contributing factor to an economic collapse in Chile, which saw its state income and international trade cut in half within 2 years.Way too long.

Tal won the 1958 interzonal tournament at Portoroz, then helped the Soviet Union to retain the Chess Olympiad; before going on to win the 1959 Candidates Tournament with 20 out of 28 points--a point and a half ahead of second place Paul Keres.Tal often sacrificed material in search for the initiative in chess.

Mystery Of The Cocaine Mummies (Ancient Egypt Documentary) | Timeline,Education,4059304,"26,255","2,333","Equinox brings us this investigation of a mystery that is baffling Egyptologists. The case calls into question whole areas of accepted scientific fact from botany, through chemistry to archaeology. In 1992, routine tests on a mummy in a Munich museum revealed high body levels of cocaine and nicotine. But such substances were not available in ancient Egypt, coming as they do from the Americas – not, apparently, to be “discovered” for thousands of years after the passing of the Egyptian dynasties. Are the mummies fakes; were the substances from plants that have since disappeared or were there, in fact, trade routes between Egypt and South America that predate accepted chronology?Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",PT14M49S,2019-09-19,2019-09-19,141542,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,19,1VPfZ_XzisU

"21 Forever Foods. . . and a few we wish would, too!",People & Blogs,881674,"23,091",795,"Christa Swartz of Prepsteaders.com shows at least 21 Foods that can last up to a century without spoiling. If you have wondered what to stock your pantry with, this is a great place to start!  Prepsteading starts with simple steps like learning about and storing up a bit of food that can last without requiring refrigeration or extensive preservation techniques.  Let us know what to add to this list if you are familiar with other foods that last forever.* The ONLY reason I mentioned pop tops is NOT because they will last, but simply because if I buy commercially canned goods at the store, I try to get them with ""pop-tops"" to use within  a reasonable time. Their is no expectation of them lasting. (They are just great for quick meals on the run or in an emergency.)* Top Ramen is NOT recommended. It is on the ""a few we wish would, too!"" list, but is NOT a forever food.* Since so many have asked: There seem to be a million differing opinions out there on Peanut Butter.  It should be packaged in a sealed glass jar with a metal lid and stored in a cool, dark, dry storage area.  There are a good number of stories of Peanut Butter lasting 30+ years without going rancid under these conditions. I hope that helps.

World War 3 Doomsday Airplane: E-6 Mercury,Education,1500236,"38,778","1,965","The date is Christmas Eve, 2019, and deep in the heart of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, technicians working at the North American Aerospace Defense Command- otherwise known as NORAD- track the flight of a Russian rocket launch. In accordance with international regulations, the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, formally announced the launch weeks before, and filed a flight path with the UN.The launch is a curious one, as the launch trajectory doesn't follow the typical equatorial or polar orbital trajectories of most spacecraft. The Russians claim that the rocket contains a probe which will use the highly eccentric orbit to rendezvous with a medium-sized asteroid flying past the earth a few million miles away, itself on a highly eccentric orbit. The math checks out, and thus as NORAD tracks the launch entering space above the US, there is no reason for alarm.Nonetheless, American space and ground-based imaging assets still track the curious Russian probe. The rocket seems to be smaller than anticipated for the launching of a deep space probe, but the Russians claim that their probe is powered by an ion engine, which doesn't require much fuel. Some inside of the American aerospace and defense sector are suspicious that the launch is actually a new secret Russian military satellite, and thus NORAD is ordered to track its trajectory carefully and detect if any sub-vehicles are released from the main body of the spacecraft as it reaches orbit.Check out my new channel I Am: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH5Y...🔔 SUBSCRIBE TO THE INFOGRAPHICS SHOW ► https://www.youtube.com/c/theinfograp...🔖 MY SOCIAL PAGESDISCORD ►https://discord.gg/theinfographicsshowFacebook ► https://www.facebook.com/TheInfograph...Twitter ► https://twitter.com/TheInfoShow💭  SUGGEST A TOPIChttps://www.theinfographicsshow.com📝 SOURCES:https://pastebin.com/htrmMb66All videos are based on publicly available information unless otherwise noted.",PT11M17S,2019-12-26,2019-12-26,11134,The Infographics Show,/channel/UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,20,xY5vxLsO_Dc

FBI EXPOSED: Lindsey Graham DETAILS Massive FBI Bias Against President Trump,News & Politics,569112,"14,789",563,"The U.S. attorney who is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of the origins of the Trump-Russia probe released a rare statement Monday saying he disagrees with conclusions of the so-called FISA report -- after DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz found in that review that the probe's launch largely complied with DOJ and FBI policies.“Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened,” U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a statement.Horowitz released his report Monday saying his investigators found no intentional misconduct or political bias surrounding efforts to launch that 2016 probe and to seek a highly controversial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in the early months of the investigation. Still, it found that there were ""significant concerns with how certain aspects of the investigation were conducted and supervised.""“I have the utmost respect for the mission of the Office of Inspector General and the comprehensive work that went into the report prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff,” Durham said. “However, our investigation is not limited to developing information from within component parts of the Justice Department. Our investigation has included developing information from other persons and entities, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.”As Horowitz has conducted his review of DOJ actions during the Russia probe, Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, has also been conducting a wider inquiry into alleged misconduct and alleged improper government surveillance on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.Fox News reported in October that Durham's ongoing probe has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation.Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr ripped the FBI’s “intrusive” investigation after the release of Horowitz’s review, saying it was launched based on the “thinnest of suspicions.”“The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,” Barr said in a statement.Barr expressed frustration that the FBI continued investigating the Trump campaign, even as “exculpatory” information came to the light.",PT42M20S,2019-12-11,2019-12-11,211151,FOX 10 Phoenix,/channel/UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,20,6yaPqs1u9nE

"How ""normal people"" can train like the worlds best endurance athletes | Stephen Seiler | TEDxArendal",Nonprofits & Activism,461418,"8,769",216,"In this talk, Dr Seiler explains in words and pictures how modern exercise physiology laboratories reveal the body’s remarkable capacity for adaptation.  He also tells us about the “laboratories” developed by athletes and coaches since the start of the Cold War in the 1950s.  The laboratory of the scientist and the laboratory of the coach/athlete come together as Dr. Seiler describes his own journeys back and forth between them.  By connecting the power of both, we have learned why “no pain no gain” is a slick slogan, but a fundamentally flawed approach to getting faster and fitter over time.   Stephen Seiler has spent years studying the training habits of great endurance athletes. What he discovered has shattered the myths he grew up with in the US. Let him tell you why going “green” is also important for building endurance sustainably.

The Genesis of the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic,Education,298499,,,"Michael Worobey, Professor, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, The University of ArizonaThe Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 was the most intense outbreak of disease in human history. It killed upwards of 50 million people (most in a six-week period) casting a long shadow of fear and mystery: nearly a century later, scientists have been unable to explain why, unlike all other influenza outbreaks, it killed young adults in huge numbers. I will describe how analyses of large numbers of influenza virus genomes are revealing the pathway traveled by the genes of this virus before it exploded in 1918. What emerges is a surprising tale with many players and plot lines, in which echoes of prior pandemics, imprinted in the immune responses of those alive in 1918, set the stage for the catastrophe. I will also discuss how resolving the mysteries of 1918 could help to prevent future pandemics and to control seasonal influenza, which quietly kills millions more every decade.",PT68M9S,2014-05-01,2014-05-01,232143,The University of Arizona,/channel/UCxtFtv498asEMr883r3o-Dg,UCxtFtv498asEMr883r3o-Dg,20,48Klc3DPdtk

Emotional laws are the answer for better relationships: Diana Wais at TEDxThessaloniki,Nonprofits & Activism,1024285,"18,280",680,"Nuclear physics, astronomy and molecular biology truly lack complexity when they are juxtaposed to one word: relationships. Interpersonal relationships represent probably one of the most complicated ideas that have troubled the human mind.Whether it's aristocracy, models, professional athletes or every day couples they all face the same difficulty of making their relationships work. Diana Wais talked about how ""we are all the same"" and how we respond with criticism when we feel threatened by words. However, it is important to ""respond to the other person's need with empathy"", she said. It is difficult to understand when you are being emotional and when irrational. Her most valid point though was that, as individuals, we need to conquer the unconscious emotions and understand that essentially, we are all fighting the same internal fight.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",PT17M58S,2014-06-20,2014-06-20,132144,TEDx Talks,/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,19,gTZgfyOW-DA

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

Today’s case—U.S. Patent and Trademark Office v. Booking.com—could upend how trademarks work in the internet age. The U.S. patent office has refused to let Booking.com trademark its company name, arguing that brands can't protect a generic term like 'hotels' by combining it with a generic internet domain like '.com.' Booking.com argues that consumers aren't confused and know it's a specific brand.

A classic story like that about an athlete guy and a cheerleader girl, yes.We were doomed to date, at least until our graduation. Usually such couples do not live after - the cheerleaders marry quiet nerds with money, and the athletes merge after college and become ordinary workers with a beer belly and a stretched T-shirt. But at the school-time it’s just an obligation - the king and queen of high school, the first dance at graduation, the envy in the eyes of the friends ...To everyone’s surprise, we didn’t  break up right after school. Lucas really decided not to break stereotypes and went to college - he was given a sports scholarship, and studying in that college did not bother much. But instead of a sudden wedding, I entered the university. We then quarreled for the first time, because it seemed to Lucas that campus was all about a mess and debauchery only.",PT11M10S,2020-05-03,2020-05-03,112445,Teen life,/channel/UC5zkAo3xIVV5yoJrhOY_I3g,UC5zkAo3xIVV5yoJrhOY_I3g,19,fA7mA_XX90s

Eat for real change | Dr Joanna McMillan | TEDxMacquarieUniversity,Nonprofits & Activism,852455,"9,125",482,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Most of us know we should eat better, but we don’t do it. We are increasingly confused over nutrition with so many conflicting views, and we give scarce thought as to how we eat or our relationship with food. We can only bring about real change when we end this confusion and bring the joy back to food.Adopted by the nation as an honorary Aussie, Dr Joanna McMillan’s ever-growing following is the result of her high profile within the media, health and fitness industries, and through her roles as Vice President of the Australian Lifestyle Medicine Association (ALMA), Ambassador for Diabetes Australia, and Ambassador for Australian Pineapples (to name a few).As a teenager Dr Joanna discovered that the way she ate and how much she exercised significantly impacted on her energy levels, mood, self-esteem, appearance and, consequently, her outlook on life.  She initially studied psychology but her love of exercise resulted in a 15-year career as a fitness instructor.Having completed a Bachelor Degree in Science with First Class Honours in Nutrition and Dietetics, Dr Joanna moved to Australia and won a scholarship to complete her PhD with The University of Sydney in 1999.Today, Dr Joanna is the founder of Get Lean, a regular on the Nine Network and the official nutritionist for TODAY. She is also the author of several books, has a weekly column in Sunday Life and a blogger for Woolworths Baby & Toddler Club.Dr Joanna is a busy working mother, a tautology that provides her with an unwavering drive to teach people how to live a healthy and nutrition-filled life – yet one that doesn’t require obsessive or unrealistic attention in order to achieve it.The philosophy of this down-to-earth Scot is simple. She believes that having a good healthy relationship with food is just as important as eating nutritious foods, and she regards food as more than the nutrients it contains; rather, it is part of our social connection, our culture and a great source of pleasure in life.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",PT17M41S,2014-10-20,2014-10-20,131144,TEDx Talks,/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,19,fbeFn1Xcqo4

Ke3 Qf4Bobby Fischer was a record-setting chess master who became the youngest player to win the U.S. Chess Championship at 14, and the first American-born player to win the World Chess Championship.Bobby Fischer was born on March 9, 1943, in Chicago, Illinois. Fischer first learned the game of chess at age 6 and eventually became the youngest international grand master at the age of 15. In 1972, he became the first American-born world chess champion after defeating Boris Spassky. An eccentric genius, who was believed to have an I.Q. of 181, Fischer became known for his controversial public remarks in his later years. He was granted Icelandic citizenship in 2005, following legal trouble with the United States. He died on January 17, 2008.Early LifeRobert James Fischer was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 9, 1943. Fischer's parents divorced when he was a toddler, and he began learning chess at the age of 6 after his older sister Joan bought him a chess set. He continued to hone his skills as a youngster at the Brooklyn Chess Club and Manhattan Chess Club. Fischer had a strained relationship with his mother, who supported his chess endeavors, but preferred that he pursue other areas of interest.A brilliant, highly competitive player who lost himself in the game, Fischer earned a place in the record books at age 14 when he became the youngest player to win the U.S. Chess Championship. Then in 1958, at 15, he became the youngest international grand master in history by winning the related tournament in Portoroz, Yugoslavia (now Slovenia). Match of the CenturyDuring the early 1960s, Fischer continued to be involved in U.S. and world championship matches, but was also making a name for himself with his erratic, paranoid commentary. After having a 20-game winning streak in the early 1970s, Fischer once again made chess history in 1972 with his defeat of the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky at the Reykjavik, Iceland world championships, thus marking the first time an American chess player had won the title. Fischer's defeat of a Soviet opponent, which became known as the ""Match of the Century,"" took on iconic proportions in the midst of the Cold War and was seen as a symbolic victory of democracy over Communism. Fischer's historic win also made chess a popular game in the United States. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you realllly enjoy my content, you're welcome to support me and my channel with a small donation via PayPal or Bitcoin.Link to PayPal donation https://www.paypal.me/agadmatorBitcoin adress 12VEbMQPyLzBoZzw9yuNofph4C9Ansc4iZCheck out ALL my videos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZOw...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/agadmatoryou...Twitter: https://twitter.com/agadmatorInstagram: agadmator (new)Lichess: agadmatorChess.com: agadmatorSkype: agadmatorLeague of Legends: agadmator :)Hearthstone: agadmator",PT12M10S,2017-11-10,2017-11-10,223312,agadmator's Chess Channel,/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA,20,jAwSBrLk3Uw

Michael Moore Presents: Planet of the Humans | Full Documentary | Directed by Jeff Gibbs,News & Politics,6097442,,,"Michael Moore presents Planet of the Humans, a documentary that dares to say what no one else will this Earth Day — that we are losing the battle to stop climate change on planet earth because we are following leaders who have taken us down the wrong road — selling out the green movement to wealthy interests and corporate America. This film is the wake-up call to the reality we are afraid to face: that in the midst of a human-caused extinction event, the environmental movement’s answer is to push for techno-fixes and band-aids. It's too little, too late.

Why is this not THE issue? Because that would be bad for profits, bad for business. Have we environmentalists fallen for illusions, “green” illusions, that are anything but green, because we’re scared that this is the end—and we’ve pinned all our hopes on biomass, wind turbines, and electric cars? No amount of batteries are going to save us, warns director Jeff Gibbs (lifelong environmentalist and co-producer of “Fahrenheit 9/11” and “Bowling for Columbine""). This urgent, must-see movie, a full-frontal assault on our sacred cows, is guaranteed to generate anger, debate, and, hopefully, a willingness to see our survival in a new way—before it’s too late.Featuring: Al Gore, Bill McKibben, Richard Branson, Robert F Kennedy Jr., Michael Bloomberg, Van Jones, Vinod Khosla, Koch Brothers, Vandana Shiva, General Motors, 350.org, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Nature Conservancy, Elon Musk, Tesla.Website: https://planetofthehumans.com/",PT100M2S,2020-04-21,2020-04-21,234533,Michael Moore,/channel/UCU_nlLzlVPFLJxB_iEwtwBw,UCU_nlLzlVPFLJxB_iEwtwBw,20,Zk11vI-7czE
