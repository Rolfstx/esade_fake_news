All music made specifically for this video by Producer Tom Fox. https://www.johnnyharris.tv/music At that link you can buy his music for your own videos if you want.This video explores how I organize pictures. You probably have more pictures than you know what to do with. Phones are amazing for taking lots of shots but often the result is too many photos. I have been thinking about how to organize photos for a really long time and this is my workflow to best remember your life by using photos. It uses cloud based storage between my phone and computer to help me see my photos often and it also uses some guiding concepts that help me delete more photos and better enjoy the ones I keep around. I hope this helps at least one person better remember their lives.

"207","New York","Surgeon's Tips: Stop Fogging & Improve Seal on Medical Face Masks #ORTips","Science & Technology",227025,"3,735","130","Surgeon's Tips: Stop Fogging & Improve Seal on Surgical/Medical Face MasksHow to video for Medical Students, Nursing Students, and people in general who want to wear medical face masks more like the Healthcare Professionals to minimize fogging, and improve the seal around the mask.  Why is this important? The surgeon, assisting residents, medical students, nurses, scrub techs cannot touch their face mask face or head covering once they ‚Äúscrubbed in‚Äù for surgery.  When operating or assisting in an operation, you will be ‚Äúscrubbed in‚Äù AKA wearing **sterile** PPE (personal protective equipment: surgical gown, gloves. Your head covering, eye protection and face mask is not considered sterile, so you cannot reach up to your face or head. This will break the ‚Äústerile field‚Äù and you will need to remove the glove that touched your mask.  This is considered bad form and the surgeon or scrub nurse will think you are not experienced.  Ideally you can maximize the fit and comfort of the surgical face mask before entering surgery, to avoid fogging of your eye protection later on during the surgery.  Vision is critical. If the surgeon says to retest here or clamp there, but you can‚Äôt see through the fog or condensation you may make a mistake.  How does this translate to regular people wearing masks during the pandemic?  Once you leave your ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù (your home or car) and enter a store or public building or room, you should not be touching your head, face or mask, similar to surgery.  So making sure that you are wearing face mask like you are about to help with an operation should minimize any need to touch the mask, until you have returned home or back into your car.  Weaknesses of this video.1. I didn‚Äôt discuss how to carefully remove a medical face mask (already many videos explaining it.)2. Medical face masks and CLOTH DIY face masks are DIFFERENT and this may not work for Cloth face masks because the cloth is not fluid resistant and the humidity go through the cloth and still fog the glasses. 3. When wearing a surgical face mask in the operating room, the temperature does not change.  Condensation of water on cold metal/glass/plastic**Some fogging can occur when your glasses get cold from being outside, then when you enter a warmer room the cold glasses will fog up from any humidity in the air and any humidity from the mask. This is similar to why a cold drink gets wet on the outside of the can or glass.  Simple Hack***This video does not address how to keep your glasses warm.  A simple trick is to have a second pair of glasses kept at body temperature inside your coat or jacket. When you go indoors you can remove the cold glasses and wear the warm one. Put the cold glasses against your body to warm it up and it won‚Äôt fog up once it is warm.","PT7M17S","2020-05-01","2020-05-01",222213,"/results?search_query=New+York&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKT3dnXzA2VlB3b2tSWXY1MzRRYVBDOGc%253D","UCVL-2VMrOIojHY8OaU1leaA",20,"mP33EaAEEL0",NA,NA

What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)¬†and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)¬†caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. ¬†Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.¬†It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO, 2020). Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the origin and zoonosis of COVID-19, the routes of transmission, epidemiology (current as of 3/15/2020), pathophysiology, and diagnostic tests used to identify COVID-19.

This is our April update on our previous lecture to keep all of our viewers informed on the new research and publications that have been released on COVID-19. Please be aware‚Äî This lecture is up to date as of April 17, 2020. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. ¬†In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.World Health Organization (WHO) | 8 April 2020REFERENCES | We have a complete list of our references in AMA format on our Facebook & Instagram!Support us by purchasing apparel and donating to our PayPal or Patreon! üòÑ--Become a Patron of ours and receive the final, high resolution photo of the lecture!FUNDINGGoFundMe | https://www.gofundme.com/ninja-nerd-s...APPAREL |Amazon Prime Free Delivery | https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Nerd-Sci...Teespring | teespring.com/stores/ninja-nerd PATREON | https://www.patreon.com/NinjaNerdScienceSOCIAL MEDIAFACEBOOK | https://www.facebook.com/NinjaNerdSci...INSTAGRAM | https://www.instagram.com/ninjanerdsc...ALSO, check out our Medical channel | Ninja Nerd Medicine!https://www.youtube.com/ninjanerdmedi...","PT47M28S","2020-04-20","2020-04-20",222221,"/channel/UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ","UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ",20,"YRfwZcLeOm4",NA,NA

In 2006, Bill Burr walked onto a stage in Philadelphia in front of an audience that had booed and jeered every comedian who had come up before him, and they treated him the same. That became his shining moment. Bill Burr unleashed a torrent of witty rage that was so glorious that even the angry, rowdy crowd set aside their own inane contempt to laugh in praise of the miracle that they had just witnessed. That moment was special because it defined Bill Burr.Since then, Burr has been busy as ever.

For the ones who did not die of large pulmonary emboli, they died of the extensive inflammation within the lungs, meaning pneumonia with ARDS. In these cases, the lungs were wet and heavy, much like a sponge that is saturated with water. The surfaces of the lung often had a distinct patchy pattern, with pale areas alternating with slightly protruding and firm, deep reddish-blue hypercapillarized areas. This is indicative of areas of intense inflammation, with endothelial dysfunction that can be seen at the microscopic level. When they look at slices of the lungs under the microscope, they found diffuse alveolar damage in 8 cases. Specifically, they saw hyaline membrane formation, and tiny clots in the capillaries, and capillaries that were engorged with red blood cells, and other inflammatory findings. All these findings represent ARDS. They also found lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, infiltrated these areas of infiltration.  This fits the picture of viral pathogenesis.They also looked at the pharynx of these patients, meaning in their throat. The lining of the throat, or mucosa, was hyperemic, meaning very red and irritated, and at the microscopic level, they saw lymphocytes invading there, which is consistent with a viral infection. In one case, a patient had lymphocytes invade his heart muscle, findings that are consistent with what we call viral myocarditis. More than half of the patients in this study had large blood clots. One-third of the patients had pulmonary embolism as the direct cause of death. All the others died of intense inflammation in their lungs related to pneumonia with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Recently there‚Äôs been studies showing that about 1/3rd of patients with severe COVID have blood clots. Another study of 191 patients with coronavirus aka COVID-19, half of those who died had clots, compared with 7% of survivors. And levels of D-dimer that were greater than 1000 ¬µg/L were associated with a fatal outcome. So it's pretty clear now that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing a lot of clots to form in moderate to severe COVID disease.How is this happening? It's likely a combination of reasons, that has to do with downregulation of the ACE2 receptor in the lung alveoli, with a subsequent shift towards having more angiotensin II in the lungs, and less angiotensin 1-7 and 1-9 in the lungs, and when this happens, this leads to more cytokine storm with more inflammation, more constriction of pulmonary arteries, and more clots that develop. That, in turn, leads to more endothelial dysfunction in the capillaries that surround the alveoli. Also, there is evidence that the virus attaches to the ACE2 receptors of those endothelial cells that line those capillaries, which further propagates inflammation and clotting. And in the cytokine storm that develops there, RANTES, a chemokine, binds to the CCR5 receptor of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, and that causes those lymphocytes to infiltrate those areas of inflammation, and in doing so, further contributes towards the inflammatory reaction. This is why we are seeing low levels of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in severe COVID. Endothelial damage can also lead to the development of antiphospholipid antibodies, and these antibodies are bad because they trigger the formation of blood clots. That‚Äôs why patients who have clots with the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome need to be on blood thinners. Also, 11 out of the 12 patients in this study had underlying heart disease and were obese. These are known risk factors not just for cardiovascular disease, but also known risk factors for endothelial dysfunction, and are known risk factors for COVID.  So the big takeaways from the findings in this study are that most people who die of COVID, it's primarily a lung problem. Either related to inflammation with ARDS and/or blood clots.Antiphospholipid syndrome might be a commonality among patients with thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.Dr. Mike Hansen, MDInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care MedicineWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/Instagram Account: http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/#coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19","PT13M43S","2020-05-14","2020-05-14",222223,"/results?search_query=United+States&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKQ3pZeTVJUzE2bFFSUXJmZVE1SzVPeHc%253D","UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A",20,"y6h8TIxeg1g",NA,NA

It‚Äôs a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.Everything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it ‚ÄúThe Central Park.‚Äù In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present.

It has been ranked as the least affordable housing market on Earth for eight years in a row, and the price per square foot seems to be only going up. The inflated prices are forcing Hongkongers to squeeze into unconventionally small spaces that can affect their quality of life. Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are living in spaces that range from 75 to 140 square feet. To put that in perspective, the average parking space in the US is about 150 square feet. And in the most extreme cases, Hongkongers have resorted to homes the size of a coffin. I spent some time exploring the living situation in Hong Kong to find out why housing has become so expensive and spaces so tight.

They worked all over the country in cotton mills, glass blowing factories, sardine canneries, farms, and even coal mines. In an effort to expose this exploitation of children, the National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to travel around the country and investigate and report on the labor conditions of children. Lewis Wickes Hine photographed and interviewed kids, some as young as 4 years old, and published his findings in various Progressive magazines and newspapers. Once the public saw the plight of these children, state legislatures were pressured to pass bills regulating labor for workers under the age of 18, effectively bringing an end to child labor in the United States.

But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.Here‚Äôs where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether healthy people should also wear masks to protect themselves from infection.The truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won‚Äôt get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they‚Äôre most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.But experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks matters a lot less when you consider one of Covid-19‚Äôs most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease‚Äôs long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it‚Äôs almost impossible to be completely sure that you don‚Äôt already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.More of Vox.com's coverage of face masks: https://www.vox.com/2020/3/31/2119813...An in-depth explainer on viral respiratory particle behavior and covid-19 transmission: https://medium.com/@Cancerwarrior/cov...The US Center for Disease Control's current guidance on face masks: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-...An MIT disease transmission researcher's study on respiratory droplets and aerosols: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama...Ed Yong's great explainer on the confusion around face masks: https://www.theatlantic.com/health/ar...For the full Schlieren mirror video from Bauhaus University, Weimar: https://vimeo.com/399120258The World Health Organization's updated recommendations on face mask use: https://www.who.int/publications-deta...Our source for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases: https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-relea...The headline on this piece has been updated.

Then I look at the exclaves of Germany within Belgium, the disputed border between India, Pakistan, and China.  Croatia has complex border with 2 of its neighbours - Serbia and Slovenia.

Of course, there are more complex borders in the world, but this video looks at some of my favourites. I look at the 3 enclaves countries of the world: Vatican City, San Marino and Lesotho. As well as Campione d'Italia, an Italian exclave which is an enclave of Switzerland. I then take things up a notch and look at enclaves within enclaves. The town of Baarle which is in the Netherlands and Belgium is an incredibly complicated border. But not quite as much as the Cooch Behar region of India and Bangladesh. This is followed by a look at the odd situation of Bir Tawil, the only unclaimed land on Earth outside of Antarctica (which is itself a place for complex borders!)I finish off the video by looking at the island of Cyprus, which may look like a borderless island, but is in fact far from it!**COPYRIGHT INFORMATION***IMAGES*All images used are: public domain; licensed under Creative Commons with attribution; or used with permission.
