Newsnight,YAV_0s1c2V4,"[""Dawkins is famous as the author of The Selfish Gene the blind watchmaker and many other popular science books going back decades but he's a controversial figure out and about on Twitter these days railing against fundamentalist religious beliefs and non fundamentalist beliefs in ways that many have found objectionable he has his own foundations for reason and science one here one in the u.s. designed to try and remove the influence of religion from education and public life with religion community relations and tolerance much in the news at the moment we thought we'd get his take in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks we were in the midst of a big debate really are we about the relationship between religious fundamentalists and the rest of society it was interesting that the former Archbishop of Canterbury on Newsnight last week said the debate isn't really won between Christians and Muslims it's more between the secular society and Muslims which I thought was an interesting observation but what do you think the rules of the game should be between a modern liberal democracy between these different groups you have very very different yes I mean I think that's oh that's a very profoundly important question I think the rules of the game are that you should be allowed to believe anything you like and of course that's for that's right but that you shouldn't impose your beliefs on other people and so any creed that thinks it has the right to say not only do we believe this but you've got to believe it too or else I mean that is a very very serious violation of everything that democracy stands for so let's take some examples could burqa bans they have a burqa ban in France you wouldn't be in favor of that I know I I'm not in favor of a burka ban it seems to me to be a violation of individual liberty so it mean when I see a woman in a fall in a full burqa with just justice lit by feel personally offended but it's part of it's an important part of what I believe that what I feel personally is irrelevant it doesn't matter what I feel nobody else should abide by what I feel and that applies of course on the other side as well what about religious schools so a community sets up a school maybe pays for it itself that doesn't subscribe to your views of Education that you've set out today and now is that a freedom of speech thing for them to be able to teach what they want or not that's very difficult because there there were trespassing on the the tussle between the freedom of speech of parents to impose their views on children and the freedom of children to be educated without having erroneous views and we now know that in some cases it definitely is erroneous this is not a matter of opinion imposed upon them but you're not against teaching history and things like that oh heavens no no attractive her very keen on teaching history teaching literature very keen on teaching religion as a matter of fact I mean teaching about religion not indoctrinating in any particular religion because that good right against the spirit or critical thinking it's a tricky one though isn't it because you can't build a society on the basis that you know you're right and you know that other people are wrong can you because the liberal society is we don't have to make that decision no that's your I decide yes you think and you decide what you think but you are really saying that they have to teach children have to be taught in your Creed well no no at night that there is a difference I mean let me use the example you've just used of the the but the burka ban that's a matter of opinion and they're the society it seems to me has no right to impose on other people evolution is not a matter of opinion it's a matter of fact the evidence is as overwhelming as in the case of oh that the Earth orbits the Sun that's not up for dispute you are in the camber as really I probably associated as being one of the most and I think the disparaging phrases militant atheists in the property um what do you think of that phrase what do you think of that accusation and do you if you like revel in that place or do you hate it when people try and if you like put you in the same category as fanatics on other sides of the religious well fanatics religious fanatics are apt to take the law into their own hands on occasion out there and actually threaten people actually use physical violence but you choose to go onto Twitter it's not a scientific a venue for scientific debate you choose to go on Twitter just to take one example a tweet in which you drew a very invidious comparison between the number of Nobel Prizes won by people from Trinity College Cambridge and the entire Muslim population of the world Trinity code College Cambridge comes out on top on that of that comparison now not disputing the factual basis of it why make such an invidious comparison why raise that why raise the issue what is it what's the point of of drawing attention it is a fact that in the Dark Ages and Middle Ages the Islamic world was a beacon of scientific progress and enlightenment and something has gone wrong I had dinner with the then Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks a few months ago and learned there the astonishing fact that between 20 and 25 percent of all scientific Nobel Prizes have been won by Jews and I thought that was a stunning fact it really is I mean when you think of the total population of Jews in the world is is tiny compared to really any other of the major major religions so I I wanted to make this point that Islam has stagnated in the scientific field since them since the Middle Ages and the best comparison to make would have been with Jews and then I thought oh no I can't do that because that may really have upset people because of Palestine and I'm very sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people in Israel so at the last minute I crossed out Jews and stuck in Trinity College Cambridge but I can think of much more gentlemanly ways of making the intellectual point that Islam has not being a great story country it's just a fact whether or not it upsets people is less important to me than the dramatic nature of the fad which ought to be looked at somebody ought to be saying why but you would agree that you pick an argument with people of religion or religions don't make an argument suggest your way to say thing with the Sun pointed about that religion or those groups of people it's a good point that the best way to convert people is not necessarily to tell them their ideas and I have occasionally seemed guilty of that for example I once wrote in The New York Times that anyone who doesn't believe in evolution is either ignorant stupid or insane now that sounds like an extreme point of view it's actually a factual point of view because the word ignorant is not a disparaging word I make the rent of all sorts of things and so are you I'm sure and we would be quite happy to own up to being ignorant of many things ignorant of music or ignorant of art or what even were to baseball whatever it might be I think a lot of moderate religious people are very turned off by your by your disco well some may be and that's that's a political that may be my political error there are technical error in terms because your job you see your role is trying to convert the world to your point of view I think I mean no I see I see my role as crying to try to persuade people to think for themselves and look at evidence that's I mean if they come round to my point of view as a result of looking at evidence then so much the better have you ever been wrong about anything important oh yeah give me for that what well I'd have to go into sort of rather recondite scientific matters but I've I've been wrong on scientific questions and have said so scientists actually rather like being wrong it's it's it's unlike politicians they get a sort of kudos from from admitting that they're wrong because that's how science proceeds Richard Dawkins thank you thank you very much""]"
1,0,What would a second wave look like? | CNBC Explains,Past pandemics have shown that multiple waves of infection are likely and tend to be more severe. Despite warnings from health experts and economists about against easing restrictions too soon — not only to protect lives but also the economy — there is growing opposition against the social distancing measures. CNBC’s Tom Chitty explains.-----Subscribe to us on YouTube: http://cnb.cx/2wuoARMSubscribe to CNBC International TV on YouTube: https://cnb.cx/2NGytpzLike our Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/cnbcinternat...Follow us on Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/cnbcinterna...Follow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/CNBCi#CNBC #Coronavirus #Economy,CNBC International,Hc2kSVBuDns,"[""Of the last five pandemics the world has faced\nin about a century, four had multiple waves\nof infection outbreaks. In some cases the second or third waves\nturned out to be far more severe than the first. As governments around the world weigh the trade-offs\nbetween reopening their economies and continuing lockdown restrictions,\nwhat can we learn from history? The worst pandemic in modern history,\nthe Spanish flu, which is estimated to have infected\na third of the world’s population, had three waves of infection. The first wave was in the spring of 1918,\nwhile the second wave happened in autumn that year. The third wave occurred a few months later,\nwhich lasted till the spring of 1919. You can see the pandemic peaked\nin the highly fatal second wave, which was responsible\nfor most of the deaths. Many health experts have said\nthat history may repeat itself. The World Health Organization has warned that\nthe worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is yet to come. But with widespread unemployment\nand many companies battling to stay afloat, there are calls to end the social restrictions\nand reopen the economy. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also lashed out at\ngovernment stay at home orders as “fascist”. And that's a feeling shared\nby an increasing number of Americans. You heard Elon Musk’s comments.\nI think that reflects a growing sentiment in this country where people\nwant this to be over. So that is going to tug against\nwhat the governors have to do. They have tough decisions to face. However, many analysts have warned\nagainst reopening the economy too soon, which may derail current efforts\nto stem the crisis. The island of Hokkaido\nin the northern part of Japan was forced back into a lockdown after a second wave\nhit the region more severely than the first. Singapore, which was lauded for\nits early efforts to stem the pandemic, also recorded a second wave\nof infections in March, mainly from imported cases and\nmigrant workers living in packed dormitories. A survey of more than 40\nprominent economists in the U.S. found that 80% agreed easing severe lockdown\nwhen infection risk remains high would lead to greater\neconomic damage. As the debate over when to\nreopen the economy drags on, the Spanish flu offers some clues. In 1918, the U.S. had no coordinated\npandemic plans at a federal level. It was therefore left\nto local authorities to decide how and when to intervene\nto prevent the spread of the disease. The social distancing measures over a century ago\nare similar to the modern-day restrictions such as the closure of schools, offices\nand the banning of mass gatherings. Because tackling the infection spread\nwas orchestrated at a local level, the interventions varied widely.\nThis led to the mortality rates and the pace of economic recovery differing\nfrom city to city at the end of the pandemic. In 1917, a year before the Spanish flu outbreak,\nPhiladelphia and St. Louis had very similar mortality rates from influenza and pneumonia.\nHowever, when the pandemic broke a year later, the two cities had very different approaches\nto tackling the outbreak. Philadelphia was very late\nto implement social restrictions and even allowed a large street parade\ninvolving some 200,000 people to go ahead in the\nmiddle of the outbreak. Three days after the parade, every bed was filled\nin Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals. In contrast, St. Louis officials intervened quickly,\nresulting in a much lower death rate. The evidence also shows that cities which\nintervened sooner and more decisively saw their economies grow faster\nafter the pandemic was over. For instance, this graph shows how cities\nwith stricter social distancing measures recovered faster\none year after the 1918 pandemic. However, cities in red, with more lenient measures\ngenerally performed worse. In cities that implemented social distancing measures\nquickly and for longer, manufacturing activity and banking assets also saw\nincreased growth a year after the pandemic was over. The evidence suggests that\naggressive social distancing measures not only reduced mortality rates\nbut were also economically beneficial. While there are important economic lessons\nto be learnt from the Spanish flu of 1918, it’s difficult to compare that pandemic,\nwhich occurred more than a hundred years ago, with the coronavirus pandemic of today.\nAdvances in technology, global supply chains, the larger role of services and better communication\ntools may ease the economic fallout significantly, which limits direct comparisons\nbetween the two pandemics. However, the evidence does imply\nthat decisive social restrictions to reduce the severity of a pandemic plays\na key role in the economic recovery process. So how can both livelihoods\nand lives be saved? While there are no easy answers,\nrevisiting the past offers a glimpse into the future. After all, a healthy economy doesn’t happen\nwithout a healthy population. Hi guys.\nThanks for watching our video.

2,0,Ricky Gervais and Richard Dawkins in Conversation,"Multi-award-winning stand-up comedian, screenwriter, and actor Ricky Gervais was presented with this year’s Richard Dawkins Award, from the Center for Inquiry. CFI campaigns to remove the influence of religion in science education and public policy, and to eliminate the stigma that surrounds atheism and non-belief.The Richard Dawkins Award has been presented annually since 2003. Past winners have included philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, activist and feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and actor and writer Stephen Fry.This event was an unscripted conversation between Gervais and Dawkins, in which everything is on the table and nothing is sacred. They were joined by host, best-selling author and professor of psychology, Richard Wiseman.",Center for Inquiry,b0BC3F0kqtw,"[""Oh, thank you Fairey Thank you Thank you. Very fine. Thank you for their spontaneous. Welcome. That's very much appreciated So this evening we have a wonderful time wonderful time are we going to be talking about it's Kept us in about humanism and rationality and some of the things are happening in the world today and hopefully some jokes as well What more what more could you ask for so I'm going to ask you to give a very warm welcome to our first speaker Please welcome all the weight flown a long way to be here to be with us this evening Robin blunder Hello Hello everyone. Welcome to the 17th Richard Dawkins award celebration. My name is Robyn bellum nur I'm the CEO of the Center for inquiry and executive director of the Richard Dawkins foundation for reason and science in the US Now these organizations have recently merged our shared mission is to promote the separation of church and state the rights of non-believers and atheists around the world and the end to pseudoscience wherever that arises so Thank you So with equal vigor we fight against the regressive forces of the religious, right and the anti science anti-vaccination movement on the Left we We stand against those who would defraud the gullible with their nonsense claims of Communing with the dead and psychic powers and we fight against the industry that markets worthless alternative medicine such as Homeopathy and I understand your Prince Charles could use a talking to about that Which would one of you do that for me, please? So if they're at the Center for inquiry and the Richard Dawkins foundation Our job is to engage people's rational faculties. We hold religious dogma up to scrutiny Which is where it goes to die We reject superstition because it's bollocks. I know your word and As a natural consequence of all of this we bring people to atheism Now making people into atheists is not particularly easy in the United States I mean, we're a highly religious country and of course We don't have the great tool for doing that that you have in Great Britain the Church of England So tonight tonight is a celebration of critical thinking at its most brilliant and witty Richard Dawkins, Ricky Ricky Gervais and Richard Weissman are among the world's greatest living ambassadors of reason in science And it's pretty history-making to have them all onstage together Tonight the amazing Ricky Gervais swill join the ranks of other Richard Dawkins Award winners Including people like Bill Maher and ayaan Hirsi Ali and your own Christopher Hitchens and Stephen Fry What these extraordinary Award winners have in common is their I'll have to look at the table later What they all have in common is their willingness to slay mythology's that people cling to it ad evidence and As a result each has helped to advance human progress and humanist values Now some people see religion as a benign force or even a force for good but because it's not true it has to use techniques other than logic and Human reason to keep a grip on its adherents and this plays out in highly destructive ways around the world In the rejection of science because ideas like evolution are at odds with the biblical account of creation in groundless and irrational dogmas finding their way into law resulting in the discrimination against LGBTQ people and limits on women's reproductive freedom and this is all bad enough in countries with a Judeo-christianity background, but in Muslim countries, there's an even heightened epidemic of bad effects in 13 countries of the world atheism is a capital offense You can be put to death for non belief So one of the programs of the Richard Dawkins Foundation and the Center for inquiry is called secular rescue and as the name implies It rescues people around the world who are risk from simply being an atheist or criticizing religion We have literally helped dozens of atheists leave their homes and find safety Thereby escaping prison mob violence and even death and another intellectual lifeline Around the world is through our translations project We provide access to the books of Richard Dawkins Translated into languages dominant in the Muslim world And they are offered as a free download. So that means native speakers in Arabic Urdu Indonesian and Farsi can now obtain The God Delusion and Richards books on evolutionary biology with a click of a mouse We know we know that an earlier copy of The God Delusion Translated into Arabic. That was a bootleg copy Has been downloaded more than 13 million times and three million of those in Saudi Arabia alone So At the Richard Dawkins foundation we're bringing the truth of science to places where that's heretical and we are bringing a religious doubt to places where such such questions are treasonous and despite the odds This is a hopeful endeavor We are spreading the Enlightenment values and we are unleashing the power of human reason So, please consider joining our efforts supporting our efforts by becoming a member You know the famed mathematician and evolutionary biologist JBS Haldane said quote There is no great invention from fire to flying Which has not been hailed as an insult to some God So tonight I say let the insults begin. Thank you Fantastic class Thank You, Robin Tonight obviously, we're here to celebrate the 2019 Richard Dawkins award And I mean, it's absolute pleasure to introduce somebody who has never received that award Please welcome Richard Dawkins I'm sorry to say I hadn't seen any of Ricky's wonderful shows and I met him for the first time it was backstage in a London theatre where the comedian Robin intz had organised an Alternative Christmas a Christmas for atheists. I Was one of the many performers and Robin had lined up some really big names as well including Ricky Gervais as one of the star turns I Was astounded by the audacity of his act It reminded me of a New York Times review of Tom Lehrer that wonderfully witty American songwriter and performer the New York Times said Mr. Lara's Muse is not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste Well Ricky's act was like that only more so I found his script literally shocking and I don't shock easily Naturally this drew Me to him How I asked him did you get away with it? He admitted that he was using the Atheist audience as a testbed to try out ideas and see just how far he could go Before subjecting a real audience to a more generally acceptable version. He was he was pushing the envelope numbers rephrased that he was using the Atheist audience to reach way outside the envelope In order to calibrate where the bounds might be for an ordinary there. I say less interesting audience. I Next met Ricky when I interviewed him for one of my channel 4 Documentaries we pretty much agreed about everything Some people think that makes for bad television It's not exciting the public want disagreement Well, I've never thought that agreement can be interesting as well as verbal fisticuffs It doesn't have to be tame and bland and I need hardly say there's nothing tame or bland about Ricky Gervais his comedy Equally gives offense not least in his splendidly irreverent takedowns of Hollywood celebs in his presentations of the Golden Globe and Things like that if there was a Golden Globe for seeing how far you can go and just getting away with it Ricky would win hands down And he's so witty and entertaining with it More recently. I've been watched his various drama series The Office Derek extras afterlife And what I've learned is that He's a truly great playwright and actor as well as a stand-up comedian The character of David Brent in the office is so sensitively written I found the embarrassment of it too near the bone always couldn't bear to go on watching like Like 48 hours, but I also admire Perhaps my favorite of all his shows is Derek where Ricky plays a supremely kind and gentle half-wit it's It's a piece of acting genius, but he also shows his writing genius as for afterlife It almost had me in tears. It's so movingly clever Ricky is not just a stand-up comedian. Not just a great comic actor. He's an outstandingly creative writer as well Like Woody Allen except Ricky is capable of playing more than one character I'm going to end my acclamation of this witty hero of Atheism and reason with a long series of quotations from him because I think they're so wonderful on life and death It's a strange myth that atheists have nothing to live for it's the opposite We have nothing to die for we have everything to live for It's amazing life there's so much to live for as for death they said That's the best thing about being dead. You don't know about it. It's like being stupid. It's only painful for others The doctrine of hell is one of the most evil things about both Christianity and Islam at least it is to the extent that people really believe it but as Ricky points out a Christian telling an atheist they're going to hell is as scary as a child telling an adult. They're not getting any presents from Santa Another wonderful Sallie remember if you don't sin Jesus died for nothing On morality and the absurd myths that you need religion to be good Do unto others is a good rule of some I live by that Forgiveness is probably the greatest virtue there is but that's exactly what it is a virtue. Not just a Christian virtue No, one owns being good. I'm good. I just don't believe I'll be rewarded for it in heaven My reward is here and now it's knowing that I try to do the right thing that I lived a good life and that's where spirituality really lost its way when it became a stick to beat people with do this or you will burn in hell you Won't burn in hell, but be nice anyway And one of the nice what are the things that you'll notice about Ricky if you follow him on Twitter, for example He's how nice he is is he can be cutting in his wit? And he can of course give a fence but he has a wonderful gentle side as well Frequently to non-human animals, but to human animals as well when asked once whether he believed in God his reply was I believe in dogs? as for Twitter itself I can strongly emphasize with this Arguing with morons on Twitter. He's like correcting graffiti on a public toilet wall that you'll never need to use again. I Read that Ricky had an early ambition to be a scientist and his attitude to science seems to me exactly right Of course, he wouldn't claim to be a scientist to quote him Science seeks the truth and it does not discriminate for better or worse. It finds things out Science is humble. It knows what it knows and it knows what it doesn't know It bases its conclusions and beliefs on hard evidence Evidence that is constantly updated and upgraded It doesn't get offended when new facts come along. It embraces the body of knowledge It doesn't hold on to medieval practices because they are traditional and The following seems to me to show an admirably a scientific attitude to theology The existence of God is not subjective He either exists or he doesn't it's not a matter of opinion. You can have your own opinions, but you can't have your own facts Ricky is immensely famous, of course, and he's very gracious about being stopped in the street and other aspects of Fame But being famous also prompted are typically witty Remark on the subject of the widespread belief that only religious people are moral Being famous is like believing in God Someone's watching you all the time I've never quite known how to cope with the retort that it's only Extremists who get a religion a bad name Ricky's answer to that at least hits one nail on the head You can easily spot any religion of peace. It's extremist members would be extremely peaceful Literary scholars have sometimes pointed out how fine can be the line between tragedy and comedy? Some of the greatest comedians and comic characters have been close to crotchety Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton, Tony Hancock Falstaff Basil Fawlty Ricky Gervais is one of the world's great comedians, but unlike some comedians. He's not himself a tragic figure. He's a happy man with an endearing smile a laughing court jester in a dark time He uses humor to lift us all out of despond Other comedians may do that in Escapist way making us laugh as a way of running away from the dark reality of life Ricky doesn't do that on the contrary he goes right to the heart of the darkness tackles the evils of life and the evil people by confronting them head-on and Laughing at them as he himself said if you can't joke about the most horrendous things in the world What's the point of jokes? What's the point in having humor humor is to get us over terrible things Ladies and gentlemen atheists and rationalists I give you a great hero of our movement our own wittily creative infectiously laughing court jester ricky gervais Fantastic I can take that back from you. I directly I sit down that's it Now Richard digits you have been all in black that would look really amazing trick I think you do have the power of your mind. That was amazing So we're going to chat about I'm gonna start off picking up on one of the topics you mentioned there Which is I think many people in the public atheists of this Reputation for being a little bit down in the world and a little bit pessimistic Are you I mean, we're living in quite a difficult time in the moment. I are you optimistic people. Are you optimistic about the future? well I don't know I'm happy. I've always been happy I've been at I have I was I've always tried to get the most out of life It was I I worked out early on that. That was the shortcut. I wanted. I just wanted to be happy I did that first and then decided how I was going to sort of make a living am I optimistic I Mean I've got nothing to fear I look at this Bit like a holiday. We don't exist for thirteen and a half billion years Then we exist for 80 90 100 years if we're lucky and you experience everything it's amazing I mean It's amazing to be alive the chances of us being here as us that sperm hitting that egg is four hundred trillion to one It's incredible that we're here, you know, and then we die never to exist again, you know And then some people even get offended by me saying that they that they say things like I'm You don't know that I'll probably live again are you know some summer said on Twitter once to me? Why don't you pray just in case there's a god? And I said, why don't you put garlic over your door just in case there's a Dracula I've got I've got no problem with with praying, you know, I'd you know, I It doesn't bother me for I've never been bothered by spirituality I don't believe in it, but it's I never a personal belief has never been a danger Um, I was so religion is something else and not even just religion But Dogma dogmas that is the dangerous bit and it just really exist in religion it exists in more and more places now that cultism that that which shouldn't be questioned anything that You know, that's that's what you want a question. If someone says you shouldn't question this though You've got you've got to question it you've got That Sort experiment about the improbability of being here and all indeed the chance of one sperm eating one egg Yeah, and I love to quote a poem by Aldous Huxley. I think it's called fist philosopher song and it goes a million million spermatozoa All of them alive out of their Cataclysm, but one poor noah dare Hope to survive and all that billion minus one might have chanced to be shakespeare another newton a new done But the one was me Shame to have ousted your betters thus taking arc when the others remained outside Better for all of us fraud homunculus if you'd quietly died That's great But I mean, I Think realistically we probably have to be pessimistic But that's no way to live a life. I think you've got to be optimistic Otherwise is that you you're not gonna have any chance of changing things to make them better So I say I'm realistically a pessimist but I live my life as an optimist And like really I'm happy. Yeah, and I don't think it's and I think you if I get it right your question is geared to Either are we are we worried about not exist again, or are we worried about how where the world's going? Well, there's not a lot we can do about it. Either way, you know, it's not a choice Is that are you gonna die or live? Probably I just live forever Which I probably wouldn't choose or I would then regret it I think the first million years I'd really be kicking myself I've got Why I choose infinity There's no way how I quite absolutely agree with that what's frightening about death is not death itself It's infinity. It's it's eternity. Yeah, I want to spend eternity under a general anesthetic Yes gonna happen exactly. Yeah Oh, yeah and Bentham, you know We don't know we don't know but I imagine it's like the thirteen and a half Billion years before we were born and that was fine Well, um, before we started I did put on Twitter a a call for questions Regarding in some yeah their needs. How are you asking for it? Well, the first question was to Richard actually, which is about Charles Darwin Created the theory of evolution. How did animals change before that? So that's not that's a joke That's a joke, isn't it that you may better I'll make that one up I know though, yep, but listen, okay That is a joke, but it's no more stupid than some real one Okay, the the the the one that obviously everyone gets and I used to be frivolous and I used to do not now I just answer him seriously. Um if we evolved from apes Why are there still Apes around I used to say things like well If god made man from dust, why is there still dust around and things that you know? but now I say well we didn't evolve from modern age we evolved with modern Apes from a common ancestor rather like and I just answer it deadly deadly serious like they You know, it doesn't help Someone someone followed it up with Well, I've been that that go into the same zoo for twenty four years and I haven't seen one monkey turn into a person But I think I think even though that's incredibly stupid We think actually it shows what the problem is when people try and understand it They can't grasp the scale of it. They can't imagine these tiny changes. No one can imagine fifty million years So they do expect them to the chimp to go. Come on lad And that's because they also give it a will They think they think even non-religious people are trying to understand you. They try and think that the the giraffe was Really stretching his neck, you know That's the problem. There's lots of little logical problems that hasn't been explained properly But actually it's if I can understand it anyone can you know and Richard you must have been asked many? Stupid questions over the years. Is there a standout stupid question for you? Yes Well, the one that really just mentioned but there's also why did we ever see a Crocodoc? What that's a good question great question, I would love that I would love a car I've actually got a Crocodoc toy that somebody gave me What image have you got in mind for a Crocodoc a Crocodoc would be a crocodile that we angry but he's fucked because he just got a bill That's like my time Implication of that is that there should be an intermediate between every animal and every other animal. I think there should be that way You can get crocodile. Well, I cut they they they can't see that it's nearly an analogue thing as well and and I think you've spoken at least before you're you're amazing model about if you took a picture of your dad and your Grandparents and their dad you at any one point you go. They look alike, but at some point is a fish You know Eventually, there's a fish. I didn't see that coming what you did do you sued you know, it says that they again it's the best the scale the scale is is unimaginable, it's lucky that it did happen because we couldn't imagine it if it wasn't fact we couldn't make that up because it's Incredible it's incredible. It's probably true But whenever I've done that it always gets a gasp of astonishment why I mean everybody knows we're descended from fish Yeah, well the way I put it is them if you could meet your two hundred million greats grandfather You would eat him with a slice of lemon and tartar sauce. Yes, exactly yeah, yeah, I Split it is there is the scale though, isn't it? And then is it true? We're closer. I know I know closer Is it a non-scientific term, but I'd like these facts as well that go around that we're evolutionary speaking I think they mean in time we're closer To a salmon than a salmon is to a shark Respectable thing to say about yeah, nothing wrong with that. All it means is that we are close to cousins That means to say that the common ancestor that we share with salmon lived a lot more recently than the common ancestor that salmon Yes, sure Yeah, so it is a Crocodoc possible Okay, listen let me RTR take this I'm a psychologist. So I mean I can answer this Is that a possibility in a parallel universe? Oh, here we go I Did a podcast with Lawrence Krauss and he was definitely saying things that I had to just wind me up just when I started Understanding it. He'd throw in something else. I got why are you doing that? Well, it is true that when duckbill platypuses were first Sent back to the museum here Nobody believed they were real. They thought it was a hoax. They thought that somebody had taken a duck's bill and sent onto Some other kind of kind of creature so I suppose that's the nearest approach to a Crocker duck and that is real Because it's only monotreme that it produces eggs and milk. It could make its own custard It doesn't but it Could I use the instant stuff so it could use that as well together whisk it will be fine. Yes. It is amazing. I mean Some Australian mammals. It's because is it true that? It floated away and there weren't predators as such so and there were predators Actually, they didn't they they most had gone extinct. There was a giant Predatory carnivorous kangaroo for example must've been quite terrifying bounding after you with its jaws a gape. Yeah We should bring them back yeah, I think so. Yes. Can we now now you Started it but not into an idiot on Twitter. No, can we bring back the mammoths, you know can't we? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome The greatest thing ever can we can we bring back the mammoths there is a serious possibility The genome of the mammoths is being pretty much worked out and The technology to actually bring it back is isn't there yet? We've got the genome and so it doesn't seem totally impossible that you could now. What does that mean? Do you mean you've synthesized something or you've put together bits of day-night or the DNA exists? And you've you found in the elephant and modified it. What does it mean? We've got the we've got the well mean you've got the thing that would Make a mammoth if it was well, because frozen mammoths died sufficiently recently and they're frozen in in the Arctic so that there's plenty of Tissue there. You can get plenty of DNA There's a lovely Hilaire Belloc poem about the frozen mammoths which ends up I Can't remember how it goes, but it's the skin beat you it fit will make an excellent soup But the snag is if the skin be but punctured before it is boiled Your conception is wholly and utterly spoiled and hence on account of the size of the beast The dainty is nearly unknown. But anyway, there it is. It's it's if you don't know the answer Richard just say so Right, you asked to this it's So high, you know you how would we bring it back? How could how what is the process? What would we do the process is that you use the you use the soft tissues of this frozen mammoth? Sequence the DNA and that's pretty much been done with a little bit of filling in with the elephant DNA as well Now what we don't yet have the ability to do is to implant that DNA into an elephant egg Right, then put the elephant egg into a put the elephant egg with mammoth DNA Into a female elephant and then grow the embryo so it'd be it would be a hybrid Mostly no. No. No, how would you how could you see? Oh, so you'd clone? Oh you'd cloned the Dolly the sheep. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it would be that kind of thing so dolly had it was a sheep egg and into that sheep egg was it was put the DNA of another sheep, right? And so and then If a mammoth baby come out wouldn't that surprise the elephant? No doubt. Yes, no doubt. A lot of people have hairy babies And fast and everything like Elephants have got tasks. Ostrich is just hairier than this. Yeah, if if you could Clone a mammoth Would you do it not clubbing would you would you? I would but there are many who wouldn't there are many think it would be unethical somehow to do this. They think It would be um cruel Why would it be cruel because it wouldn't ever be in its natural habitat. Well If you made lots of them, there's some people think that we should actually clone, lots of them and let them loose on them on the Siberian tundra - to him, you know bring back the ecology that I'd bring back Tyrannosaurus Rex I let it loose in parts of England to be honest Would you do if you could if you were part of the committee deciding whether to bring back a mammoth, how would you vote I Don't know why I would I would I would I be doing it just cuz I could Because that's summoned to be said He what he what I Don't know what Yeah, yes. I don't know about I'm not I'm not certain the answer I was a lot more comfortable. We talking about Crocodoc slow. I'll give you that so Okay, so we'll move it. I'm the away from mammoths n' and crocodiles D So atheism. Yeah, so I can remember I don't know if this has any resonance for YouTube I can remember listening to you on the radio. I can't place this I know it's a long time ago and I would think it's after The initial success of the office I think and I think it's Steve right? I might be wrong and he said something like Oh, you must wake up in the morning and say thank God for my amazing things that are happening And you said why would I say thank God. I'm an atheist right? And it was the first time I'd heard the word atheist I'm kind of public radio well, I mean yeah, there shouldn't even be the word should there if people didn't invent gods I wouldn't have to deny them and it's just It's like I I was told when I sort of started breaking America to not mention, I was Nathan really first thing I did on everybody First thing I did why what what am I gonna do imagine? Imagine not doing something because people hate you because of what you are. That's that's you know That's my only thing I've got I'm a white rich middle class man, but I'm at least I'm hated for being an atheist you know, I mean I'm oppressed I have oppressed in 13 countries. I'd never go to anyway Have you seen the change in your of the last 20 years or so about how Atheism is perceived. Well, I mean you sort of do it I There's part of me that does it because I think I should that there is someone being persecuted now that might you know I can't I can't change the world But what I mean? maybe someone in a Western world that thinks they shouldn't come out because it's a bad thing because It's still a bad thing in Western society in America they took about up America right the but probably that big bit in the middle of America, but We were voted least trustworthy group joint bottom with rapists So there's still a thing about I better not say I'm an atheist that are annoying my mom or dad or granddad or school There's still that so you do that some of that I do it as an intellectual pursuit because someone asked me a question I'd rather give the right answer than the wrong answer I'd rather tell the truth than lie because it's easier, you know, I think the ability people think I run into churches and go It's all fucking bollocks. I die. I Don't I don't care, you know, I don't But if I'm asked if I believe in God, I'll say no. I mean, you know the tricky one is some I Did a film called the invention of lying where I did a scene where my thank you seven people saw that film Where my mother in that is dying and it's because I'm the only person in the society can lie She says I I don't want to go to nothingness and I go there's not nothing This is a beautiful place you go. And you're young again and I invent heaven right and That comes from a fact that when my mum was dying, I did face dilemma If she'd have said you think there's a god that's that's a personal thing and that's a you know, um So yeah, I am I I try I just try and be honest, really and the other is if if someone else's kid five-year-old asked me do I believe in God I Sort of think. What should I say here? And I say well I don't but a lot of people do what do you think? you know I try and I there's still a a Diploma is not it's not always my place. You don't you know, I mean I'd But you know my house my rules if someone asks me someone Twitter, I turn the truth The last 20 30 years have you seen that a change in how atheism and is is perceived? I'm not just sociologist I haven't done the research. I'm not a psychologist. So I Not sure would only be a subjective impression The statistics suggest that we are growing in numbers Obviously in Western Europe But also even in America I think the number of people who claim no religion in the United States is now more than twenty percent Which is large compared to any particular Religious denomination. So I think that the the statistics show that the trend is in the right direction, but as Ricky says other polls show that we're done down there with rapists in in Terms of public. I think I have to lump us in with You know Agnostics which again? I keep trying to explain that on Twitter that they're not mutually exclusive you know one deals with knowledge one deals with belief and so You know People say on Twitter to me over there. It's a logical to be an atheist You should be agnostic and I say well I am I am as well Agnostic see on your nerves a bit. Well No, because we're all agnostic aren't we we all don't a stick by definition if if we accept that no one knows Knowledge, you know, I'm being very diplomatic here. But if we accept that no one knows that there's a god or not We might be wrong and weird 99% Sure no But let's say we we don't know we're all agnostic. So take it out. It doesn't matter now. We ask about belief What do you believe what's your best bet when someone says they're agnostic if there isn't it sort of attempting to go what do you just think about it a bit more than Because it well, I just think that there's a there's a yes But there's a category mistake some people do do it because they don't want to say they believe in God, you know But if you you shouldn't ask an agnostic if there's a God or not, you should ask them Do you believe there's a god or not? Because then they can't say I don't know because that doesn't make sense Well, you don't know whether you believe or not right, you know, so yeah, I I think the the really sick making thing is people who think because because they're Agnostic, and we can we can't know for sure Therefore the likelihood is 50/50. Hmm. Yeah, very different I mean, it's it's you know, I'm I'm agnostic but I think but I believe that the likelihood is about 1 percent or less Yes Yes, if we accept that, we don't know if it's a default. We don't know no one's come back from heaven No one's proved it you can't prove the non-existence of something and why would you the periodic table of non-existent things is infinite, you know, it's like So if we accept that That's that's a knowledge. That's a category of knowledge. But if you just say, what do you believe? Yeah, you have to step up right you have to say what you believe and if you don't believe in any God You're an atheist. That's the other misconception people think that atheism is denying the existence of God It's not it's just not accepting the claim that there is a God, you know if there were 3 doors which God exists God doesn't exist. I don't know that doesn't make sense There's three doors. It says God exists. It doesn't exist I don't know you not knowing is irrelevant to where there is or isn't the god You can you've done a sleight-of-hand there on a category mistake because one is knowledge and to our beliefs, right what? Session no what? No. No, there's always it. I'm saying 3 is always there if you had to choose one Yeah, it's um, I but I believe There's a god I don't believe there's a god. I don't know. Is it relevant then, isn't it? Crock adducts when So maybe wants my Twitter Twitter questions you spoke about lying there What's the the biggest lie, you've told to impress somebody? is that a question that's been submitted for on Twitter the biggest lie you've told To impress somebody it's quite a tricky question actually, ah the because I've told to impress someone. Yeah, I Honestly can't think of one. Yeah Richard or something. Not only can I not think of one. I'm quite confident. There's never been one You've never told a lie to impress anyone I've told a lie - not hurt people's fear. That's different Yes, I suppose that's to impress them because I want them to like me by not saying so it might exact it So can you come to my party? I say no. I can't I'm giving blood of the orphanage or something No, because I don't want to say of course, I'm not coming to your party. I hate you and all your friends it would be so My lies are usually because I haven't got the nerve to be honest when it's someone's findings. They're all white lies. Yeah, okay But I don't think I've lied - like on a CV or something. I Didn't write the question Okay, there are three doors I believe in God I don't Um, I suppose that works if you say which answer sums you up most that's allowed I think what would the three doors? Yeah, there is no God. There is a God I don't know I'd go for there is no God because I'd want to identify With choosing that door, but there's still the category was saying because one deals with knowledge in one Now the category Maceda background in philosophy, of course your first degrees in philosophy is that my only degree okay Your last degree. Yeah, he made it sound really good Yes, degree a lie to impress exactly. Yeah, in fact my first degree was biology which I did for two weeks And then swapped a velocity there were nine o'clock lectures it was 40 hours a week I suddenly got to university and thought I haven't come here to learn. I've come here to join a band do you not I mean and so that's a category our Philosophy was um, yeah, I did philosophy and I have you ever found that useful well Only that everything is is Useful that you look and he sort of dig well and that's not true. Is it really? I suppose Critical thinking is is useful But I think I already had it or I wouldn't have done science and philosophy So I don't know that issues for other than it's nice to know stuff. It's fun I mean I took it as one of the best things about being alive Learning stuff. I want to know everything. I'm still in awe of the world, honestly I wish this wasn't about me because I'd be quizzing him. He'd get fed up. He'd go for fuck. Shut up I'd be asking him questions all the time And If we turn to your your your work, but I mean fantasy. This is a question to both of you. I think what's interesting Is that your work is? Incredibly innovative. So if you take Selfish Gene or you take the God Delusion It's it's a very it's a very innovative work and God Delusion in particular I mean came out of a time when Atheism wasn't a popular thing to be writing about and you went for it the office I mean just phenomenal in particularly all of your work, but the office we just sort of focus on that. I Where do those ideas come from? What what's the process behind? Innovation in that well, it's very different because Richards dealing in What's true about the universe and I'm making stuff up so so I'm I wouldn't put myself alongside scientists but for me, it's As I get older all I want to be in art in comedy. Whatever is just more honest and look deeper That's all I want to do. Now. That's all I try and do a my being Is this is me. First of all, it's even done before that's what you you don't want to do You want to keep going, you know, this is new but I do want to I am fascinated with honesty and bravery And something as lowly as comedy I think is that is that is that the best thing to and not without? consequence I I think people think that Sometimes you're just trying to offend for the sake of it. That's too easy. That is too easy And I know many people say um, oh, yeah any anyone can just be offensive? Go on then So that on arena and be if it just be offensive see oh, you know, I mean it's ridiculous thing to say So if that's never the aim but I am aware that some people will find everything I do offensive because everyone's different but that's no reason why you shouldn't Shouldn't say it, you know Is a good thing about freedom of speech you have the right to piss off lots of people at once Is that your thoughts as well? And I think that the To say that offends me as though that was somehow an argument yeah is what's really pernicious and I think Stephen Fry said You're offended well so fucking what yeah Yeah, and then Christopher Hitchens said slightly more moderately You're offended I'm still waiting to hear your argument But that's what it is. That's what I offer people have found out now. It's sort of tit-for-tat and At some some of it was a rebellion against the first wave of political correctness where they said well if you can't do that I'm offended by that now what you know, and it was it was but it's another form of dogma It's another form of shutting you down putting the the suffix phobia on the end of something's that means you can't discuss it anymore and You've got to be very careful about that but particular in comedy Most offence is taken when people mistake the subject of a joke with the target They think that subject is a terrible contentious terrible thing to laugh about well never look at the joke though, you know And they don't they go now you shouldn't joke about so-and-so I've been asked by journalists Is there anything you won't joke about and I say is there anything you weren't right about go straight away. They assume a joke is Making fun of the terrible situation or the the victim or the and and and and I don't do that I actually don't do that which and it's fine If you do, I think humor is exempt from those things But I still don't I still have a conscience when I and I try and make my jokes bulletproof now, of course, you've got a make and bulletproof for 10 years time, which is a Which is a problem And is it a question of the audience Perceiving where it's coming from in a sense that you know, if you were racist and you do racist material clue That's a very ugly thing Yeah. No, I think that's the joke. It's work I think the actual what I mean is I think people you can do a joke about race and without being racist and I think that's I think people think that you mustn't do joke about race because they assume it might be they haven't looked it and some people just they just it just scares people a little bit and some people are offended on other people's perhaps you see people in the audience looking around thinking can I laugh or that maybe I shouldn't and even why and I That's why I did in to boost up Jiggs because I want to say we you can laugh at this Look, here's an example of something you can laugh at and I give them examples and I I almost done I defied them not to laugh because It's okay to laugh at bad things. It is. Ok to valpha bad things, but you're not setting out to offend I'm not setting out to offend and I think the targets are my joke of valid. I can defend every joke I've ever made I could even argue that every jerk I've ever made is politically correct, but that That's another that's another man. But yeah, okay not that that matters because there's a difference between being correct and being politically correct and and it's been mugged and changed and now it's A different beast than it was, you know But now I think you're allowed to joke about anything. It's it's what the joke actually is and sticking with your your work for the moment if there was a weird parallel universe where you could only Have written one book or only made one television series or tour film Which one would you be most happy with I? Would be most happy with the extended phenotype No surprise, which is which is the one book I've written for a professional audience. Although I hope other people can read it as well How interesting Site, I thought you would you would go selfish gene or God Delusion. But oh you've written those as well just to remind you I'm actually I admit pretty pleased with all my books here. I must admit but I I think though the one I Think perhaps the one where I made the most original contribution is the extended phenotype. I was quite agreeably surprised when you said you thought The God Delusion was You know Innovative, I'm not sure its innovative Sorry, pull ropes and singing to me. I've gotta stop It's my alarm clock reminding me to take my pills Yeah, I love poor Rosie do you need to take your pills because we can get on if this is gonna get good See I Think the God Delusion was enormous Lee I mean no one was doing books about atheism at that time As far as I can remember know that well not quite true. Actually, Sam Harris was but And I think but but I mean there's really nothing in any of our books that that's not foreshadow didn't say Bertrand Russell The why I'm not a Christian and so on But then you mentioned The Selfish Gene I think that that is more in innovative actually and I think the extended phenotype is more so, okay Okay, I'd probably go with the Old Testament Just because of how popular it was and how well it sold Um, you did phenomenally well with that I'd be just think how rich I mean I could I do better marketing and I'd do better deals Yeah, then those goat herders did I'll have a top US agent and yeah, I got a day young. I was listen to a Woody Allen routine She's the vodka routine he said always my rabbis terrible my rabbis tell um He's giving us sermon. He forgot the Ten Commandments listed the Seven Dwarfs that Was a great joke. Anyway, I digress so if I didn't allow you to agree that your work was with the Old Testament if you weren't allowed to Let's go which of your TV series or films would you go? Well, I mean the office brings to mind again because it was the the first thing I'd try my hardest at and you know So yeah It really Did you know the u.s. Office I'd use Did you know from the the get-go with the office that you've got something very special there, um, yeah, I thought it was special I thought it was different. I sort of came to it the big list of sort of don'ts more than do's because you know you It was very late in life I'd worked in an office for 10 years and I think I was like 38 39. So I knew this was a you know a Second bite at the cherry, so I knew it had to be special and I was happy with that I could walk away knowing that I've done something and is it true that when it was a exported to America? They got a different cast and oh Yeah, well We sold the rights for them to do it. Why didn't they just take your version? Because there was only 12 and I was too lazy to do any more And there's a thing over there. They want that syndications They want a hundred episodes of something and then the the money is exponential because it gets shown in Rotation and you know, so and they did three hundred and something episodes where your episodes shown as well yeah, but It was on BBC America And I think it was the it was the highest rated show on the channel and it got like a million and a half So the US office was getting 10 million a week and the Superbowl episode got 25 million Yes, so it's a it's a different beast. It's just a each episode We made ours for about 120 grand by the end that there's were three million in episode. Yeah Yeah, so it's just it's not even it's not even to be compared. I look at it Like I sold my DNA but it's not my yeah, it's not my kidding I was rather shocked to discover that one of david attenborough's really major series was Redone with an American voice with Oprah Winfrey instead of David Attenborough. I thought that's utter heresy. I mean but presumably She just literally overdubbed the footage she didn't go and remake it or with different No different. I think that Steve Carell as a spider Ya know they just started again just because Americans want things by Americans for Americans ours wouldn't have been big in the big middle bit You know, it's it was and it was different. It was different. They did make it differently. It was more optimistic If it wasn't mine artistically, but it Honestly it it was much more lucrative for me than my version, you know, so Someone like someone on Twitter once sent me The US version of the office is better than yours. How does that make you feel and I sent back fuckin rich But that happens with TV, obviously Americans buy ideas and remake here it doesn't happen with books I mean if someone even American publishers, we love God Delusion. We're gonna get Sam Harris to do it. That wouldn't know me That's true. But what they do is change the title Right. It's been irritating. Um I've actually schooled mega Joon's Either I've actually I've actually bought the same book twice. I didn't realize On one occasion, I thought it you know on Amazon it says if you like so-and-so you will probably like so-and-so Same book Fantastic algorithms correct, isn't it if you like that So, what would they change your titles did they I've never allowed it? but many of my colleagues have had the title has changed, right and I find it unnecessary and Really have nuisance it Matt Ridley says it's because the publishers like to feel important. It's the only thing they can do And so I assumed it was marketing like they wouldn't get that title author. And yeah, they call it marketing Yeah, they call him a heart. Yeah So We were chatting beforehand or second with some friends and one of the the questions came up about comedy and the fact that we couldn't think of many if any comedians Who were religious? Nothing for example I'm just saying is do we think it's a thing that most stand-ups tend to be agnostic or atheist or I think so I think that's because a lot of comedians Are critical thinkers, I think a lot of them a science They're intelligent Well, I don't want to swell we ever. Yeah, but then, you know a lot of a lot of religious people are intelligence but they've been they've been got an early age and it's like oh yeah, I think they're braver some people there's still a thing of not saying I'm an atheist cuz they because people think that it's a Bad thing to be, you know parents still christen their kids because they think it's a respectable thing to do, you know, I And I that that's sad, but I get it There's a couple though there's a couple they don't put it in their act. I don't think a Tim Vine is very devout Yeah, yeah, but in general it they tend to be I think more Skeptical or I think that's because they are they look at things from all angles and they come up with funny ideas, and I'm And I try I I look at the idea and I think that's that that's what's wrong and that's what Dogma does is that people try and give ideas human rights so you leave them alone and You you you you don't have to you can Ridicule ideas without her in anyone and some people say that deserves a round of applause. Oh, thank you And And they and they found it shut some people up if they say that's her you know you can be accused of racism or anything if you if you Criticize an idea and it's people jumping in the way of a bullet and saying why are you shooting at me? And It comes back to Richard's point that I'm offended That's not an argument. It's not an argument. It's like me being offended if someone takes the mickey out of maths it's like Go on yeah fine. Yeah, dude, I mean Because you can laugh at math it doesn't it doesn't affect maths it doesn't affect math And And I like asking this of all performers when you You've done a lot of live work when you go onstage or before you onstage. Do you have any superstitious rituals that you carry out? No No, I'm not superstitious am I Is this a trick? No that if I said yes, I'd go down a vault Look at this footage and deny it no Really? No. I have I probably have loads of Sort of neuroses and OH CDs and things out but nothing based on superstition. It's some Worrying that the audience in is that what it was the air conditioning like is it someone as there's squeaky door who's good? No ice in the drinks someone's putting off. There's someone you know, and I have all those things but I have no superstitions no, what did you mean superstitions or do you mean I mean some performers touchwood to wear certain socks or Nothing. I wear the same clothes because I can't be bothered to think about what else to wear. But I Don't do touchwood. Okay. Um, no, I don't know I Don't know I don't know I just I burn some incense say a couple of prayers That's it really and in terms of changing minds in terms of getting people to be more skeptical or rational or scientific both of you enormous ly Influential but with with two different ways obviously yours using comedy a lot at the time and you're depending more on factual Arguments, how does that play out is is that plain to the same audiences do you think is equally persuasive? Well, I think which is more driven in his What what do you think about changing minds what do you think I'm known to be not very good at it I tend to just as he was saying earlier Ricky just I tend to just tell the truth and That isn't always the right way to go about it marketing wouldn't approve I suspect of just simply going out and telling the truth. I had a rather nice encounter with neil degrasse. Tyson, who? who said something like You just put it out there. You don't there's there's no act of Persuasion. There's no act of seduction going on. You just you just seem to say here are the facts take it or leave it and I had to say I Said I gratefully accept the rebuke But I then went on to say I'm not the worst with that and I quoted Alan Anderson, who was then the editor of New Scientist Who said I asked him what your policy is at New Scientist and he said our policy of New Scientist is science is interesting And if you don't agree you can fuck off. Yeah That's exactly yeah Yeah, I don't I don't I do Of things there there are probably worse things than people believing in all the different gods It doesn't affect me because I'm because I'm free and liberated in' and safe and But yeah You can still be annoyed. It's ignorance that annoys me more than anything. Whatever it is. It's not I don't want to keep going after Religion because that's only one form of this belligerent Willful and and it's not even that it's you. You can't sort of help what you believe in. Most people aren't going around Thinking this llinois people. I'm trying to oppress people's rights. They just think I believe in God because that's how that's how my brain worked when I was little and now I I think is probably a God and most religious people Aren't crazy It's something else again. It's something you know and We worry about the people who believe the bad bits in their holy book as well as the good bits Most nice people who believe in God they can tell the difference They do they know the nicer if they cherry pick and they know the nice bits from the bad bits They don't do the bad bits and my point is if you know the bad bits from the good bits You don't need the holy book, you know, you're already a moral person And with afterlife which I think is phenomenal thank you, um Clearly obviously you talk about a theism in there But it's fundamentally about kindness and living a good life. I I think I think it is I think the question is When you when you lose the best thing about life, is it still worth living? That's that that's what the question starts with this started with a high concept really imagine You lost everything you wouldn't care about anything you do what you wanted. So that was the comedic Where did that thought come from? I don't know. I don't know. I think it might have been Sort of two years of This thing that you've got to watch what you say Like it, wasn't it? It wasn't to say the right thing It was to say the thing that was least offensive to most people which is nonsense. We'd still be in the Middle Ages We'd still be putting leeches down our pants, you know Every every scientist committed heresy at some point every great invention every move forward in progress was going against some sort of crazy dogma at some point and and And it wasn't that there was more Crazy mad nasty people around it was that they weren't ashamed of it anymore in the last few years, you know In my day racist were ashamed Not so and That and the backlash was some people saying oh you can't say anything and I just thought what imagine if you could You just could you didn't care about the consequences? You wouldn't didn't care about offending anyone because that we do we we Even myself and Richard who want to tell the truth We do things we don't want to do all the time because just because we're worried about if we're mugged we hand over the cash Because we don't want to get hurt But imagine if you didn't care about living or dying that happens in afterlife. He thinks bring it on. I'm not scared anymore So that was the idea if you weren't scared about consequence if you weren't scared about politeness if you weren't You had nothing to lose and that was the seed of the idea really? But then of course it becomes about kindness if it becomes becoming about people trying to save you there's the comfort of strangers and the people who care and them and that's the thing about like Grieving and depression the thing that came out of after I thought would shocked me I've never had a reaction like it even the office. I've never had a reaction like it because it was an emotional reaction and I found out that people come up to me all the time and they say oh I lost my mother I lost my husband and you think oh, yeah, of course. Everyone's grieving. Everyone's grieving this year about something and the older they get the more that happens and and that was never an intention, but I think it I Think people hadn't seen certainly a comedy, but they hadn't seen Something that doubt with grief that man he was just he wanted to die and then I had to make it funny so Yeah, but also his character is dealing with grief not from a religious point of view at all well, I wanted that I wanted a bit of a play on words with afterlife like he thought his life was over and He doesn't really it doesn't even believe in an afterlife. He hasn't even got that comfort so what's the point and and I went down to sort of a nihilist road and I I Wanted to bring him out to say well this to the point. We've still got a few years to enjoy everything else That's the that was the sort of philosophical question So to answer your original question, I think I am quite positive and I think I am quite optimistic I'm an optimistic person. I think it'd be all right, you know, I think it would be all right If there's a meteor heading towards Earth Five billion people are pray to their God and a few hundred scientists to get Bruce Willis up there And you talk about the impact I think again this is true of both of you The impact on people's lives that if you say people after life that's has a resonance with people well I think people want to see things that they haven't seen before and I think this is what happens with Marketing and people who are worried. I think everyone sets out with these good intentions I'm going to do an Uncompromised thing about something they're going to say that it's never been said before and then soon someone says if you take out a couple of the swear words we could put on a nine o'clock if you change that to so-and-so and we might and then soon they've That's it's watered down and it's a you know I remember once I was One of my first things at channel 4 11 o'clock show and I did the sketch it was about there was think about people who claimed benefit when they didn't need it and I played this sort of sort of bigoted crazy right-wing journalist who it would always come down on the wrong side, right and and he was saying my carrot was sort of saying then what you should do is right if if someone you know, um Claims their death set off a fire alarm and see if they run out of the building, right? So it was all that sort of stuff Channel four said can you change that to the blind because the Deaf are very militant So their moral judgment was how many letters they'd have to write also It doesn't work if he's blind because he can hear the fucking Bell. I Wonder why they care about getting letters actually I've often wondered that because that way people think that one one camp now is worse than the worst now now people are terrified of one complaint and now you know how to rap splitting the BBC, you know I've You know talked people down like Executives for saying I'll write the letters. Sometimes they want to know I've explained the joke why it's okay and they're okay never complain I've never had if I were to complain it's never been upheld, you know because if you can if you're clever enough You can it's not just putting stuff out there and trying to offend everyone it's you know You can explain it. Some people just want to be heard. I Were in my normal job people would complain I'd call them back and they go. Oh didn't think you'd call back. They were already happy That you called them back Some people want to be heard because they're never heard and then people are scared I've been playing these days and there's no reason for it but with with afterlife How does it? Feel to to get that feedback from people that it's much more emotional people saying that that touch me that has resonance. It's great It's really good. I feel very proud of that because some it's just I suppose it's just another little layer to it and And I'd certainly rather that than I Hated it. I was offended. You know, I don't I don't want people to hate things how to and be offended I want them to enjoy it. You know, I'm a comedian I'm not a politician or a you know, a religious leader or I put stuff out there cuz I think they'll enjoy it and And pay me And Richard up see your books have had enormous influence on on people's lives. How does that feel? Well, I do very much appreciate getting letters from people who say you've changed my life and I get a a fair number of those I Get an enormous number who say that my books on evolution Decided them to go into science at school and only this week I was seeing a doctor and he and Australian doctor in the hospital and he said At the end. I want to thank you The Selfish Gene was what made me take up Biology and hence made me become a doctor. I love that. I mean that that's really a wonderful wonderful And perhaps more that's more relevant to this meeting The God Delusion enormous numbers of letters from people who say you saved me from my religious upbringing You you you you articulated something that I that I felt myself but could never quite find the words to just to say Myself. I am no longer. I realize free from the shackles of religion and and that I find again hugely gratifying there are many who say There are many who write in great distress because they have lost their faith and are unable to break the news to their parents or their spouse and in particularly poignant are the Clergy people who've there we've got a project in America called the clergy project which is designed to help clergy people clergymen and clergy women who become atheists and can't escape because it's the only living they know and So that's poignant When they when they're they're stuck they can only earn their living by by going on preaching sermons and things like that. So the clergy project Does that and I like to think that maybe I help them as well people who who need to escape? And find it very difficult. I think that's I I think that's really important and it comes back the point we made earlier Ideas not having human rights because I think people think when we criticize religion we're criticizing people who are religious Which is couldn't be further for the truth because we think they're victims too Absolutely. I mean the word Islamophobia is all about that It's a fear it people think that if you criticize Islam you're criticizing Muslims quite the contrary. They're the primary victims of Islam. Well, We are we're almost out of time But just before we finish up here just to turn our attention to the future you have amazing pieces of work Carried out. What? What direction do you see yourself going in the future? downhill Just just seriously, it's just just awful Yeah, I've got a bad back. I wake up. I just like my knees have gone I Don't know. It's what's the point really? I just I Want to be a wet. When when have we got the head in a jar? That's when I that's where I'm on a skateboard me in a jar on a on a hoverboard Whizzing round 200 years old right. I want to do more afterlife. I'm starting filming next week actually afterwards here I'm gonna do follow-up to humanity next year with them super nature So and then I don't know just get drunk Thank you so much for your Sharing insights know anybody isn't about you your work and that the offender being a crooked duck and before I I think My two guests properly there's some other things to be done Which is Simon who is in charge of the this wonderful venue the Troxy here has given us the help the venue Out of here. Oh I Just say I've knocked over a glass of water I'm not see wet myself on stage Absolutely clear. No, okay. Um, we have a real rock and roll death if you electrocute yourself Des pride and Chris French from the skeptic who have organized the event this evening And the Center for inquiry and of course the Richard Dawkins foundation again for our helping to organize and sort out the events But most of all my two wonderful guests it felt like a very special evening I think you'll agree and Congratulations on the award lovely. Thank you very much does the air So we knew Richard Dawkins for fuck's sake Richard will be signing books afterwards, but I think you'll agree a Fantastic and unique evening legend. Please give a huge round of applause for two wonderful guests two amazing people Richard Dawkins Ricky debate Thank you so much. Thank you How did I save me tonight? You""]"

He is a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal Society of Literature.This talk took place at the CSICon 2018 in Las Vegas on October 20, 2018",Center for Inquiry,SYPZwZud_PA,"[""I'm the attorney first CFI and I'm the person privileged to sit here between these two gentlemen and provide a brief introduction before the conversation and I fully appreciate none of you are here to listen to me and so What struck my mind is it's very interesting that you have three English people sat here on the stage in What is quite possibly the least English place? We in England we have Blackpool we have Skegness and you have Atlantic City in Las Vegas And there's an impression that Americans have of the British and the people you think of tends to be it tends to be Churchill and the royal family and then the the cast of Downton Abbey and Benny Hill and are you being served in that? So a Monty Python and that's Britain to you? But Britain etre and Britain and England, they these are countries with a deep history both of science and in the arts It's it's the country of Sir Isaac Newton of Charles Darwin of a Faraday and on the outside It's the country of Shakespeare of the Bronte sisters more money of Stanley Kubrick of the rolling stones of JK Rowling And what we've got here are two of them bought most for most people from our country in those two fields in the field of science and in the field of the Arts on the one hand we have Richard Dawkins, who as you know, the premier evolutionary biologist of his time a science educator Second to none the former Oxford University professor for the public understanding of science The author of such books that have changed lives as The Selfish Gene the blind watchmaker and The God Delusion And then we have Stephen Fry who described earlier and I have never heard a person who fits this better of the Renaissance man The actor on film on TV on stage the author the playwright the radio The quiz show host and if you have not watched Qi Start watching TOI The director of Norwich City Football Club But more than that this is a man who has educated us a man who's educated us in humanism and in humanity who's educated us in history in LGBT rights and those issues in mental health concerns and In the effortless superiority that comes with being English This is wonderful and and I am privileged My mother has said she will never speak to me again because I am sat here between these two gentlemen So I'm gonna pass this over to dr. Dawkins now that phrase effortless superiority Actually, you never it really comes from it comes from Bailey or College Oxford Oh The effortless superiority that marks the Bailey. Oh man well Steven is not a Bailey. Oh, man. I happen to be But um, I did worry a little bit about the same thing Nick was talking about she's got to be a terribly English party and I worry but about that Not only are we both for Oxbridge, but all three of us, I think but Steven and I both went to very similar schools as well. In fact neighbouring schools I was wrongfully word up in these our rival schools and I looked up upping among the web and it's exactly like our depressingly so And you talk about it in your autobiography and brought back horrible memories. Not that I was there, but very similar Memories, but I also got the feeling that you you back on it even though you were expelled You look back on it with a certain nostalgia I do I do and I picked up on a few things that Nick said and you mentioned also about Englishness and yes I am considered by many to be quintessentially English phrase that's often used and and I find it interesting Too of the 20th century's figures of whom you would most use that phrase are probably Winston Churchill and I Christie Who was absolutely typify everything it is to be English and in both cases like me They had foreign parents. They were only half English Churchill was half American as you probably know his mother was an American woman Agatha Christie's father was an American My parent parents my father's very English, but my mother's family was little European Jewish and I think sometimes not belonging to a culture especially one is established and as Naturally replete with its iconography of oak trees and Robin Hood Shakespeare and cricket and castles and royalty and so on but having a family who had embarrassingly foreign and swooped in from Israel and New York bearing presents and doing that thing that no Englishman could possibly abide which is talking about food and The bunch of eat we should eat what you dirty? I don't talk about eating. It's like talking about going to the lavatory You can't possibly do it so I was filled with the embarrassment of the part of me that wanted to be totally English and say, you know pretend my foreign family didn't exist and a Great self-consciousness about what it was to be Asian To move that on to our subject that begins I was sent away to boarding school when I was seven So it was like 200 miles from home which in English terms is the entire length of the country So my parents seemed to send me away very early to go and stay there and the day was marked out by religious services as they are in these schools and then it was in the public school after that again, and and I became immensely interested and immensely moved by the music the architecture the liturgy and everything to do with Religion and I wanted to be a priest an Anglican priest but high Anglican I liked it. I liked the music I liked the smells I liked Ritual I liked the feeling of belonging. I loved everything about it and it got to the stage where I Actually went to see the suffrage and Bishop of Lynne in Norfolk I didn't quite know what to suffer Gunn Bishop is it's one of those words. It's only ever applied to Bishop you never meet a suffrage and teacher or a brain surgeon something but anyway It was a suffragan digit bishop and he chatted to me and when we talked about theology and so on and then and then he asked a question about God and I said, oh, well, that's That's my one problem He said go on I said, you know, I am I never been spoken to by God or spoken to God or have any real sense that there could be such a thing that Because the beauty of the church is it's made by man The anchored Church in particular was constructed in a very short time by Archbishop Cranmer and 10 to the 8th to some extent And I liked it. I liked what it stood for I liked its breath and it's sort of tolerance as a church but the idea of there being a God just struck me as being preposterous and and in my excitement of Fondness for the a merkin Church I had forgotten that really believing in God was still a small in the case of Anglican but necessary part And he advised me to come back when God had spoken to me, and I'm still waiting for But but I I'm really I don't know how you feel about Richard I know you're sometimes accused not knowing enough about religion which is nonsense because I know you do know a lot about the history of Christianity and other religions and and Sometimes people who said to me but you love box masses the you know You love his the b-minor mass You love the you you know that it's in Matthew and this is John you you you love so much. We can't artists you love Mozart's requiem' you know, whatever you love Michelangelo and you love yes Who doesn't but there are number of things you can say about that one is obviously the church was the great employer and the time of the Renaissance and So they had artists had no one else to paint for but the other thing he said that the fact that Religious art can be beautiful doesn't make religion true. For example Without slavery, we would never have had what was called the Negro spiritual or gospel music But I thing that means you have to believe in slavery. It's it's just that sometimes, you know, there are certain ways of Mankind organizing themselves that can that artists will produce great art from and and it is one of those peculiar ideas, I mean after all most of Renaissance art after some 1520's was more likely to be based on Greek mythology and You don't ask whether or not You know whatto and and another office like that believed in Apollo Yes, yes Talking about of Greek mythology, of course, you'll let your latest book I think is on on is Miss awesome and Just register greatly enjoyed it Do you take you don't take more lessons from that? Do you know it's very unlikely top staples is there not Aesop's fables? I absolutely agree. I mean, there's no question. You can look at quite a lot of Greek myth and say that it has tropes what are known in the business is myth Eames, which will be a familiar first form of words to you and Which repeat both within Greek mythology and indeed in other mythologies, but particularly in Greek mythology again And again, you have like the Phaeton myth You know, who was the son of Apollo stroke Helios the Sun God who who demanded of his father it would be an absent father And felt guilty. He demanded that he be allowed to ride the charity of the son And having granted him. Anyway, he couldn't back off and Phaeton gets on the chariot And of course he goes to to near the Sun and the the earth freezes at the poles He plunges too deep and the the deserts get formed as he burns the earth and eventually Zeus sees that he's destroying the planet by moving the Sun up and done and and he Thunderbolt him out of existence and and You probably know the story of Icarus, too of course the son of dangerous the inventor who made the wings In the he told his son Icarus that he mustn't go too near the sea or you know the wingtips will be caught in and be made sodden and waterlogged and he'd be drowned or he mustn't fly too close to this because Because the the feathers were held on with wax which would melt and he would plummet and of course he plummeted And there are there are lots of Greek myths along those lines, which if you exhibit what you might call hubris a people overstretching indeed that the Greek for stretching too far is detainees and the Titans were the race of the sort of second race of Divine beings the Titans stretched too far and and the Greeks I think were aware that they were the first civilization through all kinds of accidents including the arrival of the alphabet and and you know Richly linear B. And then the Greek alphabet they were the first nation to believe in progress to believe that as it were a father should outdo a son a child should outdo a parent and And that's why I think Greek myths full of things like Phaeton And the the young trying to fly too close to the Sun because the Greeks had as an example Egypt you they looked across the Mediterranean and for three and a half thousand years the Egyptians hadn't invented anything new three and a half thousand years and Extremely prosperous civilization had basically stayed the same as had other Civilizations as far as we know around the world. They had established themselves. This is how we build a pylon This is how we do a lintel and entablature. This is how we worship. This is how we move food about that's it Mm-hmm. We now have a viable life and it could last for four thousand years but the Greeks with incredible speed changed everything change the way they ran their politics into deems or or city-states Changed the way they used voting and and change the way they had juries and a justice system mathematics and algebra and logic even Pythagorean rules about music and harmony all these things appeared at incredible speed and the arrival of a literature and and and It was best but by Browning I think Summing up. This Greek is stretching out. This constant feeling that there is more you can discover more it's all there to be discovered and Ignores, this is word for that they discover from within their own experience as human beings and through experiment with the world and Browning as browning put it that a man's reach should exceed his grasp or what's a heaven for? And I think Plato and the Greeks understood the idea of heaven, although they talked about God in heaven They knew them exactly as a model as an idea There is an ideal to which we strive and the Greeks are constantly striving towards something better. They don't believe you know that as Simon Raven the novelist put it the genius of the Greeks lay in this understanding of eschatology of you know, the idea of a life after death and It was put by sinon I think the Greek who said any single person who tells you that they know what happens to a human being After they have died is either a liar or a fool simple an obvious thing to say, but the Greeks had that and it's mysterious to us because We tribally and for hundreds of years almost thousand and a half years Struggled to have such a simple honest open idea anybody who tells you what happens after you die. It's hotter or alive read Stephen I've read you saying somewhere that we must believe there is no life after death Oh, yes And and because we we really live a very bad life unless we do believe It because if we think we this is this is just a preparation. Yes. Yeah I remember being shocked before he shocked us for other reasons by Mel Gibson Well, I know But he was being interviewed this is in the 80s at the very height of his young stardom when he was the coolest man on the planet virtually and I had no idea that he was belonged to this particularly severe Catholic section in Australia that his father was there was a member of But with the interview said, I believe I've read somewhere Mel that you're You you believe in life after death and in and Mel Gibson said well I know I know one thing for a fact There's got to be more to it than this What What even if you were just an ordinary guy? To say oh, yeah, this is America Australia this Europe. There's the Lake District. There's the poles there's the deserts There's the tropics. There's the bushes this if the galaxy there are units but there's gotta be more than that surely but not only that you are a star who can have as much sex as you can eat and and as much money as you could possibly demand and you feel it's somehow not enough, you know, and this idea that Of course we're all kinds of obvious ways of knowing that religion, you know uses Uses the afterlife and the threat of something better as a way of allowing people Forcing people to put up with what they've got But yes, I do believe that even on its own terms if you believe in an afterlife its limits this life You know you've got to as Oscar Wilde said try the fruit of every tree of every orchard in the world and some will be bitter and some will be a too addictive and And so on but but if you and and so I often say to religious people I said, you know It would say well suppose, you know a Calvinist Appears of the gates of heaven and some Peter says so what did you make of them? Cannabis sativa, the the plant there. Oh, I never tried that. No, no The idea how much effort went into making this very special plant I'm not saying you should have nothing, but but you didn't even try it What about wine or no, no no wine touch my lips you fucker do you know Do you know how complex the grape is unique of all fruits? You don't have to add sugar For it to turn into this remarkable and you didn't even bother to try it that's such an extraordinary idea I mean now, you know Pete you should on your deathbed you should be going damn it I I never drank milk from the armpits of a Nepalese virgin or whatever it is I never I don't know that wouldn't be my particular one that some people You know, I never climbed Kilimanjaro. I never you know, there's so much. That's so beautiful I Once asked the professor of ancient history at Oxford whether the Greeks really believed in their gods and to my surprise, he said yes Definitely did it's very interesting. I mean there's The the gods are so colored. I mean the twelve Olympian gods and there were many others I think they used the names of primal gods that had no personality and they did believe in them as abstract words Aristotle uses them a lot the Greek words for necessity cause and blame for example necessity Ananka is very strong idea in Greek philosophy and Morris Doom The ones do and literally means it's not a word you use in English, but it used to be used portion What is allotted to you? Yeah And they were the first we know of again because of their first to have writing But to go and very sophisticated ways into the question of free will Which is a very hot issue at the moment as you probably know very few philosophers now all scientists believe there is such a thing as free well and they kind of don't speak about it because it's been embarrassing because if you have to explain to people that that doesn't mean that there's no such thing as Responsibility and it doesn't mean that we don't try and live a good virtuous life According to our lights and so on but that it's a sort of intellectual point about being fairly clear There is no such thing as free well or as shop and how poor did we we we can we'll what we do But we can't will what we will there's a very important point and the Greeks were very interested in that and so they they had this idea of fate and necessity Europe your portion which they gave a kind of divine permanence that these were things that were there that were Outside our control and I think most of human history And most of myth and religion is a has been a question of refining Our understanding of things we can't control so when our ancestors were really were alone and without any Building or farming yet as being an idea We were hunter-gatherers as the Frazee's Their children looked at the mothers and fathers and they said why does what is it that pushes leaves out of trees? It's something that's beyond our control. I know if I pick a stone up The stone is picked up, but how it what is the power behind the leaf coming out of a tree happens every year? What is this fire that comes out of a mountain? What is the water that drops out of the sky? These are things over which we have no control. And so it's very natural that our ancestors gave them personality It's the first thing we do it's it's it's as much art and literature as it is religion to to to make a story out of these forces And so you you you name a god of the mountain that roars fire? You name a god of the clouds? And the Thunder and you have a God of nature and of growth and the harvest and and one of decay and you make rituals Out of it and well, then slowly you begin to understand them and each one that you understand the God disappears But this is what enemies do and them and I I get that but To believe that Zeus turned himself into an eagle in order to oh, I don't I I don't think Aristotle Plato believed Oh, I'm sure they didn't but did the ordinary Athenian in the street believe that and I suspect not but I don't think they did. I think they they Conveniently said much as we you know much as children's fairy stories do that. There was a time when men and women walked with pixies and fairies we say, you know and there was a time when men and women consorted with gods the Greek said when the gods would cut gods would come down in the form of an eagle or Whatever or they would turn human beings into flowers And a lot of these etiological myths there misdescribed to describe the causes of things and and and some of them are some of them have profound insight and some of them are just sweet stories like for example when Zeus and Hera got married Zeus had said that any any any One who or anything any creature that could come up with the best food for the for the wedding? Would be granted a wish and so you imagined this kind of Gordon Ramsay situation on these You know TV chef things were all these trestle tables and all these double, you know a young Haran had created a little sort of jelly for them to eat and they try that and then all the other animals and they come to this tiny little pot and Hiro Tasted this is delicious and Zeus tasted. So this is very good What is it in the little creature called Melissa who has made it says there if you please I've made this It's a very special process I've invented I go from flower to flower and I collect all the little bits of nectar, and I then put them together But it takes a huge amount of effort. But anyway, I've made this pot of it I call it honey and Zeus in here and say well you've won the prize. There's no question named your wish and Melissa says well, it takes so much effort and Days and days and days to make the smallest amount of my honey And and one swipe of a Foxy's Pour and one lick of a bear's tongue and all my work can be undone And you've given the scorpion a weapon and the snake of venomous bite, but I don't have any weapon So, can you give me a fatal sting so that anyone who tries to? steal steal my honey its fatal and Zeus is furious and there's a bit sound of thunder because he thinks it's such a selfish Wish this is very well says you will have a fatal sting. She squeaks in triumph fizzes, but but it will be fatal to you and as you know a wasp can sting as many times as it likes them but but a But a bee sting is barbed a honey bee sting which is melissa is honey Bee, of course And and and so they have to pull her and guts out after they've stung you and they kill themselves and that was uses punishment for her selfishness But pleasingly as Richard will know the the order of 2 which bees and wasps belong is known as Hymenoptera - - entomologists which means wedding wings Anyway, so that's just a sweet story. That's the typical mythic story But then there are I think profound insights. So I'm sure you've all heard of the muses the nine sisters who lived in And who represented each one of them one of the arts? Chapstick or a for dance and clear victory and so on and so forth But what's so interesting is that their mother my father was used of course because he was properly bit with his seed but their mother was one of the original Titan s is one of the first twelve of the Titans whose name is Mnemosyne a Man named Watson. Hey, that's difficult word to say and it simply the Greek word for memory as in mnemonic and So there the Greeks are saying there what Joseph Campbell would he called myths? He called them public dreams Which I think is a rather brother, you know, you called them the collective unconscious but whatever it is Whether it's the public dream of the Greek people or their collective unconscious They said the arts are all daughters of memory. And I think that is extremely true It's a compressed poetic idea that artists reassemble Put back together again learned experience felt emotions truthful recall of what it is to be alive and that therefore all artists are summoning that memory muses are the daughters of memory and that's an accident if you like of the beauty of human culture that a people can come up with a myth a way of Personifying I complex ideas abstract ideas, but let me ask about this I've always been fascinated by where they come from. It's it's as though we believe that somehow these things emerge from you coordinate or fight yearly and collective unconscious or but Somebody must actually have sat down and made it up in the first place. Just emerge You have a jokes, isn't it? Where did the joke? Told that joke and the campfire or something some read means one assumes around a fire. Yes. I have a I I'm because of one of my greatest is language as well. I think it's very I think it's you know, it's Clear that around a fire You know, it's cold there are animals wolves are howling and the children that can't get sleep and Full tummies and you want to tell stories and everything's mysterious and as I say you want to explain things the Greeks had this advantage that oh, No other myths up until that time and many after didn't have and that is as I say they had they had settled down as a people as the Doric people Iommi and people the various different people of the of the of the of the peninsula of Greece and so on and writing had arrived so Hesiod and Homer were able to put down and so you could have pedigrees and family histories and Chronologies of the gods which had never happened before but who first came up with them and their names? Well, you can be You know, you can be sure that they all came from further east They follow the development of mankind and civilization as we currently understand it which as you know Really seem to spring up in what they call the Fertile Crescent the Greek for between rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates and the Greek for between rivers is Mesopotamia so it's that area that what is now Iraq? huge irony being the very place where Isis has pulled down so many of those archaeological reminders of where Mankind first started to civilize itself in as much as we ever have I to settle and have roots and cities so on and and that that's where it began the first of those gods as far as we can tell they then moved west from tyre and the Lebanon The Cadmus myth which comes from the beginning of the alphabet comes from there was the Phoenicians It was Cadmus his brother, Phoenix Who had founded the Phoenician Empire and it's I know I mean, you know You will never really know because so much that we need to know comes before writing or even carving it But we can guess let's move to the modern world now you've said in defense of the royal family and Surprisingly you've Met said that you're a monarchist of a sword over and one of the points you made was that well, there's a queen has no power Officially, it's somehow good for the Prime Minister. They have to go every week. Yeah, and as it were explained herself To the monitor and if only Trump had to go to Uncle Sam, yeah, that's right Exactly. I I did I wrote an op-ed for the New York Times Which I said exactly that a couple of fourth of July ago I said you know if there if Uncle Sam was a living person this embodiment of The US and it only occurred to me when I was writing the article that Uncle Sam his initials were u.s.a did so obvious So there with his bony knees and his wispy beard and his stripy top hat and in his waistcoat with the stripes and the stars and everything all over it and and He is an embodiment a personification of what America is supposed to be Barely a real human being at all more an idea and that's what a queen is That's what a monarchy is not I mean, of course somewhere there's some real DNA real person who sits on a laboratory and all the rest of it but the Queen as far as we're concerned is an image in imago a Sort of you know a Constant a constant embodiment of an idea not a not a person and that's why when people meet Queen Anne actually a great friends of this festival and of the great amazing Randi are Penn Jillette and Teller you know Penn & Teller who kind of earned this town as magicians and great skeptics and rationalists and I was Emceeing of this is literally 20 years ago now Because I'm doing the same thing in three days time with for his 70th birthday But it was the 50th birthday of the Prince of Wales and I was M seeing the show we did at the London Palladium and Penn & Teller did some magic at it and After that curtain came down The Penn was next to me said oh no what happens now? We've got to meet the princess up right? That's it Yeah, he just comes along So later everybody and pen doctor said well, I gotta call me your majesty I said well no, he's not the monarch you technically it would be your royal highness if you wanted to come anything But don't bother just I haven't called you pen once since we've been chatting in the last day and you don't call people by their Name do you Nick do you Richard? You know, it's so just don't bother don't think about it good and do I have to bow because I'm American we don't bow He knows you're American he's heard your voice you may not know that l is American so doesn't speak but he knows you're American Honestly, it's fine. Well, I'm gonna get put in the Tower of London Oh for heaven's sake I assure you it's fine Anyway, Prince was in love. Did you see? Oh, how do you do? Thank you for coming do appreciate it He gets to Penn who fools your royal majesty Highness The Prince looks a little baffled, but he's used to it. It happens all the time he moves along and again and then of course Penton Smith said I betrayed my country Why did how do what power do they have And it is that power that exists and it's not the same as a pretend religious thing It's something we understand in minor ways we know what the power of a brand is in court in the corporate world and and in a much more concentrated an extraordinary an almost mystical way the power of a brand like a monarch is such that I have seen people who are furiously Anti-monarchist II who in the presence of the cream will melt slightly and if president Trump were not the head of state But were the servant of his people like a prime minister who? has a head of state who would be Uncle Sam and if light the Prime Minister has to every single week come what may Prime Minister has to go to back in Palace and have an audience with the Queen You'll probably remember if you ever saw the series the crown When the cream first ascended to the throne her first Prime Minister having to be Winston Churchill who had to come in to her presence And stand an old man, not that physically well Stand in her presence and explain himself to this young girl Who was the symbol of her country and she took the mantle on and she's been doing it ever since? Now if Trump had to do that had to go to some colonial mansion on the hill Where this this figure our Uncle Sam was well now well now young young young. Mr. Trump. What have you been doing this week? And And Trump had to bow his head and he's bowing He said not because he believes in monarchy or some trumped-up nonsense to do with the divinity of Kings But because he is the basing himself in front of the idea of the country He is there to serve. I think that's mentally helpful. And that's where I think myth ritual and ceremony Have real place as long as you know what they are because if you actually believed as a god or you know If you you know, as long as you understand that the most it's the Wizard of Oz operating the levers but then nonetheless the power it has over us is it we are you know as evolutionary Biology and and and so which is is, you know a hugely growing field we're beginning to understand a little more about how he evolved in terms of our feelings as well as our cognition and I'm sure many of you have read some of the popular books that have been around in the last dozen years dealing with the subject of our that the contingency of our understanding of anything at exactly the time when the world is disintegrating and the Power of the UN or the EU or other groups, however, flawed to bring people together Everyone's being propelled against and even today I noticed Trump has got rid of the 1986 or 87 is it? strategic arms Treaty with Russia. He just announced today. He's he's Terminating it. He said so as all of this happens and as Less and less Authority and understanding of our in the world happens. We are beginning to understand how little we actually know so that while Skeptics and rationalists are very keen to remind people of how we should always examine the truth and look at the truth We are the first to understand thanks to Daniel Kahneman and thanks to various others how little we know and how how how much our cognition and how much our understanding is colored and changed is Transmogrified by both what we wish and what we have experienced what our body expects us to feel or our eyes expect us to see and and we can't necessarily trust in in in everything but That's an excitement. That doesn't mean we give up trying to know things It means we try even harder to realize how you know, just how How our emotions have a huge part to play in everything we do we are immensely Emotional and being skeptical and being rational is not denying that it's understanding it it's understanding the the part emotions have to play and and ritual and ceremony and Metaphor and symbol which are the substance of art and so on Also the substance of a lot of ways humans behave. I mean, even you the comedy of me not knowing who was to take the The the award that I was given I I almost wanted to say well the one thing the church gets right is they rehearse? The bishop the bishop has told the old world we don't know what he's told the older boy But You know, there's a way you hold it here. You put it down here This goes here and and I'm sure many humanists in the room have have come across this issue of where we find the poetry and the Romance the ritual the glamour That the church has over the over hundreds of years has managed to find in order to send people away from the world and yet to come to a really good humanists funeral or wedding and some of them I was asked by a friend a concert pianist to To be the humanist preacher as it were his wedding and I did my best and one can raid and ransack the larder of of poetry and music that exists without having to adduce a creator for someone's wedding or someone's funeral but But we should learn from the fact that the church's obviously I was not present of that weddings deal But I absolutely know you did it a lot better than any Or suffered in Bishop. I Mean and I think they disagree with you about funerals, too I've been to a number of humanist funerals and they've work well have a no question about it The religious ones are not tailored to the individual they are a formula an algorithm Which is in the Book of Common Prayer and they just read out as though it was anybody The humanist ones are about the person who's died. Yes, the person who's died their favorite poetry that they read music You got eulogies Speaking about them. There's so much more is drooling I'm see writing and tailoring it and being personal rather than as you say being a being general but on the other hand this it's a good mixture because If you are married in a traditional service and you get a really dramatic Vicar or bishop and they say after the bride and groom have kissed those whom God hath joined Let no man put asunder. Yes, you think wow, that's good. That is good there You know, you really ought similarly ashes to ashes dust to dust. Yes, I think Wow I am joining in with my community in that. Yeah, that's good. But there are a few good phrases that you have gotta admit They came out Good, but we can we can match them. Yeah Shakespeare or week we can do it, but it's also it's a bit cultural You know, I I just just suddenly remembered. I was doing a filming in northern Spain and they have this amazing tradition the Basque the the chakra where the the the men cook and And and they had these male cooking clubs and all the wives and families and friends come and and the men do this Feeling outside often or if it's in winter inside and we were invited to this and it was astonishing to see And a great thing to be a part of and when it finished people got up and started singing Basque songs and there were about seven of us have English on from in the film David Suchet used to be played Poirot so successfully he was playing the Polian I was playing Wellington and there were a few of us and they turned to us and said to Sing now We thought we're gonna sing we're gonna sing we all live in a yellow submarine they've been seeing these basque songs of the mountains that are 300 years old and I said I don't know any English songs apart from pop songs I mean there is sort of early one morning just as the Sun was rising. There are few and maybe that's the problem maybe the problem with being English and Empire and everything like that is that we have no culture of our own we've just stolen so many has the world's worst national anthem Yeah, we do have pretty grog pretty grim one of those do we yeah you've said Stephen that The catastrophe of Trump and brexit is more less a triumph of the right as a failure of the left. Yes Do you recognize the phrase regressive left which I think was coined by Margit know else? Yes. I've come across it. Yeah Yeah, you have a view on that I am That there's a part of me that just wants to be mischievous and say look, you know This Grand Canyon close to where we are. Now, this Grand Canyon is opened up in America and really across the World and certainly the developed world did the chattering world if you like And it's getting wider every day and therefore P on each side of the divide they have to shout louder and gesticulate more horribly to be heard by the other side and they're not being heard by the other side and they're just making noises and screaming and hating each other deeply and thinking the other vile and and destructive and inhuman and I like to think of myself and Right-thinking people as cowering in the ravine at the bottom Unsure what to do because on the one hand you have a nativist alt right? Bringing up all kinds of nasty and unacceptable and horrifying racist thoughts and divisions, but also you have a preposterous a liberal liberal left shouting out these jargon istic and nonsense from the universities if I have to hear about the patriarchy and cisgendered white privilege Again, I did it, you know My heart has always been with the left and that makes it all the more difficult for me to think that I just cannot And I want this is at the heart of I think all we talk about being English too dramatic Spurn JK Rowling and Isaac Newton everything the one thing they all have in common is empiricism. It's not about Knowing anything. It's not about having a point of view, which is your Strict view of things. It's about finding out experimenting and trying things out and seeing what works and I think the left has a terrible problem in rhetoric and expresses itself in a way that is Precisely, it seems designed to alienate even soft right people even ordinary Republicans who? are Maddened by what they see is the nonsense of political correctness Most left people are not you know, prey to it. But unfortunately that mouthpieces on either side are so loud And you're supposed to take a stand. I'm supposed to be on one side or the other. Well, I I just Repudiate that I wouldn't be on either side. Neither means anything to me and and so we have to run I Was thinking a lot about my friend Christopher Hitchens whose spirit is occasions like this, of course It was much stronger than I was and his great hero As a political writer and thinker was George Orwell who was much stronger and more forceful about these things than as Christopher was more strong and more forceful about these things than I am. My hero really was probably em4 Stowe's better known as a novelist but as an essayist, he had a lot to say and His attitude it's probably best summed up by one of his essays which is called two cheers for democracy he was I can't quite bring myself to Sound three. Cheers He said but two cheers is about right and he and his friend Bertrand Russell and the mayor made the point about how we live in the world that Those who are stupider are so full of certainty and and those who are wise are so unsure a WB Yeats would put it most famously in the you know, the ceremony of innocence is drowned and The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity. Well, not home The center will not hold exactly and that's the problem being in the center, which will not hold the best Which you hope you're part of the best lack all conviction. We're not certain. We're not convinced We're not sure how the world should go forward But we see we recognize ugliness when we see it And graceless honest and unkindness and brute force and and clamouring kind of binary tearing away of everything so that you know this constant you're either with us or against us attitude and and the stuck here in the middle People say well, you know That's all very well. But that's you just being a liberal You know Squashy soft, you know, there are people dying out there They'll say you know, and yes, there are and one does you know? Look at the row hinges being massacred in and Disrupted and destroyed in Burma and and and look at you know Look at what's going on in them or all over the Yemen and Syria and places like that There's all kinds of terrible things happening But I don't I don't hear the the regressive left or the liberal liberals as I gone all the right making any fuss about that and and I I'm Desperate to know what to think I really am unsure because part of me says yes, of course all my life I fought for gay rights I fought for you know, I thought for to listen To sighs even fought at all. I've sat at a desk and tapped into keyboard Done the odd interview on the subject of gay rights, so I haven't fought at all But I have at least expressed an opinion and and and you know My heart is with you know with with people being given a fair shake of the source bottle as australians put it You know and a fair shake is it seems to be good? But we now Aren't allowed really much room for conversations of any nuance or any any doubt you have to be on one side or the other and and the world I'm convinced of it America certainly Britain and Europe are crying out for something in between and unfortunately what we've had in between in the past and it's too recent to be Forgotten in America is Bill Clinton. And in Britain was Tony Blair Both of them very impressive people in terms of their grasp of history And the mechanics and process of power and all the rest of it, but who are slightly kind of I? know disreputable in our eyes in case Britain in the case of Blair because he took us into an Iraq war which most of us think is a mistake The case of Clinton all kinds of reasons have to do with his own behavior as well And so that third way that they represented a very self-conscious Third Way is its treated with suspicion My feeling is that a true satirist and some of a true insider Jonathan Swift would actually be saying to you all and I should be saying to myself Don't look to blame politicians don't look to blame the the slogan ears on either side of the culture wars. It's not their fault It's your fault We are the ones who say oh Look at politicians. They're always just disagreeing with each other and then the moment there's a third way politician You say well, they're all the same Well mark, you can have it both ways. Do you want them all the same or do you want them all different? It's actually you are the problem you and I are the problem We want to drive around in cars and we want a green clean world where you can't have both You can't square that circle there are lots and lots of circles that can't be squared in squares that can't be circled but we lay off all our guilt or our own self discussed at our greed and our rapacity as Creatures on this earth we lay off that burden on Politicians who we pay to take our disgusting filth. That should be ended us And before we finish up and move over to the book signing there was one question I wanted just would address to both of you on this and and yesterday unfortunately You were stuck somewhere on Delta When we heard Steven Pinker speak and very optimistic that we are, you know The world is getting wealthier poverty is going down Malnutrition is going down The the economy is moving forward yet on the other hand we see Not just the political catastrophes that are happening, but also the potential environmental disasters that the UN is talking of Unfolding are you both both short-term and long-term. Are you optimistic? Are you pessimistic? Where are we going as a world? well Steven Pinker and Matt Ridley both my friends are sort of the - optimists in the world at the moment And They make they both make a persuasive case that Science can do all sorts of things and we may be in trouble in all sorts of ways but science will will find a way And if you look at the broad sweep of history things are getting better. I desperately want to believe them I Would like to try to put the optimistic case say we we are in a temporary Reversal at the moment things are not going. Well at the moment. These are going extremely badly at the moment both in Britain and America But if you do take the long view of history III think it's possible to be optimistic. So Unrealistic as it sounds I'm gonna sort of slightly set aside with Pinker and Ridley. Yeah. That's very good I agree with you Richard and I think you know a lot of Human progress has been three steps forward to back or two steps forward one back whatever, but it has been forward but this may be a step back moment where things are bad, but I think there's a lot to Think about I do some work occasionally for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation who are particularly strong on the SDGs as they're called the sustainable Development goals now is one of these dull bureaucratic phrases that it began with the Millennial goals in the year 2000 where all the countries the United Nations signed up to certain aims and these were refined in the year 2010 Into these sustainable goals 27 of them a lot to do with the female education, for example And things that people know will transform the way that the the poorest and the most disease ridden in the world those with the fewest Opportunities in the world that can most be taken out of poverty and the results there have been a standing I mean truly amazing in that period 2002 now which many people think of as the post 9/11 period the period of fear of terrorism and and so on which of course it has been but in that period 66 66 percent greater increase in women having education around the world 66% 2/3. I mean that's pretty astonishing and the results against HIV and and even the You know More resistive strains of TB and other diseases these are being controlled in ways That would have seemed impossible 15 years ago. And so in that respect things are going very well but I would agree the threat to the to the climate into the world that's being offered is it's a desperate while and also as I said that lunch today and all this is ignoring the technological transformations that are coming in the next 20 or 30 years with AI and biotech and by augmentation and Gene editing and stem cell work and I mean There's so much of it each one of these technologies on its own would be transformative But together they represent what I call it tsunami that is approaching us and a lot of that will be helpful to health Extraordinarily helpful to health will create great economies of scale the data Which become the new currency rather than petrol or the dollar data is the currency will allow all kinds of medical advances I'm convinced and I hope a more rational view of You know genetic modification of crops will allow for the immense promise they offer people are very superstitious about them as if there's a monstrous as if they're new even so I think there are all kinds of scientific possibilities that will help but I We just have to be alert and it's this is what you know, skepticism really means alertness being alive to an idea That's seeing an idea as a living thing and and in honor of my rival University Oxford For which you both come and it's a carriage man that as a great admirer of Oscar Wilde I will and just by quoting and I think this is what conventions like this do and should foster and When Oscar wrote his letter to to his old lover Posey from prison it's called De Profundis from the depths and he accuses him of a lot of betrayals and things but he's also very Complimentary to him but he says when you were at Oxford you didn't get a degree That's perfectly understandable. Many fine brains have never managed to get their degree But what I find inexcusable is that you never acquired what used to be called The Oxford manner said I know that sounds a terrible phrase But I take to mean this the ability to play gracefully with ideas Is that a wonderful thing the ability to play gracefully with ideas and I think it's very important that the skeptical rationalist a secularist atheist movement remembers to be graceful Remembers that playing with these ideas is what enlightens us Individually and fulfills us as humans as well as fulfilling I hope much more of the of the public culture that you know The understanding that ideas are to be embraced and hugged and played with and licked Enjoyed and have the juice sucked out of them and you know that there's pleasure in this it's not an earnest endeavor It's not a grim piece of work. It's it's an excitement And I think that's that will that will ensure the better future being alert and playing gracefully with ideas Thanks for watching if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends Don't forget to subscribe to the channel and ring that bell to be notified about new videos You can follow us on social media And if you really love what we do consider supporting us with a donation links to all that good stuff is in the description below""]"

banister company it's actually my half-brother Fabio's company it's give me 60 quid and all we have to do is do a little little bit of advertisement me to it up [Laughter] once went to see the film shame with these dad but said the graphic sex made it very awkward everyone in the cinema asked them to stop my dad first time on the show you can be better on the numbers or the letters I think it's

we would come in and put on the twenty five pounds the would service have a device and that vote would cover you for the year so your initial Carlisle charge would be covered under that 25 pound I didn't know you were going to ask me about that inferno we're in this ridiculous sure naked women on it I look like a flying helicopter named Barbie there's a woman by the bundle with a legs akimbo don't we'd be discussing going door-to-door all let's move on that was a bit quiet all I'm saying and I'll stand by my point [Laughter] [Applause] okay time to go across once again to dictionary corner Graig what have you got for us when I was an educator as I was for many years I was fortunate enough that there was a guest speaker at the school I taught at and it was the X champion boxer chris eubank he very kindly came in for nothing to inspire the children and he did three and a half hour lecture to them it was unusual and it consisted of him telling some loot anecdotes but he interspersed and was very aggressive poems shouted into the children's faces you know it was really inspiring anyway I realized afterwards I didn't think I could do impressions I've never been out to do impressions but I can do an incredible impression of Chris Eubank because he inspired me that day I've realized that classic works of literature sound better through Eubanks voice what a treat for us all I thought I'd present some to you and before I do I'll tell you that my agent and every member of production I've spoken to on this show has made it very clear they think this is a terrible idea [Laughter] after jumping on people I said I have to I take a wife I take a while to get Chris's boy so bear with me after you [Applause] culture please that was the age of wisdom what the age of foolishness thank you I mean something is it's actually a very good Nelson Mandela shall I compare thee to a summers day my lovely and more temperate rough winds just to compare America he wouldn't be offended you know okay say pugilist the few times that see that Zack cuts mean that's his keyword I wasn't a fighter I was up here jealous you're talking to me you're talking to I know what you're

bit of choosing the letters and the numbers down so what about 8 out of 10 cats does countdown plays darts so introduced a darts element in to count them so the idea would be instead of playing a

me said you were the first and it's quite a bit of publicity so I just went yeah I went along with it for years yeah and then it became the truth that's how history is written I did a best man speech

lot of parking fines and I have realized if you ask for evidence then often you can get out of the fine now I was up north doing a show and I got to find so I emailed the council asking for the evidence I got an email from some woman called Steph they said mr. lacet I have passed your email on to the freedom of information team hopefully they'll be in touch with you soon now I didn't like that word hopefully so I retired Steph sadly hopefully doth butter no parsnips can I have an email address for the person you have contacted my lawyers would like to contact them directly you have been very helpful and hopefully you won't get caught up in the forthcoming forthcoming with sinister enough mr. nice I'm not sure what you mean about butter past ICC didn't the FOI team who will advise now I got an email from someone called Colin they said mr. lacet your request is very broad so I've assumed you only want information person into your recent parking vine attached is the evidence which we have which are photographs of your car clearly Park syntax right now the photographs they had are of my window which has taxi rank written on it by presumably a disgruntled taxi driver there's actually no evidence of a taxi rank in that photograph so I went back to Colin didn't I mr. Colin when you assume you make an ass out of you and me I see that your evidence is nothing more than a picture of the words taxi rank written on my car I would argue this evidence is insufficient I also put PS apologies for the delay and replying to your previous email I'm currently on the Costa del Sol I provided evidence of this and then I just put this picture [Laughter] I said mister Lysa in order to reverse the find you will need to provide evidence that your vehicle was not in a taxi rank so I said all mr.

Putin since you've been in Russia well I don't think it really has changed because the question might presume that I had a positive opinion at some point I think everyone would agree probably including the Russian President himself that he is an authoritarian leader I think the Russian government broadly does not have a good record on human rights and that hasn't changed how odd is it to you that while you've been there consensus here has hardened that they are the actors who interfered in our last presidential election I don't think that's especially surprising there was a story published in The New York Times actually reporting on a study in February of 2018 and was also done in the Washington Post a few months prior to that about the record of electoral interference and they looked at the history of Russia and the Soviet Union and an electoral Intel interference by intelligence agencies and they found I think 36 different cases of electoral interference over roughly the past 50 years but then they also looked at the United States intelligence services and found that we hit enter feared in foreign elections eighty-one different times now this is not to say one is better than the other it's not about that it's about budget about capability but we do what we do see from this is that what happened in 2016 actually was not unusual from the perspective of intelligence agencies this is what they believe are they are hired to do what we have to do is find out how to secure our systems against the attacks that we know are inevitable something you've been asked before something you have answered before but since this is a fresh occasion we'll will ask it again why not stay in this country and face the music if you believed in the strength of your conviction this is a great question Brian and I'm glad you asked it when we say face the music the question is well what song are they playing I was intentionally charged as every major whistleblower in the last decades has been with the very particular crime this is a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917 and and this is a law that is explicitly designed to prohibit a meaningful defense in court this is applied or this law is used against people who's the only thing that they've done and this is by the government's own terms the only thing the government accuses people defending themselves against this charge I have done is that they have told something to a journalist that the government considers classified that is the whole of the crime they don't consider whether it was good or bad they don't consider whether or not it caused harm simply did you tell something classified to a journalist if you did the jury is not allowed to consider and in fact they're explicitly forbidden from considering why you told journalists they're explicitly forbidden from considering did it result in a public benefit right did it further the public interest instead they simply say did you tell a journalist let the glass buy so I am NOT if I had stayed in the United States and my good friend Daniel Ellsberg by the way that has told me that I was right not to stand and wait for an inevitable arrest because the laws and the way they're enforced today is not the same as the 1970s when he came forward with the Pentagon Papers I would not have received a fair trial there would not have been much of a trial at all I would only have received a sentencing and the question there is what message does that send whether you like me or not I could be the best person in the world I could be the worst what message does a conviction where you spend the rest of your life in prison for telling journalists things that change the laws of the United States that have resulted in the most substantive reform so intelligence authorities since the 1970s if the only result of doing that is a life sentence in prison the next person who sees something criminal happening in the United States government will be discouraged from coming forward and I can't be a part of that where do your parents come down on what you did in the book we learn a lot more than we knew about them they were both we say this in quotes deep Staters we learn that they both had varying degrees of security clearances in their lives yeah I come from a federal family my father worked for the military my mother works for the courts my whole line going back has worked in the in the government service so I think this was difficult for them and in fact one of the things that I will be eternally grateful for is the fact that they still stand by me today and believe that I did the right thing were they present for your wedding you've gone and gotten married in the years since we've last spoken there hasn't been a wedding yet actually we were married but it was just a paperwork sighs in a courthouse because Lindsay and I had been living together we had been in love with each other we had been in a relationship for more than ten years there will be a wedding someday Brian and I hope you'll be there what do you make of Donald Trump there are so many things that are said about the president right now and so much thinking and honestly I try not to think about it there's so much chaos and there are so many aggressive and offensive things said I think even his supporters would would grant that but I think he's actually quite simple to understand Donald Trump strikes me like nothing so much as a man who has never really known a love that he hasn't had to pay for and so everything that he does is informed by a kind of transactional ism I think and what he is actually looking for is simply for people to like him unfortunately that produces a lot of negative effects do you believe he is a threat to national security I mean this is the question of who defines national security what is national security when we used to talk about national security we thought about public safety but now national security really means the security of the system itself the institution of government and I think he's made it his stated goal to change the way that system works I think we have seen tremendous harm done to civil liberties in the United States increasingly since September 11th and I haven't seen any reduction in the rate of that we have several important jobs vacant in this country including director of national security national security advisor is that a threat to our security I think it really says something about where we are what this point in our history looks like when we find that there are not enough people in the country that are willing not to serve in the White House and qualify to serve in the White House who all sides of the government feel comfortable working with and who they can back we are in a time that is increasingly fractured and I think that's a product of the fact that look if you look around at the world right now when you look at news when you look at news coverage when you look at every controversy that we see something has changed and that is that it has become increasingly popular for your feelings to matter more than the facts and I think that's toxic to a democracy because if there's one thing that we have to have to be able to have this discussion to be able to learn to live with people that we disagree with we can't have a conversation about what we should do we can't have a conversation about where we are going if we can't agree on where we are if we can't agree on what is happening facts have to matter more than the feelings you've said your greatest fear over what you did was that things would not change have things changed would you do it again today knowing what you know now this is a significant portion of the the final chapter of my book things have changed and I would do it again if I changed anything I would hope that I could have come forward sooner it took me so long just to understand what was happening and it took so long not to realize that nobody else was going to fix this believe me when I say I did not want to light a match and burn my life to the ground no one does nobody really wants to be a whistleblower but the results of that have been staggering I thought this was gonna be two days story I thought everybody was gonna forget about this a week after the journalist ran the first stories in 2013 but here we are in 2019 and we're still talking about it in fact data security surveillance the internet manipulation and influence that's provided or produced rather by a corporate or governmental control of this permanent record of all of our private lives that's been created every day by the devices that we have before 2013 if you said there's a system that's watching everything you do the government is collecting records of every phone call in the United States even for those people who are not suspected of any crime it was a conspiracy yes there were some people who believed it was happening yes there were academics who could say this was technically possible yes there were technologists who could went this is something that could be done but what we didn't have it was we the world of 2013 we suspected some suspected that this was happening the world after 2013 we know that it's happening and this is the critical importance of journalism particularly in this moment that we have today the distance between speculation and fact is everything in a democracy because that's what what lets us as we did post 2013 change our laws now the very first program that was real to newspapers I has since been terminated Barack Obama who criticized me so strongly in June of 2013 by January of 2014 was proposing that this program be ended eventually it was ended under the USA Freedom Act the NSA argued that mass surveillance was legal bulk collection as they they call it they said 15 different judges authorized this what they didn't tell us was that those 15 judges all belonged to the rubber-stamp FISA Court that over 33 years had been asked 33 thousand nine hundred times by the government to approve surveillance requests only said tow in 33 years 11 times now this was a court that was never designed to interpret the Constitution right it was never designed to create novel powers for the intelligence community it was just designed to stamp basic routine warrants now we know what has changed the very first open court outside of these secret rubber-stamp courts that got this case in front of them I was judge Leon in a federal court and then a court of appeals and said that the NSA's mass surveillance activities were violating even the very loose standards of the Patriot Act they broke the law he further said these programs are likely unconstitutional and this would not have happened if we couldn't say this is real this is actually happening and I just want to make clear that's not me saying that that's not speculation that was the determination of the Supreme Court just a few months before I came forward in a famous case Amnesty versus clapper I I believe it was in February of 2013 or door December of 2012 all the way to the Supreme Court these surveillance authorities were being challenged the plaintiff said the government has a mass surveillance program it has impacted this human rights organization they have been spied on in secret by the government the government said that may be but if it's happening we will neither conform confirm nor deny that it's happening it is a state secret and because you can't prove it the court should be forbidden from ruling on the constitutionality of this program and sadly the Supreme Court of the United States agreed they said this program could be unconstitutional but if you cannot prove it exists we cannot evaluate it that's what 2013 changed on the legal side we have now had the GDP or we have firt had the first European regulation that are trying to limit the amount of data that can be collected secretly and used against populations broadly and we have also seen the basic structure of the Internet itself change in response to this understanding that the network path that all of our communications cross when you request a website when you send a text message when you read an email for so long those communications have been electronically naked or unencrypted before 2013 more than half the world's internet communications were unencrypted now far more than half are measured by just web traffic from where the world's leading browsers the Google Chrome browser some figures showed it more than 80 percent the entire world has changed in the last few years it hasn't gone far enough the problems still exist and in some ways they've gotten worse but we have made progress that would not have been possible if we didn't know what was going on related question what today can the government do to your phone and your laptop the phone and laptop of any American what's the extent of the government's reach if they're determined to reach into your life we could talk about this question for hours Brian but we don't have time so I'll try to summarize hacking has increasingly become what governments consider a legitimate investigative tool they use the same methods and techniques as criminal hackers and what this means is they will try to remotely take over your device once they do this by detecting a vulnerability and in the software that your device runs such as Apple's iOS or Microsoft Windows they can craft a special kind of attack code called an exploit they then launch this exploit at the vulnerability on your device which allows them to take total control of that device anything you can do on that device the attacker in this case the government can do they can read your email they can collect every document they can look at your contact book they can turn the location services on they can see anything that is on that phone instantly and send it back home to the mothership they can do the same with laptops the other prong that we forget so frequently is that in many cases they don't need to hack our devices they can simply ask Google for a copy of our email box because Google saves a copy of that everything that you've ever typed into that search box Google has a copy of every private message that you've sent on Facebook every link that you've clicked everything that you've liked they keep a permanent record of and all of these things available not just to these companies but to our governments as they are increasingly deputized as sort of miniature arms of government what about enabling your microphone camera if you can do it they can do it it is trivial to remotely turn on your microphone or to activate your camera so long as you have systems-level access if you had hacked someone's device remotely anything they can do you can do they can look up your nose right they can record what's in the room the screen may be off as it's sitting on your desk but the device is talking all of the time the question we have to ask is who is it talking to even if your phone is not act right now you look at it it's just sitting there on the charger it is talking tens or hundreds or thousands of times a minute to any number of different companies who have apps installed on your phone it looks like it's off it looks like it's just sitting there but it is constantly chattering and unfortunately like pollution we have not created the tools that are necessary for ordinary people to be able to see this activity and it is the invisibility of it that makes it so popular in common and attractive for these companies because if you do not realize they're collecting this data from you this very private and personal data there's no way you're going to object to it what about its ability to track its own and talk to me specifically about the case of Jamal khashoggi so in the case of Jamal Khashoggi this is a Washington Post reporter and a primary critic of the Saudi regime he was lured into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in Turkey and while his fiance waited outside for him to get the paperwork he needed in order to marry her he was murdered by the Saudi government allegedly on the orders of the Crown Prince now we have to ask ourselves how did the Saudi government decide that he was worth killing how did they decide when and how they would kill him how did they know this opportunity was going to arise how do they know what his plans and intentions were that they needed to stop from their perspective we don't have evidence that his phone personally was hacked unfortunately because we do not have his phone but we do have the phones of his friends who were living in exile in Canada and we do know thanks to the research of a group called the citizen lab affiliated with a university in Canada that their phones were hacked which means their conversations with Jamal khashoggi were intercepted and this allowed the Saudi regime to know that he was intending to create an electronic protest movement they didn't need to know from his friend's phone or even from his phone that he was travelling to the consulate because he had to make an appointment but it did tell them his private intentions his hopes and dreams for a different government for their country and perhaps although we do not know for sure on that basis they decided to murder him once your phone is hacked what is in their hands is not simply your device it is your future it's important also to remember how did the government of Saudi Arabia manage to hack these people's phones which are modern phones well they didn't have this capability in their government they didn't have this level of intelligence capability available to them directly so they purchased it from a digital arms broker a company called the NSO Group an Israeli company in this company the only thing they do is manufacture digital weapons kind of hacking tools they can be used against the critical infrastructure that all of us rely on the phones and our pockets they primarily target devices such as the Apple iPhone and they sell this capability to break into phones of people around the world for millions and millions of dollars to some of the worst governments on earth and the only meaningful oversight that they have unfortunately because the export control laws for these kind of digital weapons are extremely weak in Israel is their own internal ethics board this is oh it was fine we didn't break any rules that has to change what about the public attitude held by millions of everyday Americans all I've got on a computer is pictures of my family CCTV cameras that are prevalent in a ton of American cities and overseas capitals those cameras are your friend if you're innocent and have nothing to hide well I'd say that's very much what the average Chinese citizen believed or perhaps even still to this day believes but we see how these same technologies are being applied to create what they call the social credit system if any of these family photos if any of your activities online if your purchases if your associations if your friends or in any way different from what the government or the powers-that-be of the moment would like them to be you're no longer able to purchase train tickets you're no longer a to board an airplane you may not be able to get a passport you may not be eligible for a job you might not be able to work for the government all of these things are increasingly being created and programmed and decided by algorithms and those algorithms are fueled by precisely the innocent data that our devices are creating all of the time constantly invisibly quietly right now our devices are casting all of these records that we do not see being created that in aggregate seemed very innocent you were at Starbucks at this time you went to the hospital afterwards you spent a long time at the hospital after you left the hospital you made a phone call you made a phone call to your mother you talked to her until the middle of the night the hospital was an oncology clinic even if you can't see the content of these communications the activity records what the government calls metadata which they argue they do not need a warrant to collect tells the whole story and these activity records are being created and shared and collected and intercepted constantly by companies and governments and ultimately it means as they sell these as they trade these as they make their businesses on the backs of these records what they are selling is not information what they're selling is us they're selling our future they're selling our past they are selling our history our identity and ultimately they are stealing our power and making our stories work for them what devices do you use in your life now and have you accepted the notion that you are watched rather constantly well probably every intelligence the world is definitely targeting me in trouble anything they can just as they did with Jamal khashoggi in regards to what are my plans and intentions I try not to make that easy for them if I get a smart phone and I need to use a phone I actually open it up before I use it I perform a kind of surgery on it to physically desolder or sort of melt the metal connections that hold the microphone on the phone and I physically take this off I remove the camera for the phone and then I close it back up I seal it up and then if I need to make a phone call I will attach an external microphone on and this is just so if the phone is sitting there and I'm not making a call it cannot hear me now this is extreme most people do not need this but for me it's about being able to trust our technology my phone could still be hacked my laptop could still be hacked and just as I told you before the same principles applied to me if it is hacked they can do anything to the device that I can do so my trust in technology is limited but just because that's how it is today doesn't mean that's how it has to be and a large majority of my work with the freedom of the press foundation where I serve as president of the board is dedicated to trying to make technology more secure to try to create programs and protocols by which we can make the communications of sources and journalists more confidential because if we lose the confidentiality between sources and journalists we lose access to those essential facts that let us understand what's happening in the world and unfortunately under this White House just like under the prior White House we see the sources of very important stories that have advanced the public interest facing retaliation from a very angry government I believe it's in the first half of the book and I'm paraphrasing you come out and just say the computer guy knows everything or at least he should what part computer guy are you were you and what part trained spy well for the vast majority of my career I was what was called a systems engineer or a systems administrator an administrator sort of maintains and expands a system that they have inherited and a systems engineer sort of develops new projects new capabilities for these systems roles what this means in short was that all of the systems the NSA and the CIA that I was put in charge of I had total access to and this is just what happens with the systems administrator when you think about a computer system who gives someone else access well someone has to be the original authority that has access to everything that was me and so I would say the computer guy knows everything that's not a boast that's simply the way these systems are designed that's the way they're structured and this is very much a vulnerability because it means that you have to trust this this administrator will work to the good of the users but what happens when the people using that network the people constructing that network are going against the benefit of the broader society and this put me in a very interesting kind of conflicted position I could do what the NSA wanted me to do or I could do what the Constitution of the United States the the public of the United States needed me to do which was report that my agency had broken the law do you regard yourself as a journalist these days I'm not I'm not I have tremendous respect for journalists but I try to keep a distance particularly in this moment where so much of journalism is coming under attack because the government has a tremendous incentive to discredit me to make people distrust me and so if I hold myself out if I start reporting stories if I start talking to sources if I try to start advancing what the public knows on a personal level my reputation could could sort of poison instead I keep a distinction what I do is I try to aid the work of journalism but I am NOT myself a journalist your book is highly personal tell us about the price your then girlfriend now wife paid for your actions and how you feel she was miss portrayed in the eyes of the world when we got that first kind of thumbnail sketch of who she was so in the wake of the revelations of mass surveillance in 2013 this was suddenly the world's biggest story in every country they were talking about the same thing and unfortunately that meant that everyone who was connected to me in some way they were also talking about because they were trying to say who I was where I came from and this unfortunately meant that Lindsey my lifelong partner was intensely investigated both by the FBI in the United States she didn't know what I was doing I could not tell her what I was doing because if I had they would have said she was an accessory to the crime they would have said she was part of a criminal conspiracy so long as she didn't immediately pick up the phone and say help help someone's talking to a journalist and so this meant that I couldn't tell her she learned about what was going to happen the same way everybody else did about what is happening the same way everybody else did she saw me on TV which probably makes me the worst boyfriend in the history of the United States but she stuck by me and we are reunited and together today and I will never be able to repay her for the faith that she's shown me but the media had a tremendous amount of salacious reporting when they realized that she taught toll pole fitness classes which are quite popular for him in these days they called her a stripper even though she's never been one even though she's a poet even though she's a photographer they sexualized her they focused on her body they focus on her image because that's what got attention she's a much more complex and deep figure than the media ever gave her credit for she is more brave then anyone can possibly understand and she's more political and intelligent than any of these reporters at the time could appreciate her politics in fact influenced mine and I'd like to think I learned as much from her or perhaps even more than she ever learned from me you paint a portrait of what some of us knew and that was that you were a thoroughly American kid in your upbringing you wake up every day in Russia you go to sleep every night in Russia are you actively seeking to get out are you as has been reported looking for asylum elsewhere well this is not an actively seeking this is not a new thing and this is important history especially for those people who don't like me for those people who doubt me who have heard terrible things about me it was never my intention to end up in Russia I was going to Latin America and my final destination was hopefully going to be Ecuador when the United States government heard that I had left Hong Kong where I met the journalists they canceled my passport they gave press conferences about it which meant I wasn't allowed to board my ongoing flight which was going to take me that's a Latin America rather than applying for Russian asylum rather than saying I'll play ball with any Russian intelligence service just please protect me I said no I will not cooperate with the Russian government or any government instead what I did as I was trapped for 40 days in an airport I don't know a year longest layover is but 40 days was was a tough stint I applied for asylum in 27 different countries around the world traditional US allies places like France and Germany places like Norway that I felt the US government and the American public could be comfortable that was fine for whistleblower being and yet every time one of these governments got close to opening their doors the phone would ring and they're in their Foreign Ministries and on the other end of the line would be a very senior American official it was one of two people then Secretary of State John Kerry or then Vice President Joe Biden and they would say look we don't care what the law is we don't care if you can do this or not we understand the protecting whistleblowers and granting asylum as a matter of Human Rights and you could do this if you want to but if you protect this man if you let this guy out of Russia there will be consequences we're not gonna say what they're what they're gonna be but there will be a response I continue to this day to say look if the United States government if these countries are willing to open the door that is not a hostile act that is the act of the front of a friend if anything if the United States government is so concerned about Russia right shouldn't they be happy for me to leave and yet we see they're trying so hard to prevent me from leaving I would ask you why is that I'm guessing Joe Biden is not your candidate for 2020 actually I don't take a position on the 2020 race look it's a difficult position being in the executive branch it's a difficult position being in power and you have to make unpopular decisions I would like to think having seen now in 2019 that all of the allegations against me did not come true national security was not harmed as a result of these disclosures but they did win the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism the laws were changed as a result the courts said these programs were unconstitutional we live in a safer and more secure world because the Internet is safer and more secure as a result of understanding these common vulnerabilities which not just US intelligence agencies we're exploiting but our adversaries were exploiting one close these holes we do not become more vulnerable we become more secure in 2013 it's fair to say some of these officials some of these candidates grow well the intelligence services are saying this guy's dangerous they're saying this is a risk they're saying this shouldn't have happened in 2019 we can see that no evidence has ever been presented that the public understanding mass surveillance is real has caused any kind of harm whatsoever no one has died no terrorist attacks have succeeded because we knew about this stuff these programs work regardless of whether or not you know about them but we have seen the public benefits substantiated year after year after year and so I'd like to think these people would reevaluate their position you know there are government officials who would push back very strong on your assertion that national security was not harmed you do you chose not to stop with your revelations at what was being done to Americans and you got into America and its allies and perceived enemies when we're looking at the reports that were published in 2013 it's important to understand I never published a single story the number of documents that I revealed is zero what I did was I collected an archive of material showing criminality or unethical or unconstitutional behavior on the part of the United States government I provided this archive to journalists who were required as a condition of access to this material not to publish any story because it's interesting they could publish no story simply because it's newsworthy they were only allowed as so far as the agreement went to publish stories that they were willing to stand up and say we're in the public interest to know and this is not some crazy fly-by-night organization these are newspapers like the Washington Post like the New York Times like the Guardian and in every case this process was followed now as an extraordinary check on top of this in case I went too far in case I collected a document that was too hot or I misunderstood things or the jernt the journalists misunderstood things the journalists were further required to go to the government in advance of publication and they were required to do this at my request and warned the government this is the story that we're gonna run this is what it's about this is what we're gonna say so the government could argue against it to create an adversarial check on what the journalists and I were trying to do to reconstruct the system of checks and balances in the United States that hid itself failed in the government you know because that process was followed so scrupulously that's why I am so confident that no harm happened no harm occurred now if there are those in the government that say harm took place if there are those in the government who say people have died I ask you this why haven't they proved it you know better than anyone Brian that these government officials are more than happy to pick up a phone and make a leak to the New York Times every day of the week I if they had some evidence that somebody was hurt if they had evidence that a terrorist attack got through because of this journalism it would be in the front page of every newspaper in the world and despite six years of history that's never happened describe your life today what is every day like how are you supporting yourself and and as a simple equation if the Russians have reached so effectively into our lives and our electoral systems they must be all over your life so that was several different questions but yeah I'm sure the Russian government is trying to spy on me I'm sure the United States government is trying to spy on me everyone's trying to spy on me the thing is I don't cooperate with them my allegiance is to my country my allegiance is to my Constitution now in my terms of my daily life it's actually pretty ordinary Oh which is to say it's not so interesting I've always been something of an indoor cat right among nightclubs and partying my life since I was a child has always been mediated by a screen that's my choice so not much actually changes in my day-to-day whether I'm living in New York or Berlin or Moscow in terms of my work which a lot of people are curious about this I think is a polite way of people asking do you work for the Russian government do you accept money from the Russian government you know are you living in Russian government housing are you in a bunker are there guards and of course the answer to all of these is no no I'm not what I do for a living is speak professionally and now I'm actually an author I have a speaker's bureau it's called the American program Bureau and you can call them and you can book a public event I speak at universities I speak at corporate events I speak at cybersecurity conferences to talk to people about what is happening on the internet what is the future of surveillance and how can we protect ourselves I'm very fortunate to have had that opportunity and it's meant that I've had a quite comfortable life and in quite a difficult position the former White House aide HR Haldeman left us with an expression for the ages and when he said you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube for Americans who feel that that this is just a behemoth that they could there's no way they could have any control over it for Americans who long ago decided we're just going to have to live with this surveillance how could it possibly be receded or rescinded or stopped we can stop a program we can thwart an attack we can make a device more secure but as you imply the system is still better the institutions and agencies and companies that produced these attacks that are creating new methods of spying every day will still be there the fundamental change not just in the United States but around the world that has to happen is we have to stop thinking about the limitations on how data is used as data protection regulations right now when we talk about what Google and Facebook are doing right now when we talk about what the NSA is doing right now when we talk about what rival governments are doing what the Russians are doing what the Chinese are doing what the North Koreans and the Iranians are doing we're constantly thinking about all right this data has been collected and these companies have it how do we regulate their use regulating the use is a mistake we should do that but that's the wrong focus it is the collection of data that is a problem when you start trying to regulate use you're going to the collection has already happened the collection was already legal one of the fundamental flaws in u.s. privacy legislation is the fact that we are one of the only advanced democracies in the world that does not have any basic privacy law whatsoever we have the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution which is the reason that I came forward but that restricts what the federal government can do that restricts what the state governments can do it doesn't restrict what companies can do and as you know as everybody knows these companies are playing a bigger and bigger part in the world today we have to say all of these records that they're creating about all of us all this control that they're developing from these surveillance programs whether they're saying they're doing it for targeting advertisements or whether they're doing it for targeting killings these records belong to the people that they are about not to the companies and this is a fundamental change that we have never discussed in a meaningful way broadly and publicly but we have to because all of these governments have said you know the the mass surveillance system why do we have it why is it useful they say because of terrorism they say it's saving lives they save its oppressive anting attacks but no less than Barack Obama and the response to the 2013 revelations created two independent Commission's to investigate exactly the answer to that question were these programs effective in stopping terrorist attacks did these revelations cause harm to national security it was called the privacy and civil liberties oversight board and the president's review group on intelligence and communications technologies and despite having an enormous budget despite having complete access to classified information despite the fact that they interviewed the heads of the FBI the NSA the CIA you know the full alphabet soup they found in the government's own words the kind of mass surveillance that's represented by this bulk collection program where the NSA was secretly collecting the phone records of every American and everybody else around the world every day under an authority provided by a secret court order that nobody even knew existed that program had never made their own words a concrete difference in a single counterterrorism investigation think about that more than 10 years of operation and secret never made a single concrete difference these programs mass surveillance is not about public safety it is not about terrorism it is about power it is about economic espionage it is about diplomatic manipulation and it is about social influence it is about understanding the actions of everyone in the world as carefully as they can no matter who they are no matter how innocent their life final question has to do with the Fourth Amendment we have it today because mr. Adams and others wanted to keep the British out of their homes and their horse carriages what would mr. Adams and the founders make of the reach of the government in your view into our lives given its humble beginnings I think if any of the founders of this country looked around today they would be shocked by the kind of rhetoric they hear and they would be shocked by the kind of activities of government they see if you read the Bill of Rights something that struck me when I was writing about it and in this book was that fully half of the first ten amendments are explicitly making the work of government harder they're making life for law enforcement officials harder and all of the founding fathers thought that was a good idea because they recognized the more efficient a government is the more dangerous it is we want a government always that is not too efficient we want a government always that is just efficient enough because government holds extraordinary power in our lives we want government always to be using their powers in a way that is only necessary and proportionate to the threat presented by whoever it is that they're investigating when the government is getting by by the skin of their teeth the people are free right the government should be afraid of the people people shouldn't be afraid of the government one of the ironies about the founding fathers for those who are skeptical of me which is fair again I don't want you to trust me and I want you to doubt me I want you to question me but I want you to look at the facts I want you to look beyond how you feel in the moment how we all feel in the moment and see what these stories said in 2013 see that the courts of the United States where I'm being charged as a criminal said that the government itself was engaged in criminal activity look at these things and then remember the people who founded this country were called traitors the signing the writing of the Declaration of Independence was an outrageous act of treason it was criminal but it was also right the question whether or not I broke the law is less difficult and less interesting than whether you think what I did was right or wrong what is legal is not always the same as what is more final prediction then we'll let you go nightclubbing and that is do you predict do you predict you will at some point live out your life and die in the United States I think I will return when we look at the kind of things that we're being said about me in 2013 the kind of hostility I face the kind of accusations I faced from the most senior officials in government and we look at the world today yes there are many still who don't like me but far far fewer because we have seen that all the harms that they alleged over the course of these years never came to pass they were never substantiated because they don't exist but the benefits are becoming more clear with each passing year the question that I think people have to answer whether you like me as person or not right whether you agree with how I did what I did whether you agree with the work of the journalists who decided what the public should know in order to cast their votes today you know the government broke the law today you know the United States government had broken that violated the Constitution and the rights of people in this country and around the world would you rather not know thank you and Snowden thank you very much good luck with the book that's my pleasure Brian thank you for having me hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos""]"

LET\'S AGREE FOR THE SAKE OF THE NEXT CONVERSATION THAT DONALD TRUMP USES THE MOST COLORFUL LANGUAGE OF ANY PRESIDENT AT LEAST IN THE MODERN ERA AND SAYS SOME OF THE MOST QUESTIONABLE THINGS. AND THAT IS WHERE OUR NEXT GUEST COMES IN. JOHN IS A LINGUIST. HE HAS A PH.D.. HE TEACHES AT COLUMBIA. HE TOO IS COLORFUL WHEN TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND SPECIFICALLY HOW THIS PRESIDENT TALKS. THAT\'S WHY WE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH JOHN McWHARTER. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU, BRIAN. >> I\'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU, WHAT IS YOUR LING WIS TICKS DEFINITION OF THIS PRESIDENT? >> DONALD TRUMP LINGUISTIKALLY IS UNADORNED. THIS IS THE BASICS. THIS IS WHAT LANGUAGE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY LIKE WHEN IT FIRST EMERGED AMONG PEOPLE WHO DIDN\'T HAVE WRITING AND WERE FIRST GETTING THEIR VERBAL SEA LEGS. THIS IS WHERE IT STARTED. AND SO IN THAT WAY, AS IN SO MANY OTHERS, DONALD TRUMP IS AN ORIGINAL. >> THAT WOULD MEAN THAT EDUCATION AND SCHOOLING HAS HAD NO EFFECT ON HIS USE OF LANGUAGE WAJ. HE\'S QUICK TO REMIEPD US HE WENT TO THE BEST SCHOOLS. >> AND LEARNED NOTHING IN THEM. HE SPEAKS LIKE ONE WHO PAID NO EDUCATION TO ONE OF THE GOALS OF EDUCATION WHICH IS TO REFINE OUR SPEECH. HE USES THOSE SAME WAYS OF SPEAKING IN WHAT MOST OF US USED TO CONSIDER FORMAL. >> I THINK IN YOUR LINE OF WORK THEY CALL IT A TAG. WHEN SOMETHING IS ADDED TO THE END OF A TRADITIONAL SENTENCE. SO OFTEN HE WILL TAG A SENTENCE WITH BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE ME, AND ENFORCER. SOMETHING HE THOUGHT WAS LACKING IN THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE. >> UH-HUH. IT\'S THAT HE\'S REINFORCING. ALSO HE\'S USING ORAL SPEECH. WE\'RE CHECKING TO SEE THAT THE OTHER PERSON WE\'RE SAYING, THEY\'RE IN THE SAME BOAT WE ARE. THAT\'S WHAT ""YOU KNOW IS, "" THINGS LIKE LOL IN TEXTING. HE DOES THAT, TOO, BUT ONCE AGAIN IT\'S NOT IN TEXTING, HE\'S DOING IT IN FORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MEANS THAT HE NEVER LEAVES THE REALM OF THE CASUAL WHEN HE SPEAKS. WHICH IS UNLIKE EVEN SAY INDIGENOUS SOCIETIES WHERE THERE\'S NO SUCH THING AS READ NG AND WRITING, THERE\'S ALWAYS A HIGH AND LOW WAY OF TALKING. THE CHIEF DOESN\'T GET UP AND RUN HIS MOUTH, OURS DOES. >> THERE\'S A FRIEND OF OUR BROADCAST WHO WORKS FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND SAYS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THERE ARE VISUAL AND AUDIO TELLS THAT HE PEPPERS HIS SPEECH WITH WHERE IF YOU KNOW WHAT\'S COMING, YOU KNOW WHAT\'S COMING. I WANT TO RUN A MONTAGE OF A TRUMP PHRASE PEOPLE DON\'T KNOW. IN HIS READING OF IT. PEOPLE DON\'T KNOW FOR DONALD TRUMP MEANS I JUST LEARNED. HERE\'S THE EXAMPLE. >> FRANCE IS AMERICA\'S FIRST AND OLDEST ALLY. OUR FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, ABRAHAM LINCOLN RAN HIS FIRST F CAMPAIGN TORE PUBLIC OFFICE IN 1832. GREAT PRESIDENT. MOST PEOPLE DON\'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS A REPUBLICAN, RIGHT? DOES ANYONE KNOW? LOT OF PEOPLE DON\'T KNOW THAT. PEOPLE DON\'T REALIZE WE ARE A UNBELIEVABLY DIVIDED COUNTRY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT\'S A UNBELIEVABLY COMPLEX SUBJECT. NOBODY KNEW HEALTH CARE COULD BE TO COMPLICATED. >> YOU\'RE LAUGHING, WHY? >> THAT ASPECT OF HIM, I CAN\'T SAY ANYTHING PARTICULARLY LINGUISTIC ABOUT IT. HE HAS THE NEED TO BE THE ALPHA MALE, THE IDEA MOST PEOPLE DON\'T KNOW THIS IS COMING FROM THE SAME WELL. THE IDEA IS HE\'S ALWAYS THE ONE WHO\'S ONE STEP AHEAD.

AND SO OFTEN HE\'S SPEAKING, AND I THINK HE RUNS OUT OF NEW INSIGHTS SO HE COVERS IT WITH THINGS LIKE BELIEVE ME OR IT CAN\'T EVER BE THAT SOMETHING IS BAD, IT\'S VERY BAD OR VERY, VERY BAD. THOSE ARE HIS EQUIVALENTS OF ROUGHLY, UM OR SCRATCHING HIS HEAD. I HI THE CONTENT OF WHAT HE\'S SAYING IS SLIMMER THAN THE BULK OF THE VERBIAGE THAT HE SPUS OUT. >> HE\'S 71 YEARS OLD NOW PRESIDENT IN A AGE OF INSTAND TAKENIOUS FACT CHECKING. HE\'S NOT USED TO HIS AD-LIB BEING FACT CHECKED IN REAL TIME. DO YOU THINK HE\'S BUMPED UP AGAINST THAT DYNAMIC. >> I DON\'T THINK HE\'LL CHANGE IN THAT WAY. HE SIMPLY HAS NO DEODORANT WEARING SUNDAY BEST WAY OF SPEAKING, THAT INCLUDES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MORE RESPONSIBLE SENSE OF TRUTH THAN WHEN YOU\'RE JUST BSING WITH YOUR PALS. WHEN WE SPEAK CASUALLY ALL THE TIME WE SAY THINGS WHERE MAYBE IF WE CHECKED UP ON IT THINGS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. HE DOESN\'T UNDERSTAND IF YOU\'RE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU CAN\'T JUST TALK. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU\'RE JUST TALKING BECAUSE YOU\'RE MOVING YOUR MOUTH, BUT THERE\'S THIS OTHER ART THAT YOU\'RE SUPPOSED TO MASTER. HE WASN\'T NRD THAT SORT OF THING IN SCHOOL. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHOS NUMBER TO THE ARTFUL. HE HAS A NARCOTIC JOY IN DISMISSAL AND BEE LITTLE MEANT RATHER THAN BUILDING AND DECORATING. AND SO HE\'S GOING TO KEEP RUNNING UP AGAINST THE WALL. HE DOESN\'T UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU\'RE PRESIDENT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS WHICH ARE WHAT WE CALL TRUTH THINGS IN LINGUISTIC. >> ARE YOU JOINING THE INTERSECTION OF NARSY SISM AND LINGUISTIC. >> HE IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GET SOMEBODY EXTREMELY ARTFUL AND I THINK IT\'S SAFE TO SAY, CLINICALLY NARCISSISTIC AND TALKING ALL THE TIME TO US IN OUR HOUSES ABOUT SERIOUS THINGS. THAT\'S WHAT\'S SO STRIKING ABOUT LISTENING TO THIS PERSON TALK. WHAT\'S UNFORTUNATE IS HOW MUCH WE\'VE HAD TO LISTEN TO IT. I DON\'T THINK WE SHOULD BE UNDER ANY IMPRESSION THAT IT\'S GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE WE\'RE IN A INFORMAL ERA. IN A WAY, HE\'S A PRODUCT OF SOMETHING THAT\'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE MID \'60s AND IN MANY CASE IT\'S IN GOOD WAYS. IN AMERICA YOU AND I WOULD HAVE HAD TO WEAR DID HE DOORA ASSEN SUITS EVEN ON HOT SUMMER DAYS, BUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT LEFT WAS YOU PUT SPEECH IN ITS SUNDAY BEST. ALL OF US FAKE IT TO A EXTENT. WE COULD HAVE PREDICTED SOMEBODY WOULD COME ALONG WHO WOULD ONLY TALK RATHER THAN SPEAK AND BECOME PRESIDERESIDENT OF THE U STATES. I DON\'T THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO BE LAST IN THAT']"

Anthony foul she issued this warning about the new outbreaks we're now seeing a disturbing surge of infections one of the things is an increase in community spread and that's something that I'm really quite concerned about right now the next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgeons that we're seeing in Florida in Texas in Arizona and in other states foul she did add he believes there's a good chance we may have a vaccine by 2021 it can't come soon enough the virus has killed well over 100 21,000 of our fellow citizens it has sickened more than 2.3 million that we know of meanwhile both the president and members of his coronavirus task force today face questions about Trump's comment at his Tulsa rally on Saturday when he ordered his people to slow down testing in order to reduce the number of new cases [Music] I don't get as a member of the task force and my colleagues on the task force to my knowledge I know for sure but to my knowledge none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing we're gonna be doing more testing not less all of us have been and continue to be committed to increasing readily timely access to testing this afternoon and Phoenix Trump again made two more false assertions that contradict what we're seeing and what we've heard from the medical experts we're doing so well after the plague it's going away they'll say we have more cases now look we want to do testing we want to do everything but they use it to make us look bad we do all these tests and we find pockets so we find people and we find cases and they say the cases of German meanwhile a new report from The Daily Beast co-authored by Sam Stein who's standing by to join us says task force coordinator dr. deborah birx told the nation's governors and a call on Monday that it was vital that they ramp up testing that comes as the New York Times reports what would be something of a switch a change in the power dynamic if you will the European Union considering blocking Americans from entering the EU because the US has failed to control the virus times also reports Saudi Arabia has effectively canceled the Hajj the annual pilgrimage to Mecca for what some scholars say may be the first time in its history amid all of this Trump is continuing to spread unsubstantiated allegations against voting by mail which many states already do and others are considering during this pandemic here's what he said about it just tonight the Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail-in ballots using the China virus as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls Maryland ballots is a disaster for our country this will be in my opinion the most corrupt election in the history of our country and we cannot let this happen this is where you come in especially the part of your title that deals with preventive medicine and we're happy to have you so here was the second largest indoor mass gathering since the arrival of a pandemic the first was just Saturday night in Tulsa as this crowd waited in the hot Sun they were hit by the mist machines that you often see in Arizona atomized water and blowing air past them while they were gathered in bunches outdoors this happened on a day as we said of five new records for this illness in the state of Arizona if the White House had just talked to any number of the doctors who work for the federal government what do you think the advice would have been had they approached you what would your advice have been thank you so much for having me to clarify these issues when I see that video it leaves me feeling terrified because those are exactly the conditions that we identified early on in the pandemic that promote the spread of the pandemic there's a large number of people packed into a small space there's air flowing around pushing around potential coronavirus that could be circulating in that population and a real falsehood that I'd really like to clear up is that the reason we're seeing spikes is because of more testing our testing program right now is really the tip of the iceberg because we're testing people who present with symptoms we're testing people who've come in contact with people who have the corona virus what we don't know is how many a symptomatic individuals there are out there in the population and we can't know that number until we're able to expand testing for randomly sample in the population so this this picture this image of these indoor rallies is terrifying for what it's going to bring seven to 14 days later I want to play for you something your fellow Dartmouth grad Neil Katya all said today we'll talk about it on the other side I don't understand why bar hasn't been forced to testify I don't understand why the House of Representatives keeps on funding this justice department when they act in such a lawless way I don't understand why the subpoenas haven't been issued yet so you know I think you know our the first and most culpable parties of course that the Justice Department and the president but I do think that the house has something to bear here and the Senate as well so my ahirat in Neil's voice so much of this is done with such seeming brazen impunity will Congress get its courage on you know Congress needs to get its courage on because I think that the the urgency that you heard in Neil's voice is absolutely right it cannot go unanswered we can't have literally we just watched mr. Berman the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York who was appointed by Donald Trump who was a person who contributed to Donald Trump's campaign but was behaving as far as we can tell as a neutral prosecutor get pushed out of the job and frankly a very suspect explanation about why we have the Michael Flynn situation in which Michael Flynn pleaded guilty on two separate occasions and now we see the bar Department of Justice essentially trying to unravel that prosecution and his own admission of guilt this is outrageous the Democrats have to stop worrying about an election and start worrying about the Constitution because at the end of the day this is about whether we the people get represented to the degree that we should to protect the Constitution we have protesters in the streets saying we we are not receiving the equal protection of the laws at the same time that we're watching essentially people who are a powerful who can sidle up to a president and claiming this friend getting all kinds of special favors when frankly they're putting the country in a lot more danger than anything that we hear Donald Trump complaining about from protesters actually watching the president's remarks from top to bottom I was waiting for the emergence of some messaging that might have stood out as an emerging theme in the campaign and I guess it was the the threat of bedlam as he mentioned it at one point that if the Democrats are elected bedlam will come to all cities and towns in the United States he talked about the protest movement a lot in 2016 it was identity politics and nicknames that that that got him elected in the view of some as he looks at this next re-election having been robbed of the robust economy he thought he was going to run on is this kind of gonna look like what the campaign is absolutely I'd be the the campaign right now and his aides and his advisors are very clearly as they've told me casting about for a message he was robbed of the economy they aren't quite able to paint Biden although the president is trying as sort of a liberal socialist antifa member that's just not who Joe Biden is and the president doesn't know where to land and so it's created the situation where there is a ton of frustration between both the President and his campaign team in a lot of ways because if you listen to that whole speech there were some messages some scripted teleprompter messages embedded in there not necessarily devastating but are the sort of hits that his team wants him to land against Joe Biden but then the president does things like he he says he uses a racist phrase to describe the corona virus on the flu he talks about how he wants to slow testing down and that becomes the message and it derails everything so the campaign and advisers are furious with the president for being incapable of staying on message and he's furious with them because he feels you know you need to do your job you need to pack this stadium and when the president is casting about the final thing I will say is he doubles down on his gut instincts which is that sort of identity politics race politics dog whistle racially tinged and even racist language that we're seeing right now""]"

poured that before we got started missus this is just dead time only like Spica sure thank you very much Cheers yeah I thought I sort of flash back to the beginning of your career okay and asked if you always wanted to be involved in the comedy sphere when you were growing up and whether any particular showbiz icons that inspired you to go down this route well I did want to be in comedy from a very early age and I wanted actually to go to bear with me guys to go to Cambridge University alright because that was where John Cleese one of my big comedy heroes had started at the Cambridge Footlights performance review thing and this says a lot about my school that they said you're not going to get the grades for Cambridge but you could apply to Oxford because there was an entrance exam as an option which apparently there wasn't that Cambridge I don't remember so anyway so I decided that was I can do that instead so I was gonna apply to Oxford and so I came to Oxford with my parents and you know to do the kind of open day or whatever like I had to inspect Oxford to see if I thought it was good enough for me you know and and I remember I bought the t-shirt dude have you seen these t-shirts it's it's like it looks like the Guinness logo but instead of Guinness it says Oxford and underneath it says pure genius I imagine you all have them and all wear them and so I bought that t-shirt because I'm a wanker and that was all I ended up with because they didn't they obviously I failed the exam which means that I didn't get to go to Oxford University which means you're all cleverer than me which seems absurd this guy is cleverer than me I can and better-looking it's disgusting so so I ended up going to the University of Warwick and there at least I was able I did do a lot of kind of comedy related stuff so I did a radio show and I'd make short films and I took a show to the Edinburgh Festival and I kind of you know like I jumped feet first into sort of extracurricular you know student stuff keen as I was to do comedy from that young age mm-hmm and early on in your career you sort of dabbled in stand-up you know as once common to that it was notoriously difficult yes what challenges did you find with that medium well the problem with any kind of comedy is that you can sit in your room particular with stand-up you can sit in your room and write it and try out in front of the mirror and you'll just think you're absolutely killing it you know if it's just you in the mirror I mean I was crushing it night after night I mean I just thought I was amazing and then you go out in front of an audience and you very quickly discover it's much harder than it seems and unfortunately with stand-up there's no other way of trying out material you know you there's no machine that you can just try it that will tell you you know with a dial if it's funny and so it's tough you know because when you're starting out you maybe get five minutes to do material and you come out and you're nervous and if you screw up a line that's your shot at trying that joke out and then you've got a beg or steal another slot another Club another night you know it just takes a long time to sort of build up a head of steam and get the practice under your belt and all the rest of it and the first show I did I actually went well for the first five minutes and I just thought I'm crushing this and then the following shall I did was terrible than I died on me arse and and I just realised it was much much harder than I realized and over the years I've sort of you know I've done it in a compact to it and I'm gonna I'm working on some more at the moment but it gets a little bit easier the more you do it and then the more experience you get it's very counterintuitive stand-up so for instance if it's not going well you have a tendency as many of us do when we get nervous to speed up right like we're gonna just try and get through everything and actually the best thing to do is to slow down and take a sip of water and it just suggests that you're in charge you know and kind of eases everyone because one of the things with sound up is that the audience needs to be reassured that your income you're in charge because if you start to flounder they kind of over the audience because most audiences are on there on your side and they they sort of start to feel uncomfortable and then that makes you feel uncomfortable and then if everyone's like this including the act on the stage then you're in trouble yeah and what song was the creative process behind some of your skits to stand up what sort of material did you draw upon often was it different every time you kind of go back to it no it was it was being from the west country and you know and lots of I mean it was lots of jokes about inbreeding all right I was young and then I hit on this this character I would go on as myself but the joke was that I was an arrogant comedian from the West country and so I'd come on and I'd be like yeah alright this is a I'm here I'm gonna do some groups for you I got some great material you know but I didn't like your attitude when I came on but it's right would find that worry you know and I would very quickly the joke was that I sort of thought I was better than the club and I would never get to this routine I kept promising them this great routine but I never got there cuz I decided someone in the audience that annoyed me so I'd be like you got seem to have an attitude and I'm caught I'll come on again I want a bigger round of applause and it would just it was like it was an act that never got started and when the audience went for it it was the best thing in the world it was amazing because they would they were onside they realized it was a character and everything you said the more insulting you were to them the more self-loathing you were the funnier it got and then I would sort of in the end I'd say I'm all right this is not gone as well as I hoped I'm gonna leave I'm gonna walk off I want a huge round of applause so I'm gonna walk off and don't speak to me if you see me in the bar ignore me and I'd sort of I go to crap and they'd all pull out and I'd walk off and I'd leave it and it got quiet and then I would walk slowly back out and I'd be like you can't go out that way and if they were on site it was amazing but if they weren't on site if they didn't get the character I was fucked cuz I had no act and so they just thought I was an arrogant comedian from the West country so they were just they were just hair cool I mean I was I did a gig in exeter once when i remember someone actually shouting taxi for the comedian which i thought was a myth but they actually it was it was unbearable because i had nowhere to go and he it's not like i could step out and go guys it's a character i just had to keep going with it and it was brutal and so eventually i could have dropped that and i tried to sort of start being a bit more authentic and speaking as myself then when you heard for example white taxi for the comedian where did he find then the resilience to sort of carry on with you I didn't on that instance I remember a straight away afterwards phoning my agent and saying I can't do this anymore please get me out whole future geeks and um and he said well I can't you're booked in you know you've got fulfil your obligations and so then I went to the next gig the next day and it was in the darkest part of Cornwall and I thought well there's no way if the sophisticated people of Exeter didn't get this then there's no way Cornwall is gonna get it and Cole loved it and I was like I'm clearly amazing it was just Exeter I'm and every week we curve up and down you know and I be I know no I'm not gonna do any 1k more gigs and so yeah it was it was it was a rollercoaster you then transitioned into radio work and then obviously at the podcast work for you did you find it hard to be funny with he have that comedic flare when sort of the only tool at your disposal was your voice and so how did you do that I think radio is much easier in a lot of ways partly because you don't see the audience and by you know it you know it can be intimidating if you're staring out a room of people not you people obviously but but if it's if it's a crowd and there is a certain although most British audiences I think are on your side they don't always show it you know if you perform in America and stand up on the whole even if they've never heard of you there yeah this guy come on they're on your side whereas in England even if they know who you are there's a sort of funny guy and it's quite intimidating whereas with a radio audience obvious you can't see them and so it immediately relaxes you and also with I think with radio no one's expecting a work stand-up routine you know so you know if you think most DJ's are a pretty name on the whole and and there's a lot of that kind of the time is fast approaching three o'clock still to come we got tracks from storm Z and simply read I don't know what station that is but by the way the time cannot fast approach it can only just it's always going at the same speed but but so if you are a little bit witty on top of that then then then you're the best thing that anyone's ever heard and and plus you'll can always play a record so if you've run out of steam you can play a record and get out of it so radio was was fun and that was where I met Ricky Gervais is in that kind of how we got started and radio is great because it's very intimate you know I think people I guess podcasts do the same thing now but for years radio was a way of I don't know but you could privately engage with with people and they felt like you at the best they felt like you were a friend of theirs that they were listened to you know on a week on a weekly basis mm-hmm and then how did you solve work the material of n your podcast a british-based of a teacher ratio before was this all pre-planned or was a kamal Ganic well when it was initially was just Ricky and I on a radio station and we would kind of have a quick chat beforehand and then we would just make I was win along and then we got given this producer karl Pilkington and we asked him a question he was just there to press the buttons and make tea and things I forget we asked him a question or he was telling a story or something and he said something about bar habla and the neighbors you know and they were the neighbors that had a horse in the living room anyway and we were like what do you mean anyway let's go back to the neighbors with the horse in the living room and for him that wasn't the interesting part of the story and we quickly realized that he was sort of dull dust you know and he and he just almost anything that you asked him was was just only because he just had this completely unique view of the world and you know we were we were talking once about celebrities who were only famous because of who their father is so I'm in you know Calum best whose father was footballer George best ganker Gascoigne you know also and and we were saying they're only famous because of who their dad is and Carl said why you could say the same thing about Jesus and and you're sort of like yeah I kind of make sense it away I remember we asked he wants to explain evolution and he said something like um evolutions easy you know it's it's you know it's like slugs monkeys mermaids man and so um so he was just a he was just a never-ending you know supply of he's like if you'd found a magic lamp you know and you could just rub it every week and just magic would come out really so then it really became a show about him really and and off we went and so there was never any planning there I mean it was just showing up and unwinding Carl up into the you know until he spoke of course you are very well known for the office what was the creative process behind that show and do you think there's a recipe of success that I can ensemble comedy show well the office came about because I realized when I was initially on the radio with Ricky that I was probably gonna get fired or both of us were gonna get fired because before we worked with Carl we were on the radio on this London radio station called XFM and we were so essentially backroom boys who had to do jobs behind the scenes and went occasionally they let us on the air and I just sense that you know Ricky you know Ricky was probably gonna get us fired just because he never did any of the other work except for the radio bit he just he was lazy very lazy need hired me because I was gonna do the work and and so I sensed that we were in trouble so I got a job at the BBC when I was at the BBC I had to do this training film and the training film became this little if you like demo tape version of The Office and and for some reason it kind of it was good and Ricki was at brilliant and they just they were into it and they wanted us to make a pilot and then and we'd never done anything I mean I was sort of 25 and Ricki was just fat and old and and and we started making demands you know like um well we're gonna write this and he's gonna be in it and probably director as well produce it and I was mad thinking back and I think a lot of it was that Ricky was older and he he didn't care as but he wasn't so desperate to be famous or he kind of he was willing to walk away it was extraordinary it's something that I was 25 and I had didn't have that confidence because I thought this was a huge opportunity and so he so Ricky would be like well forget it then and I'd be like well this wait a second let's talk about it Rick we can and I was sort of the negotiator and and they let's do it and and and I think because we were nobody and because there was no expectations and cuz no one knew who we were and cuz it was cheap and the BBC kind of were just allowing us to do it quietly in a corner of the BBC with no it no one sort of scrutinizing us I think because of that freedom um everything kind of came together because there was sort of almost no pressure you know and everything he or I or together have done since that it's always scrutinized and there's a pressure and expectation and it's judged against your previous work and everything else whereas when we first came along it's like a new band that you know that people just like they'd like to get behind you know and and so I think it's very hard to create that that recipe again you know of everyone in it was pretty much unknown and were amazing talents and so I think it's plus I just think there was a sort of there was some kind of alchemy you know there was something that you just need to do good work that just the right elements came together and it was but it sort of no one goes into any project whether it's that or Schindler's List or sharknado not seriously not trying to do a good job of work you know everyone's trying to do could work it's just really hard to do anything well and particularly your the pressure of being supervised and scrutinized whereas in that case we were just left to our own devices mm-hmm so when the showed them so transcendence across the pond how much influence would you have in the u.s. office and for you is it a bit strange to see characters that you've worked so hard like into to create or reimagine through a different lens well our first aware sense of being aware that it was even known in America and it was still only the British version only known among kind of comedy fans and people but we got nominated for a Golden Globe and we went to America and they picked us up in the airport in a limousine first time in a limousine I was like this is this is amazing and kind of there and it's like free water and things free water I can't believe it and an ice tray and you can press buttons and the lights change on the ceiling and get to the hotel and then the BBC people there say there's absolutely no way you're gonna win a Golden Globe we're like all right they said just enjoy the free water and everything so the day of the awards comes and the limo shows up and that's amazing how quickly you were climatized and you're like this limos not as nice as the other one does it shit and we pull up and we're driving to the Golden Globes and Ricky decides yes I said to him I said to him eat something before you go because you leave in the middle of the afternoon I said he's gonna be starving by four o'clock sure enough he was so we're pulling up to the awards before we get to the awards he demands that we stop in a petrol station to buy the American version of what's it's Cheetos she buys a big bag of Cheetos and he eats now in limo on the way and now he's covered in orange dust and are in sort of coloring all over his face and his fingers in a tuxedo and so now I have to get my handkerchief from my suit like putting that in the ice trade like wipe off the orange like a mum cleaning off a toddler's face and we pull up and ahead of us is the other Desperate Housewives getting out of a car I'm thinking there's no way teri hatcher was cleaning orange dust off Eva Longoria's face we go in there and the gold lives is very exciting because there's film stars as well as TV people and are in there it's like Tom Cruise and Katie saw didn't it's unbelievable and we get there and we are uh so the our category comes best sitcom and the nominations are read out over and the announcement comes in it's us and no one was expecting us to win including us including the BBC who had told us you're not going to win and even the TV show because we're so far back we're liking their really crap seats like these guys at the back and and if you watch the footage the camera team can't even find us it's like searching for us musics playing and then eventually you sort of see me stand up confused and then sort of Ricky comes to there you know and then we sort of this motley crew make it our way to the stage and then the announcer who's no idea who we are it has to say our names and cuz Gervaise is its origin his french-canadian so I think he's just looking at these names and he just takes a guess and he's like welcome to the stage Ricky Gervais and Stephen Mitchell so if we get to the stage and I'm not joking I remember looking out and seeing Clint Eastwood like where this guy is here and I saw Clint Eastwood in Eastwood turn to the person next to me when lip-reading it's quite intimidating and and then they get late you know we won the award and then then Ricky won as well as a performer and suddenly you know you've gone there is just sort of tourists and you're kind of going to these parties afterwards like with you know two awards you and and and so suddenly people were coming up to us and kind of complimenting us on the show people you know samuel l.jackson or you know people that we subsequently asked to be in extras I follow show because we were just amazed that they were even aware of what the show was and then people came and they said look we you know we'd like to maybe remake this for America and the only thing I knew was that a lot of previous British shows that they tried to remake had not worked and my guess was because the original people involved had kind of meddled and didn't know enough about American TV and so the one piece of I think sensible advice that I had to Ricky was I don't think we should do this ourselves because I think we'll fuck it up and so we found good people to take it over and and they are the ones that can should get the credit cuz they just ran with it and and Steve Carell was obviously amazing you know if it went and so the most we really do I mean we sat down with them for a week and kind of just tried to explain like what's the equivalent of so I it's quite hard to explain to someone what equivalent of Slough is or there's just things you realize you don't like I didn't realize that pub quizzes aren't really a thing in into the workplaces in America just a little weird things you'd never even know about you know when off they went really yeah and was it hard to kind of let go of that or talk about the show really because it was to me it was like was like being a fan I could be a fan of this show that we had done and therefore we could never enjoy from the outside and suddenly they would send us these episodes which were kind of our characters but done by better-looking people and it was a thrill it was Bernard ever never anything other than excited and proud of it yeah and then when you moved on to extras you earlier spoke about the fact there's then the added expectation of people knowing that like Jimmy's merchant that's a dynamic duo how did he do an approach that new series and kind of stay grounded and not kind of get swept up in the hype what it was difficult because you know we were it wasn't that we wanted anything to do anything in particular about celebrities which is what the show ended up being about you know weren't extras working on movies it was just we started finding area that all these amazing stars Kate Winslet and Ben Stiller and all these people we admired were fans of our show and we're up for do it and they'd be like what do you want can we do something and so our original idea was to do a show about movie extras in which real stars were the extras so like it would be about extras but Kate Winslet be making a film but she would literally be walking around in the background never speaking and then that just thing once she agreed to do the show that seemed a bit perverse to not give her any lines at all so then we started writing its what scenes for them and then it was just amazing you know what they were willing to do and how far they were willing to go and and I suppose you know I think what what again because I was something of a fan of comedy like right back when I was younger John Cleese and people that I realized that it's very hard to kind of keep topping what you've done before it's better in a way to almost go sideways and just do something else to sit alongside it and so that was sort of the aim I think for extras and everything else we've done really it's just sort of to do something else rather than to try and do you know more and more versions or to try and do it something that's bigger and more high-profile and you know more successful in stuff and it's very different tangent um comedy seems to sort of work in fads would like for example panel shows like how I've gotten used to you dominating the arena currently what do you think that takes what makes something funny and why do you think we saw binge consumed certain categories of comedy at a time that is a good question I am I mean I think week when we came along there was a vogue for people reacting to the more traditional sitcom style the stuff that's shot in front of a live audience and that quite broad and often great but but a little bit you know more knock about and I think people were ready for something probably that was a little bit more realistic and loaf I and low-key and naturalistic and certainly that you know there was us and there was the royal family and there were these other shows and then I think probably somewhere on the line there's been a reaction to that again right and so now you have the biggest show British comedy show is mrs. Brown's boys which is extruding it I just but it just seems like it lives in another world like it's it's so far from what we did so I guess maybe there's a turn back away from that to something more silly if you like and knock about and colorful and jokey and you know and surreal whatever you want to call it and that and then presumably there'll be a reaction to that and they'll go back to something else so I think I'm I also think that you know we were in a period where we we could be kind of edgier if you like we were we were sort of we were trying to talk about real things and trying to reflect the office worlds we'd seen or the real worlds we'd seen in that it could be awkward and make you cringe and be uncomfortable and talk about you know real things and I think I sometimes wonder now whether they whether they'd let us do the office you know in the way we did it I wonder if we would have been censored more because I feel like we were living in an age where there is a little bit more sensitive to things and maybe we wouldn't get away with it I don't know and kind of been in that vein especially with an Idiot Abroad the humour is known to be slightly more tongue-in-cheek not anymore offensive no I don't mean that disingenuously I think cuz to me Karl is so it's like a sort of idiot manchild it's a heart it's like if a child said something offensive it seems harder to take it seriously if you know what I mean and I think because of knowing Karl that is sort of how I how I take it but I can certainly see from the outside it looks do you think in perhaps like a slightly more politically correct world it's harder for comedians to soar do their job because they're having constantly tread the line and evaluate whether they are being offensive as opposed to just trying to be funny well it's tricky isn't it because Carl you know for instance just to take Carl as an example in that show you know he's traveling the world and he's reacting authentically to the world around him and he doesn't he's ignorant I mean he is the little Englander personified you know he's a man I'm not joking who takes little banks of teabags when he goes to you know Mauritius or something for two weeks you know he like my parents might you know he's he's someone who you know you he's someone who could go on holiday when he chooses to go on a holiday and immediately look for a cafe that serves the following leash breakfast you know while in Spain and I think therefore if you send him to far-flung places he reacts you know in an authentic way that's not him trying to fish for the controversial thing to say I think he is just reacting and I think it's not only think it's born from prejudice I think a lot of it is born from ignorance or naivety and I think sometimes that lands him into hot water and other times it's sort of it's weirdly sweet I remember him visiting there you know the the the wall that divides you know Israel from Palestine and him just kind of just baffled by it like it was so he's just like it's so ugly I don't understand like he just he doesn't understand the nuance of that debate so to him he's just this like a child seeing this monstrosity and kind of not understanding it so you know it's really it's sweet in a way in terms of a if you like a smarter comedian choosing to wade into controversial territory I mean I don't know I mean I think you I think if you police yourself you you can be in danger of just being very Hannah dying because someone will always be offended by something you know I don't think that means you don't have responsibility I think you know it's your responsibility you know there's that famous quote whatever you freedom of speech doesn't extend to shouting fire in a crowded theater you know for a laugh and I think that's true but I do think I do think there's in a way there's almost an exchange between an audience and a performer you know and that if the performer if the audience chooses to take offense then they're well within their rights to do that but I don't know if that means they can shut down or sense of the person on the stage you know and it's tricky you know censorships a tricky thing because where does it stop you know do you allow people with the most horrendous views of public platform I don't know I mean I I don't I don't never understood the answer to that one I just think in the end you you know you have to be responsible for your actions and if you cause offence then you choose to either apologize or not and that's up to you I guess but I don't know if it's funny you talk about political correctness because it feels like that was exactly the thing that was in the air when we did the office you know it was political correctness was this sort of buzzword you know and to us that show was about a man trying to navigate that and not understanding kind of what the rules are or why what he thought was liberal was not you know or why he can't go up to a black guy and go tell you I love Sidney Poitier why he thought white to him that was that was a good thing to do why would you not why what's wrong with that you know and I suppose you on the surface you could look at that and go well it does that make the show racist well I would argue that the character is misguided and prejudiced but that doesn't mean the show is and I think with a lot of commit comedy in particular you can talk about difficult areas and tough subject matter without that necessarily meaning that you subscribe to the the offensive line of thought you know it's really tough yes so then kind of in that vein of comedy being able to talk to a specific topic perhaps more than something else when you have then shows like Trevor Noah for example where he uses comedy to tackle really really deep issues do you think that we're slightly over politicizing entertainment and comedy and it should actually sometimes just be a place of escapism or do you think it's now a duty for some comedians to use their power of being funny to illuminate issues that otherwise where he can't be done as well well I think I think that there's always been a place for satire I would sort of put Trevor and and you know a lot of those late-night American talk show hosts in that category of satirist s-- as much as anything um there's always been a long heritage of that and that's I think always to be applauded I do think though what's interesting is it generally is left-leaning satire on the whole and it might be interesting if if that was mixed up a little bit more and you had kind of right and left doing battle a little bit more in the same environment because I think there is that feeling that you know that Trevor Noah Jon Stewart before him those late-night host Stephen Colbert they're slightly preaching to the choir you know and to me it kind of would be interesting to see them sort of going head to head with people on the other side of the fence because I think that would just generate some interesting sparks creatively and also I think it might welcome in people from the other side of the argument who might then themselves learn a little bit more from the side of the fence they're not on you know and so um you know the when you when you attack Donald Trump however justify we might feel that is it's not moving the dial is it clearly because his fan base are not even aware of those jokes or they're just dismiss them out of hand and so there's a you know there's a great value in satire and thank God it's there because we all go crazy without it but it feels like it's voicing what we are feeling and letting us feel better that someone agrees with us and shares our pain rather than it making any change you know I mean I remember with the office you know people would come up to Ricky in the street and they'd be like oh that boss you play I'm just like him see you later like they were proud of that they didn't see it as a that we were mocking him necessarily you know so we used to say we haven't changed anything people who still assholes final question for me if I just open up to the audience so you recently starred in Logan and that was slightly more serious dramatic role compared to your previous ones do you sort of want to dabble in that area more and what was your experience from working on a blockbuster set well I definitely would like to do more drama I've always had an interest in there and I think you know even with the stuff we've done in the past we've tried to add some dramatic elements here and there and put me I've just done written and directed a film which is more of a drugs gonna draw comedy-drama I suppose which is about a real-life family of wrestlers from Norwich and it was it came about because I'm a dear friend Dwayne the rock Johnson he's friends with all of us he he was in England making a film he was watching a channel for which I just think it's amazing the image of him in a hotel like in a Travel Lodge or whatever wearing you know the there's you know the free kind of what you call it the free years of dressing-gown you know it's just a little bit too short on Dwayne you know is Johnson is visible to the world and easy in the shortbread and flipping through channel 4 and he's waiting for Grand Designs and this documentary comes on about this family restless and he desire dad work within before any any contact to me was like I think there's maybe a film in this and so I went to meet this family of Norwich wrestlers and um they're a whole family of the mum dad three kids and they all do that wrestling you know in that sort of WWE phony version of wrestling but it's not in the WWE in America it's in Norwich and the surrounding areas in real town halls and the dark dad is a former um armed robber who kind of found wrestling and it sort of saved him like some people are saved by religion and he's got these three kids and the to two of the teenage kids brother and sister auditioned for the WWE which is the big leagues of wrestling for a British person and only the daughter got signed so she went off to the States and had to train with them and meanwhile her brother got left behind and he in essence is sort of you know he it was very hard for him to deal with the pain of of that of being of that rejection and so you know the story on the surface you think it's just going to be this sort of silly knocking about thing about this kind of eccentric firmly but actually it so it becomes hopefully quite moving story of how you deal with kind of rejection when the dream that you've pursued all your life that you've been indoctrinated to do with by your parents doesn't come doesn't come off you know and and so just finish that and I think you know it it's that sort of it feels like where my heart is moving in terms of still using humor but kind of showing the flip of things because I think so much with comedy you know if you took away the laughter it would be tragic and bleak and in an interesting way you know so anyway so that's where we're heading thank you um now to open questions to the audience so if you stand up once you say your question and wait for the mic yeah remember in the orange top hi I'm thank you so much for coming today this has been so fun already my question involves working with the very a list celebrities on extras my favorite part about the show is how self-deprecating you guys ended up getting them to be and I think some more than others so how was that process was it a process of collaboration did Patrick Stewart for example suggest wanting to see everything right yes well he asked the amazing thing was we would come up with these ideas and I was just amazed at how often they would say they would agree you know and the the Patrick Stewart idea was that he would had written a script that he was trying to get made with in the show which I think it made in wedgy it was essentially just an excuse for him to see women naked clearly and in every version of the script he'd be like you know I'm riding on my bike and then you know I look at posh spice and then our clothes fall off and I ride on it and just sort of like you have this shit classically-trained Shakespearean actor with this rich voice talking like a child and you know and then you'd get you contacted his agent and get him on the phone and explain this idea I need to go quiet I mean it's like what and Riki somehow got hold of David Bowie's number or he'd met David Bowie somewhere or David Bowie how if you want to say and I'm I remember he said he phoned David Bowie and I think they've had a real I'm speakerphone I can remember and he said Bowie answered things like um or honor it I'm just eating a banana and to us we're like what David Bowie eats bananas ie bananas it's just the idea that he's at home with his supermodel wife in Monaco any bananas and and it's amazing how quickly you sort of realize they're actually actors on the whole they still want to act and do fun stuff you know and and that you know if you're on a film it's a big blockbuster film it could be months and months and you're stuck and you do very little acting and mainly waiting around whereas for us we promised them you know you'll be in and out a couple of days you'll have a laugh if we found any ideas you have for him in the mix they'd be like yeah great so you know they'd show up and there's almost nothing they wouldn't they wouldn't do I can't remember them even saying that it is almost always that they had a scheduling conflict rather than that I think there was a children's entertainer that was popular when I was a kid called Keith Harris who had a green bird called Oroville that he was mentally equipped and we asked him if he would be in any and he read the script and said it was the most fucking disgusting thing he'd ever read was he I know if that was him or or Orville that said that but he he refused to do it but but everyone else was on board extraordinary I know I still don't know how that happened really it's baffling remember in the brown jacket so your timer XFM is often seen as being soft the beginning of the podcast era yeah and helping sort of pioneer this new sort of resurgence of radio maybe in a new form of entertainment are you proud of that sort of cultural legacy did you have anything anywhere that size in mind when you start out well I it's funny you know as you walk around the Union you see those pictures of you know pioneers in various fields like um you know Einstein and Malcolm X and we got karl Pilkington to talk about eating penises you know when he's in the jungle so yes a pioneer in every but I didn't know what a podcast was and and Ricky suggested there's this new thing where you know you download it straight to your iPod at the time whatever okay I've no idea and we started doing them and and then it was fun because you had none of the restrictions of radio it's obviously with radio is still restricted in what you can say within reason with a podcast at the time you had gloves off you could say anything and and it just suddenly we were in the Guinness Book of Records for the number of donors I mean that's because there was literally no one else doing it so it's easy to win a road record when no one else is doing it but um but now as a pot as a keen podcast fan I love it I'm very proud that we were sort of that we were kind of ahead of the curve on that and it's funny I've done people's podcasts since and they've talked about ours as being kind of instructive and informative for them and I've met people you know I was in Vietnam I met people listening to the podcast and people all over the world because there's sort of something is a great democratization with that you can just download it from there anywhere in the world and listen and and and that's I think one of the most exciting things about media now that there are since when I began is that it's just it's kind of wide open it's like an international field do you know if you want to do a podcast about you know I don't know that the nerdiest weirdest I mean I just did one recently that David with your hosts that oh there is only about David Bowie that's all they talk about just Dave about it from weeks hours at a time of just just Dave about it and there's people listening you know because there's enough fans and I think that sort of extraordinary and it's a bit like in the way that the internet seems to have opened up every possible sexual perversion that anyone want like whatever crazy perversion I want addresses and know why I do right yeah there's four million other people that want to do the same things not I've googled not known you know I mean you can just reach out you can find kind of almost anyone that's interested in what you're interested in thanks to the the web and so yeah I love podcast I'm proud that we were part of it the member in the aisle so I've so I've earned up if you're gonna talk to me okay I watched the American version of The Office and its influence on me has largely been that I now you know imagine hell as being stuck in the universe of that show yeah but so you said that you that the success of your original show was rather unexpected so I'm just wondering sort of in retrospect what do you think made the show so successful well I think um we discover you know about 50% of this country works in an office apparently and I'm sure that's true of most of sort of you know the sort of industrialized world and and so therefore I think that that immediately there's something relatable about just that as a working environment and then I think um we tried to be as authentic as possible we spent a lot of time literally sitting talking about people we'd work with in other offices and it seemed to us there was always this sort of guy who you know at the time wore his mobile phone on his belt and always had his laminated security pass and was a real kind of jobsworth you know across the t's dot the i's type and we knew we needed someone like that and we there was the boss who wanted to be a friend but was also the boss and was trying too hard and we both worked in places where those people existed and the guy that's just trying to get through the days you know and perhaps didn't really want that job but it's just sort of wound up there and um and then you know it just turned out that those people are in every country and started in America but they we did a French version and a french-canadian version of an Israeli version in a there's a South American version in and I think that I'm not joking that the Germans did a version without asking permission not like the Germans to take something without asking but um but anyway forgiven forget but but yes so it clearly there was something that was that was very relatable you know and even though you could change it for sort of regional specifics that the core of it I guess was relatable you know but again I you know I think if we'd sat out to do that we'd have never achieved it remember in the front row in the beauty shop thanks for coming one of my favorite parts or several parts in an Idiot Abroad is when you guys push Karl seemingly over the limit of having him stay places that he genuinely looks unhappy or the whole bungee-jumping skit how much of that is real and how much did he know was coming when he signed up to it I think in the first series he did not know what was coming ever and he was genuinely alarmed and there's a lot on the cutting room floor of him just just angry not entertaining for anybody it's just him I think by the second series in order to persuade him to go we didn't tell in the specifics but we would give hints just because he just refused to go otherwise but normally the limits if we were pushing into the limits that was not him playing acting that was him almost sort of trying to negotiate with the producers you know as to exactly I mean the bungee jumping you know I mean we wanted him to do the full bungee jump and he refused and he does some tiny little and I forget if he does it doesn't he just jump off like a from like a foot you jump jumps from there to there he was pathetic and so now and then he goes ultimately he and he's doing his own stuff now because he doesn't want to share the money with us or sensibly be tortured without him knowing because that's the thing you know once you make someone a celebrity they then have a lot of power and they can turn around and go now why on earth would I eat a sheep's penis in the jungle you know so but no but it's not it's not him it's not him - turning it on for the cameras really it's not it's not manufactured in that way yeah yeah remember in the flu shot hi there so as a gamer I'm a really big fan of your performances Wheatley in Portal 2 thank you and so I was curious whether what was your experience like working with a big name like valve and did it encourage you to work further in the gaming industry well I did this voice for this video game called portal 2 which I had no idea about portal or portal 1 or any of that stuff having given up gaming just after University I think in university I'm a good deal gamer now because I think afterwards when you do a real job you don't have quite as much time to game as I've discovered so I kind of stopped doing it unfortunate because I just at the time but um so I by the time I got to do it I'd sort of you know cuz I was really into games for a while but I just I didn't know what's going on anymore and then they said that this had been a big game would you like to do it whatever it go that I liked video games that seemed like a fun thing to do and what I hadn't anticipated is that when you do a video game you you you don't just do the voice for every for just the route through the game you have to do every possible Avenue that the gamer like you might take let's assume you're a terrible gamer and that half the time you're just like you know walking into a wall and you don't know how to sort of turn him around then I have to do all the voice Bert you're walking into a wall you dig what you're doing turn around nob you know just have to do that for every possible idiot thing that you might do playing a game you know do your studies you lose there or whatever it might be and and so it was exhausting it was crazy because you just went on four days of just every possible route but but the freedom on the flip of that was that they were very open to just letting me kind of ad-lib and play around and sort of insult the player and things and and afterwards it turned out it was really good fun and there are people that because of great thing about video games they sort of sit there and some of them just you know are getting people are discovering them all the time and playing them all the time bit like podcasts and so I still get you know people all the time sending me pictures of the game or knitting me little little dolls of Wheatley and and it's wonderful because I sort of I'd forgotten just how vast the gaming community is and sort of if you're not playing it all the time you kind of it slightly slips off your radar and you know famously the gaming industry is it's it's a much bigger industry than the film or TV industry and it's a billion dollar industry and you realize it's just this again a swathe of fans all over the world who for whom you know and they've sort of spend I don't know how long it took you to play that game but I would imagine it's you know it's a couple of days or whatever I don't know and so you're just there it's just you talking to them you become like a friend so it's great I would happily do it again I haven't been asked to do again but but it was good yeah and that's the thing is I kind of like you know it's times gone on and opportunities have arisen I I'm I just like kind of like to follow the opportunities that come and I would never thought about video games but he came along and it was and it was something that was fun to do and it's funny like when I was younger and I would look at people's career it's like John Cleese and I think you know why did they do that and why did they choose them what a weird what and then you realize it's just sometimes fun things come along or you try something it doesn't work or whatever you know that it's very few people that can have a master plan of of kind of what their career is going to be dated the member in the floral shop hey thank you I had a question actually about this to humor that you have because in the shows and in the podcast love the humor revolves around physical appearance whether it's Carl's head or in the office with the augment stare so how did that arise was that something that you just found to be effective and then how do you not take it personally when it like does it ever go too far yes yes well I guess you know what the world reasons I got into comedy was I remember you know at school feeling I mean I was six-foot-seven by a young age you know and so I was I was talking to some guys before about how I used to really enjoy dancing in kind of clubs and pubs and places with other people you know not just not just get out dance and and I remember I say to these guys like you know I was dancing once I you know because I got the moves they come on and and I caught my reflection in a mirror dance for a wall and I realized that I was about two feet taller than everybody else dancing and I suddenly really self-conscious as I looked like um like a substitute teacher you know at the school disco who's there to something you know it's just it was really weird and I just I became pretty self-conscious about that and I think um when you are very tall than if you've got glasses or whatever or you I don't know you when you're a teenager you know you have those those insecurities and and I remember someone saying to me once in an interview do you think you use humor to control when people laugh at you and right that might be true that might be just a fancy way of saying it but I think there's some truth in that and I think because I always sort of felt a little bit awkward in that way it seemed natural to make fun of the way I looked or the height or whatever sort of before anyone else did and then as we moved into working with other people you know certainly when I met Ricky he was short and fat and in my mind old in actual fact he was younger than I am now but there we are and you know Karl obviously does have a head like a fucking orange so you mean you use what you can have plus also just sort of physicality is some you know using your body particularly if your toy no I think just it it's fun I tried to do that in this American show I did how the ladies would have just used the physicality of you know like this whole sequence where I was outside a club and they wouldn't let me in and they were talking about the kind of that red velvet rope they have to let you in and out and obviously for me I can just step over it really easily and I was just playing with that harlot because it's sort of absurd that this barrier I'm in and I'm out you know and just so that's that's always a joy to do I mean I don't I don't I think we've very we've never picked on someone's physically that they didn't give us permission to to joke about you know I mean so we don't spring it on anyone so if there was any jokes in in any of the shows we did that the people were always on board with that because yes he is a hurtful if summons that's the terrible thing is that I can joke about my height and I've given permission to Ricky in car but if anyone else makes a joke I'm furious you know I mean just you know and again the weird thing about height is people it's seen as an achievement you know fuck you know you're tall you like you prick like I'm supposed to go well thank you sir I appreciate and so um and so yeah it was not a day goes by when someone doesn't kind of mention it or talk about it and so I figured like you know what I can't pretend it's not a thing I think what was more insulting was when they asked me to do Logan they say would you like to be in a superhero movie and I'm like bigger than the gym finally the calls come and I've you've not seen the film I play a giant albino or Albee no mutant with you know terrible skin a shaved pale head freakishly tall weird eyes I mean it was it was typecasting and so yeah I mean I think the only reason I got that role is there's not a lot of six-foot-seven freaks in Hollywood you could save them a fortune on the prosthetics or CGI it's just annoying I didn't get to do Gollum I could have been absolute shoo-in for Gollum the precious or whatever I don't see yeah remember in the communist Thanks I wondered how your relationship with Ricky has changed over the years too many now he's seen as kind of a slightly different persona at least publicly right now than he used to be well i'm i don't know i mean i think the the disparity between kind of Ricky's public image and his real image is one that because when you do stand up you and comedy you you sort of blur that line because you use your name but you're magnifying or exaggerating or taking positions on things you know I mean even someone as seemingly safe as Michael McIntyre I'm sure he's not as furious about you know airports as he's pretending to be you know he's probably getting by like most of us in an airport pretty easily it's just that you know he'll magnify his frustrations for a comic effect and certainly Ricky does that and I think in the age of social media he does that even more I think he'd like he's always liked sort of provoking he's always had a kind of sort of punk rock edge to him even from when I when we were first working together that idea of sort of you know there's a famous interview with the Sex Pistols you know where they kind of are on this bill Grundy TV show and kind of you know causing trouble and I think this is a little part of Ricky that likes that that like it's kind of prodding and getting a reaction which I don't really have in the same way I think I've always quite liked the idea of just slipping on I'm just I'm here I'm just gonna sneak out the back guys you know and so I think probably just as he's got more well known you know that sort of has come to the fore and he's sort of he's indulged that more but I think you know when you work with him or you know him I mean he sort of is it's just you know he's hard-working and he's very reflective and he's very thoughtful he doesn't you know he's not he's not that person that he's not that it's not his ship if you know what I mean so um you know I don't know I mean it's hard it's yeah I I've not done a sort of enough of an analysis to say but certainly I used to joke with him I used to say you know Rick someone asked me if celebrity has changed you and I told them know you've always been a cunt but that stemmed more from the fact that he had very difficult eating habits he just would he was he's got that appetite of a child and so we would just spend hours of writing time wandering around looking for you know baked beans on toast or fish fingers fish fingers are quite hard to find sometimes in in North London for lunch so that was my main objection to him and when I first knew him he was very consuming he was very lazy which has changed the memory in the blue t-shirt very hi Steve big fan especially your ex femme work building on the previous question I was wondering if you would still consider working with Ricky or possibly Carl and feature I would do yeah absolutely yes there's not there's no there's no reason not to I think I think certainly with the radio stuff of the podcasts we just you know we did a lot of hours of that in the end I mean I wouldn't want to talk them up but you know we did the radio show every week for you know that's 2 or 3 hours at a time and we did that for quite a few years on and off we did a lot of the podcasts and that's a lot of time speaking in a room with each other and you just at some point you start to feel like you're going over the ground you know and even as someone as rich and genie in a lamp as as Carl there's only so many times you can go back to that well without it starting to feel like you know overkill but yeah if I mean we used to push what we should try to get Carl to do tour torrents you know like university tours and three of us would sit and you know we knew you guys could ask him questions and we never we never do it he was always fearful of going out on the road or and so that was a bit of a missed opportunity because that would have been fun and maybe that's how we could still do in the future that Beefalo thing what about a TV show or a film with ricky yeah possibly i mean i think i think a lot of it comes to me comes down in part because we're sort of in different parts of the world a lot i spend a lot of time in LA and he's in London or in New York and also I think you know we work together again sort of pretty cheap by channel for over ten years and I think it's just that feeling of slightly kind of having different of being pulled in different directions clearly you know sort of I feel like you know like you're saying with the drama I could have weren't interested in that and not that he's not but I think generally he wants to perform in the stuff he does and I feel like I'm quite happy to from neither of us to perform and to let other people perform and I think it's just not quite something he's interested in and because I think a lot of Ricky's humor is about him putting it across and him presenting it which is why he's so good at stand-up whereas I'm kind of more interested I think a little bit more in their sort of nuts and bolts of making stuff and and I think also he's quite he likes to just get stuff done you know he just he's impatient he likes to just do it whereas I kind of are happily spend months years kind of grinding it out you know so I think if the right idea was there I'll be good to do something but at the moment there's nothing on the horizon okay I mean we have time for about two more questions so would you like to make the last tip I just down I'd I'd hate to upset someone please know you can do a great job can I remember in the Navy jumper are there any British comedies that you particularly enjoy at the moment British comedies I enjoy at the moment well I don't watch a lot of stuff only because I always feel like I'm gonna get jealous if it's really good you know I genuinely do like I like hum what's that I forget its name as it called them people that don't do nothing or a people only do nothing nor is that what's it called you know the one I mean what's it cool people don't do nothing yeah which i think is great a camera or its name but I love it I think it's really funny I just I know there's loads of great stuff people keep raving about I just haven't I just don't watch anything weirdly I watch a lot more and I don't know I think maybe with comedy I just feel it either I'm gonna be jealous because it's so good or I'm gonna be there sort of thinking I would've done it like there and you know the mean so no I just nobody knows I don't know what's going on it was a comedy I haven't heard this I've just seen clips of it and it looks terrific it looks brilliant yeah I saw a great thing with someone trying to put a wheelbarrow of rubbish in it you know skip from that show that was absolutely hysterical where he's somehow is he somehow is that his legs end up on the to plank I forgot it's but it's brilliant google it geez I'm not even screaming but that looked great that looks really good look brilliant it's just weird sort of you know with things like that when people mention it to me they say oh you know they've obviously been inspired by the office you just think that's so weird that you know we're the sort of granddad's of comedy now you know in I mean it's just so depressing but ya know otherwise I don't really see much I feel bad I thanks for coming um I think that one of the highlights of extras was your relationship with Barry and I was just wondering how that came about and how you kept him Barry from EastEnders of everyone yeah you know I cannot remember how an earth that came about why on earth did we think we could take a night to have been in EastEnders and say you're gonna be in our show you're gonna get no work we're gonna just portray you as a complete loser and I will be your agent and I'm gonna pretend I don't even remember your real name I can't I mean I that's what how on earth did we suggest that to him I can't remember whether had he met him somewhere I can't remember but um clearly he agreed to do it and he is Shawn Williams that he's an absolute joy that man he's just he's he's the nicest man in the world and he does nothing you can say to him that he won't do you know Shawn you're gonna get caught ranking over a nudie pen yeah sure I'll see you Tuesday and in fact recently he got married he got married again and and so I sent him a video that I did as my agent character just wishing him well for his wedding but saying about how I'm furious I'm being in what I've heard you're doing a wedding I don't know much you getting paid but I should be getting a cut of that you know and then it was great I'm really pleased he's amazing he's great and that's what I mean it's just to so many people that means people we've worked with that I just I could you know we could write whole series just for them you know because they're so they're so talented there's such a roster of talent in this country it's amazing but how on earth we persuaded him to do it I have no idea Dean Dean Gotham I'm calling Dean Gaffney you're gonna be again we're gonna say you're a loser you can't get any work you're working in The Carphone Warehouse yeah fine nobody I think that's all we have time for for today but could everyone please join me in thanking Steven for such you""]"

welcomes I've had from you alright yeah thank you for coming if you'd like to give a few opening remarks and then we'll move on to some questions okay so I have about half an hour for this I guess about 15 to 20 minutes for the open case so I think I'm going to talk to you today a little bit about hierarchy it's a small talk that I've been developing as I've been doing my public lectures over the last couple of weeks it's an elaboration of some of the ideas I put forth in on some of my scientific writings and in maps of meaning but more particularly in 12 rules for life in rule one which is stand up straight with your shoulders back and it's in part of meditation on hierarchy and I want to talk about the political significance of that and let you know how I've been trying to sort that out in my own imagination so I'm gonna put and I think it sheds light on on the political on the nature of political debate itself and maybe deeper light on why temperamental factors might contribute to political political framing and perception because we know that people tend to vote their temperament although there there are other reasons that influence their political allegiance and their voting behavior so let's start with a couple of simple observations and the first is that complex biological creatures and even simple biological creatures for that matter have to move forward in the world and so that's the case for any creature that's mobile and that goes all the way down to one celled organisms the idea that approach and avoidance are the fundamental motivations is a very old biological idea and seems to apply across levels of analysis in the in in the animal kingdom and and it's true for us as well and we have to move forward towards things because we have requirements there are things that we require to keep us alive and to keep us wanting to be alive as well and those are different things and we move forward towards things that we value so there's two propositions there the first is that we have to move forward because there are things to move forward to because there are things we need and want and the second is that to move forward towards something is simultaneously to value it and so one of the implications of that is that we always live in a framework a value there's no escaping that and that we're moved for our detail that this out quite substantially in my book maps of meaning but we're always at a place and and and we're always moving towards a place that in principle has some advantage over the place we're at otherwise we move towards it and so what that means is that there's no life without value at least there's no human life without value out of necessity and also not only out of necessity at the physiological level but also out of necessity at the psychological level because another thing that you might point out that I think it's usefully pointed out is that not only do you have to move from point A to B in life but point a is often a very difficult place to be because we're fragile and bounded and mortal and limited and because we know that and so one of the implications of that as many great religious traditions are at pains to illustrate or demonstrate or proclaim is that life is essentially suffering and I believe that to be a fundamental truth but but perhaps not the most fundamental truth because I think the most fundamental truth is that despite the fact that life is suffering people can transcend that and partly the way they transcend that is by pursuing things of value and so that if there is no value proposition at hand then you have no meaning to justify the difficult conditions of your life and that's brutally difficult for people no Nietzsche said he who has a why can bear anyhow and you see and I've certainly seen this as a clinical practitioner that people who have no purpose in their life are embittered by the difficulties of their life and they become first bitter and then resentful and then revengeful and then cruel and there's plenty of places to go past cruel that's just where you start if you're really on a downhill path alright so those are the first propositions the second proposition would be well if you're going to pursue something of value because you're a social creature you're going to pursue that thing of value in a social space and that means you're going to compete and cooperate with people around you in the pursuit of that value and what that inevitably means is that given that the pursuit of anything valuable is going to be a collective enterprise that you're going to produce a hierarchy or maybe more than one hierarchy but at least a hierarchy of competence in relationship to that pursuit so it doesn't matter what you decide to pursue maybe you're going to do that cooperatively you're going to find that you and other people vary in your ability to manage that pursuit effectively and and efficiently and so there's going to be a hierarchy of people from those who are very good at the pursuit maybe it's pole vaulting maybe it's delivering massages maybe it's delivering groceries maybe it's setting up an enterprise it doesn't matter but if it's a valuable Purdue pursuit and you pursue it socially gonna produce a hierarchy and the hierarchy is going to be one of competence and so if you're going to pursue value then you're going to construct a hierarchy and then there's an implication from that which is that if you construct a hierarchy most of the people within that hierarchical structure are a minority of people are going to be fantastically successful at the pursuit and a very large number are going to stack up at the bottom and that's a manifestation of what's what's known as prices law it's mapped by the pre distribution it's an expression of what's been known among economists as the Matthieu principle from the new testament to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing everything will be taken away and it's an it's an iron law of the distribution of success in hierarchies so if you're going to have value and you're going to have hierarchy then you're gonna have in equality and that's a problem now you can't so now now you have a political divide there so the conservative types say about we need two hierarchies and that's self-evident as far as I'm concerned given that set of propositions because if you don't if you're gonna pursue something of value which you have to and need to then you're going to produce a hierarchy so if you demolish the hierarchies you demolish value itself and that's not a tenable a tenable move the left-wing though says and to their credit yeah but you have to be very careful with your hierarchies because they tend towards inequality of distribution that's one problem once they're established they always also tend to a form of tyranny because once a hierarchy of competence has been established it can be invaded by people who use power as the means to attain status in the hierarchy and that can corrupt and destroy even the entire hierarchy so you have to be on guard for that plus if your hierarchy becomes too steep in its distribution so it's too tiny a fraction of people at the top and too great an agglomeration of people at the bottom especially under conditions of genuine privation then the people at the bottom it's not only unjust and unfair and producing excess suffering but the people at the bottom have nothing to lose and might as well just flip the hierarchy on its end and that's not a good way to produce a sustainable society you don't want to put people in the position where they have nothing to lose especially if you have something to lose but also just with regards to principles of like fairness and justice let's say so it seems to me that that's a decent way of conceptualizing the political landscape and that gives that gives you a conceptual framework within which you can put people on the left and right in their proper position the right basically is that portion of the population that's temperamentally that who's temperamental proclivity is to admire and support hierarchies and work effectively within them and that's actually the personality traits that make up a conservative because conservatives by temperament are low in trait openness which is a creativity dimension that's associated with lateral thinking it's not I would say it's it's very environmentally underdetermined it's it's it's a biological predisposition especially with regards to creativity and high in conscientiousness and the conservative temperamental types make very good managers and administrators that's how they manifest themselves in the world essentially if you set up a hierarchy and it runs on algorithmic it runs algorithmically then the Conservatives will do very well in that structure because they can implement an algorithm and they're very good at implementing whereas the liberal pipes are very good at generating new hierarchies and so and that's and that's because they're hired trade openness they're less conscientious so they're not suited as well to do within hierarchy operation but in a functioning economy and in a functioning democracy I would say you need both types you need the liberal types to establish new territory and to put out new values so that new hierarchies might be organized so that effective movement towards those ends might be instantiated and you need the Conservatives to actually implement the processes and so a society of only conservatives becomes static and that's not good because the environment transforms and you have to keep up with it and a society that's only composed of the left-leaning liberal types is very good at generating all sorts of new possibilities but very bad at generating all sorts of new actualities and so we should be first of all cognizant of the fact that hierarchical organization is inescapable if you're also going to pursue value second that if you produce hierarchical structures that you're going to produce inequality inevitably and there are negative consequences as a as a function of that and that the and that both sides of that equation let's say need need a voice because both of those functions are are valuable necessary but also at odds with one another and at permanent odds because it is the case that you need hierarchies because otherwise you have nothing to do and it's also the case that if you have hierarchies then the poor will always be with you and that's a that's a that's a chronic functional problem that has to be addressed and that's the proper place I would say of the left so that's only 15 minutes so but I'm actually I'm gonna stop there I think and you can you can chew on those propositions to see what you think of those but I'm really interested actually and having a discussion with all of you and would be happy to start the question period a little earlier than might otherwise be necessary all right so thank you thank you very much please so now we'll move on to some questions I'll ask two initial questions and then open up to the audience in order to ensure that as many people as possible have a chance of asking questions so my first question is political correctness is a rather vague term that refers to a wide range of issues from preventing explicitly racist hate speech to calling out someone for wearing culturally insensitive clothes do you think that we should universally reject political correctness or is there a line that can be drawn well that was the other thing I was thinking about talking about tonight and and I'm actually having a debate in Canada about that very proposition tomorrow so here's what I've been thinking about that and trying to formulate my thoughts for my six minute initial opening remarks tomorrow is a very tight tight time constraint so think about it this way imagine that you need to describe the world in two in order to perceive the world and to act in at both of those not just to act in it but also to perceive it and that you need a description at different levels of resolution know when you can think about how you use your computer when you're when you're dealing with images you know there are some times when what you really need is a thumbnail these doesn't require much processing power and it's sufficiently representative of the reality so that you can do whatever you need to do with the image with the thumbnail and you never replace the thumbnail with a high-resolution image if if the thumbnail will do I really like that I don't think it's an analogy I actually think it's a description of a very large number of cognitive operations and maybe there's a rule of thumb which is never use a high-resolution theory when a low-resolution theory will do the converse is also true by the way so then let's say that in order to orient ourselves properly in society we need a general-purpose low resolution Theory existential theory something like that it's not precisely a description of the objective world it's more like an agreed upon and it's an agreed upon narrative about how the world is constructed in relationship to human experience and how we should act in the world so how we should look at ourselves how we should look at history how we should look at our social being so that we can coexist peacefully so that we can move forward so that our societies function and then imagine that that comes in broadly two forms and I think it does one is a collectivist form and I would say that that's that collectivist form is built very deeply into human nature it's essentially a tribal outlook it's an outlook that you can trace back hundreds of thousands of years and perhaps more deeply than that we know for example that chimpanzees have a tribal outlook and that chimpanzees will patrol the borders of their tribes looking for chimpanzees who aren't of the tribe and when they find them they will tear them into pieces and so that was that was revealed by Jane Goodall in the 1970s it was very shocking to everyone when that was when that was first discovered because there was a very influential line of thinking mostly derived from people who were influenced by Rousseau that you know human beings were innately good and that only culture made them cruel and incapable of atrocity but the fact that the chimpanzees patrolled their borders and tear apart their enemies really did that theory and in a very serious way so at least at least made it more complicated so so the collectivist view is essentially that the best way to conceptualize what a human being is is to look at what tribe they belong to and the tribe might be well this is one of the problems with the collectivist view is which of your tribal allegiances is to be paramount and that's actually a fatal problem by the way because there's an infinite number of ways you can be categorized and it isn't obvious which of those tribal allegiances should be canonical and hence the rise of intersectionality which is something that's that's a dragon that will eat its own tail certainly but there's a notion there it's like the most important thing about forget about that for a minute we'll say well the most important about thing about you is your group your gender your sex your race your ethnicity all of the multiple categories that were supposed to be considering as fundamental realities now and that the best way to construe reality is that it's a battleground between those groups for dominance power and that's the postmodern ethos and it's a pretty decent thumbnail sketch of reality you can sum it up quite quickly you can use it as a guide to action in all sorts of domains it has its consequences however and one of the consequences is that it's tribal and tribal identities tend towards mayhem now the alternative low-resolution view is the view that I think has been articulated most effectively in the West and perhaps of all the places where it's been most effectively articulated in the West the most effective articulation has come from the UK I mean there's something remarkable about what what your country has done with regards to laying out the idea of individual sovereignty in a fully articulated manner in a way that allows a political system to arise predicated on the assumption that the individual is of intrinsic value and if you need a thumbnail view of the world the most effective thumbnail view of the world isn't that you're the member of a tribe even though in many ways you are and the member of many tribes the most effective thumbnail view is that you're to be regarded as a sovereign individual and you're to treat other people that way as well both with regards to their rights but even more importantly and often forgotten with regards to their responsibilities and I think that qualities that are based on the first set of presuppositions to tribal degenerate into precisely what you'd expect which is tribal warfare and the second have the possibility of blooming into exactly what they have bloomed into which are the most functional societies the most peaceful societies the most successful societies the societies that are the best at generating wealth along with inequality that the world has ever seen and so I would say we sacrifice the latter to the former at our great peril and I would also say that and this is something that I'm very ashamed of is that the universities broadly speaking are doing absolutely everything they can as fast as they possibly can to ensure that we sacrifice the sovereign individual view for the collective tribal view and I think that is appalling beyond forgiveness and so that's what I think about political correctness all right thank you thank you as a follow-up question so your conception of truth as you said it's tailored to what helps us survive and live doesn't that also mean that your approach to the meaning of truth is very similar to one of a postmodernist which are a group of people you so clearly denounce that's a good question it's wrong but but it's a good question well look you always have to give the devil is due and the there is a central postmodern claim which arises from a very complex conundrum and the conundrum is one that emerged in domains outside of the humanities let's say although a domain it emerged in the domain of literary criticism because what happened in the mid sixties was that a very large number of disciplines simultaneously realized that it was actually technically impossible to perceive the world because there was an infinite number of ways that you could perceive the world and so that bedeviled artificial intelligence I mean people thought for a long time that it would be easy to build machines that could see the world because there was the world and there were the objects and figuring out what the objects were wasn't hard it was maneuvering in the world that was hard but that turned out to be wrong it's really really hard to figure out what the objects are and we actually don't know how we do it now you know 50 years later we have machines that can orient themselves pretty decently in the world but they had really had to be built in embodied form and I won't pursue that at the same time psychologists are working on perception ran into exactly the same conundrum because they figured out that they couldn't figure out how we could see things and and we're still sorting that out and the literary critics figured out that there was no obvious canonical interpretation for a piece of literature and that raised a specter which was well if there's no obvious canonical interpretation how do you know that when interpretation is better than the other so out of that arose the postmodern notion that there's no grand narrative there's no justifiable grand narrative there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world and there's no grand narrative fair enough but well that raises the problem of value like if there's no grant narrative how do you orient yourself in the world and the postmodern answer to that was well let's forget the complexity of that problem and sneaked our closet Marxism back into the game and that was into completely intellectually I mean I've been accused of failing to notice that there's a contradiction between post-modernism and Marxism it's like it's not like I failed to notice that it's obvious that there's a contradiction but it's equally obvious that the post modernists broadly speaking is a thumbnail sketch because they can't solve the problem of how to orient yourself in the world if there's an infinite number of interpretations rely in a completely incomprehensible and paradoxical manner on the dictates of like a defunct 19th century philosophy to provide them with motive force in the world so and that's a non tenable solution apart from being too dangerous beyond belief as the 20th century bares sufficient evidence to so now whether with regards to my conception of truth and whether it's postmodern it's like no actually it's not so and it's it's very cool it's a very complicated thing to sort out because there is more than one way of conceptualizing truth there's truth as it's manifested in ethics and there's truth as its manifested in the description let's say of the objective material world and how those two things touch is not something we've we've sorted out well in the in the ethical world what's happened is that a an ethic has evolved over time I would say and that ethic is reflected in the central axioms of civilized human behavior but you can also see deep echoes of it in animal behavior and and it seems to arise out of the fact that the the interactions that take place among paired entities that have to interact repeatedly across time follow a set pattern so one of the things that Jacque panksepp discovered for example was that if you paired rats together to engage in rough-and-tumble play bouts which you might not think is particularly relevant but actually happens to be dead relevant because that's a special circuitry and it's part of the circuitry upon which human ethics are based in if you pair them together first and one rat is bigger than the other then the big rat wins and so you think well play is dominated by power and that's how it and rats and it's a power issue but if you pair them together repeatedly which is much more naturalistic experiment what you find is that once the large rat dominates the small rat the small rat has to ask the large rat to play and if the large rat doesn't let the small rat win 30% of the time and repeated play boats then the small rat won't play anymore and you think well so what it's like no no no no not so what that's a major discovery that's like Nobel prize-winning material because what banks have demonstrated there was that there's an ethic of fair play emerges even among rats all you have to do is pair them together and there are there are rules that govern iterated ethical interactions that are emergent properties and those emergent properties are manifested as far as I can tell described in the great mythological stories that we tell in the in the great narratives that underlie our culture and they're not based on arbitrary assumptions they're based on observations of what furthered survival and reproduction to speak in a purely Darwinian manner over massive spans of time and so and to point to truth as construed in a Darwinian realm and to use the example of say iterated games to buttress that point is by no means similar in any way to participating in the same process that the deconstructionist participant artistic in so I would say well on the on the side of the postmodernist but not only the postmodernist there are an indefinite number of ways of construing the world that that's that's that's being demonstrated technically I don't think there's any debate about that but there's a very constrained number of ways that you can operate successfully in the world a very constrained number of ways and it's not it's not one way precisely because it has its its its scope of variation say across culture and across environments but it's very tightly constrained now what's happened across the course of recorded history let's say is that that ethic this is something Nietzsche observed when he was critiquing the history of Western philosophy is that ethic manifested itself first at the level of behavior we acted out we don't understand just like a chimpanzee troupe acts out the ethic of their of their hierarchy they can't represent it they can't articulate it the structure emerges the structure and the behaviors that are associated with the structure emerge before that is represented and certainly before it's articulated so first of all the ethic that governs repeated interactions at different scales of social interaction the structure emerges first and then it's mapped and its first mapped an image and story and then it's articulated and I would say well I talked earlier about the the role that England has played that the UK has played in articulating the political doctrine of the sovereign individual but the idea of the sovereign individual is far or older than those political articulations and it's based in a narrative structure that is in turn based on the observation of behavioural patterns that have emerged reliably across time and so and that's not postmodern in the least it's it's it's very straightforward claim that there is something that approximates a universal human ethic that's built deep deeply into our biological and social structures and that was constructed in no small part as a consequence of Darwinian mechanisms so thank you so now we're going to open up to the audience if you have a question please raise your hand wait for the microphone to reach you and stand up please make sure you only ask one question so for the first question we will go to the hand about the third row to the right yep wearing glasses professor Peterson in your 12 rules for life you speak very fondly of the influence of Alexander Solzhenitsyn during your formative years as a student and he also used several examples from the novels of further Dostoevsky to the straight certain points about psychology so I was just wondering is there any other way that Russian culture history has left a mark on your ideas well they aren't the only Russian thinkers who influenced me I read a lot of Tolstoy including the kingdom of God is within you Bulgakov whose Master and Margarita is I don't even know what to say about that book I've read it three times and I think I could read it another ten times it's an it's amazing it's an amazing it's an amazing tour de force I certainly don't understand it it's like a complex dream I've collected Russian Soviet art era art for a long time I got very interested in constructivist art and Suprema to start and that there was a flowering of artistic productivity in the early stages of the Soviet revolution which was pretty much clamped down on immediately by Stalin in the 1930s and so I have a real affinity for Russian thought that I don't I don't understand so so those are some of the additional influences yeah thank you very much thank you on to the next question we will go to the lady to my right thank you so much for coming to speak to us I'm a really big fan of yours and I've especially appreciated all that you've written and spoken about regarding meaning as a an antidote for chaos and nihilism and I'll preface this by saying maps for meaning is on my summer reading list so if you've already answered this question in that book please let me know but I'm wondering what you would say about what is the what's the source of meaning if it seems that lots of religions have answered that question with God but if there is no God then it seems that humans would have to kind of artificially impose meaning on the world in which case all of the meaning that we reap from the world is already given to it by us and there's no net meaning in the world or something like that so I'm wondering what you would say about where a meaning comes from hmm that's a really good question I mean so when Nietzsche announced the death of God which was a something he announced actually in sorrow and trembling I would say rather than triumphantly which is often how that's read because people actually don't read Nietzsche they just read one half of a quote from Nietzsche his his his prognostication was that we would have to become creators of our own values and then it wasn't long after that that he died and so what that meant was that any further investigations into that idea by him came to an end now not much later Freud came along and throw demonstrated quite clearly even though he doesn't get nearly as much credit for this as he should that there was no evidence whatsoever that were people were masters of their own houses and that we were the playthings of the gods in the Greek sense that we were driven perceptually and behaviorally emotionally motivationally by forces that weren't exactly under our voluntary control autonomous internal forces and you could think about those as where the gods went when they depopulated the cosmos and that was yost notion right and Jung was a very astute student of Nietzsche he gave a seminar on the first half of Nietzsche's thus spake Zarathustra that's sixteen hundred pages long and so that's an in and it's it's actually quite a dance read as well so it's not sixteen hundred pages written in crayon you know so an young sense was that Nietzsche's prognostication had to be wrong because human beings cannot create their own values we actually don't have that capacity we might be able to participate in the creation of those values but we have to come to terms with our own nature while we're doing so and I think the biological evidence for that is it's absolutely overwhelming if you don't if you don't believe that then what that means is that either you don't know anything about biology or that you've stuck your head in the sand to the point where you're unable to see now Young was very interested in how that those internal forces manifested themselves but also how they organized themselves across time okay so there's two answers to your question one is that they organize themselves into a hierarchy and there's something at the top and what he believed that what was at the talk in the West was symbolized by the figure of Christ and he thought of Christ as a symbol of the self and the self was an emergent consequence of the internal arranging of motivational States into a hierarchy partly as a consequence of of psychological activity integration maturation but also partly as a consequence of social pressure because how you organize yourself is partly a consequence of who you are and how you organize yourself but it's also partly a consequence of how other people demand that you be organized and so and I think that Jean Piaget --zz work fits very nicely into that I think that they were aiming in some sense at the same synthesis all right so with regards to so one one one one place for the derivation of meaning is the consequence of that hierarchical organization of those intrinsic motivational States into something approximating a unity that can operate properly across spans of time so the second answer to that is meaning is actually a manifestation of a very deep instinct and it's an elaboration of something the Russian neuropsychologists that's another answer to the question about the Russians I was a devotee of the Russian neuropsychologists Alexander Luria and his students Sokolov in vineger dov'è who were arguably the three greatest neuropsychologist of the last half of the 20th century and vinegared ovah and Sokolov discovered the orienting reflex which was probably the biggest discovery in psychophysiology in the last 50 years of the 20th century it's a none léa important discovery and the orienting reflex is the reflex that Orient's you towards what you don't understand it's the reflex that Orient's you towards anomaly and what that means is that you have a structure built into you to help you make sense of what you don't understand it's an actual instinct now when the orienting reflex grips you that's when you're surprised by something or startled by something that's the lowest level manifestation of the orienting reflex and it's actually part of the mechanisms that defend you against predators but that orienting reflex is and that's very low level nervous system responds very very quick very reflexive requires very little cognitive processing fast enough to have you jump out of the way of a striking snake so extraordinarily quick and dirty but like many important evolutionary adaptations it's echoed at multiple levels of the nervous system and so the orienting reflex is actually very complex as it unfolds across time and so if something startles you you might spend a year thinking about it depending on how startled you were and that entire year-long process of thinking is actually an extended manifestation of the orienting reflex and that's a deep source of meaning and so so that's like a second answer the question and a third answer to the question would be something like your hemispheres are specialized in a particular way it's a low resolution representation by the way so and and and so one of your hemispheres is specialized to operate when you know what's going on and where what you're doing is having the results you intend you can think about that is explored territory that's the left hemisphere in most people the right hemisphere is the hemisphere where the orienting reflex first manifests itself and its job is to orient you where you don't know where are things that you don't know are happening so it's also the place where imagination first takes root because imagination is part of the process by which you make sense out of what you don't understand that's where the hypotheses are generated the right hemisphere tends to think in metaphor and the left hemisphere is embedded in the metaphorical structure of the right hemisphere and that's quite well documented in the relevant neuropsychological literature from from a multitude of sources even from people who aren't concerned specifically with metaphor the sense of meaning seems to manifest itself when the the the the systems that are operating in explored territory and the systems that are operating in unexplored territory are operating optimally together so imagine that what you want to do to to adapt property to properly to life is to stay where you're adapted okay so that's a conservative approach don't go where you don't know how to act the problem with that is that things around you will change without your without your control so you you can't just stay where you are you have to be prepared for the next thing that's coming and so not only do you have to master where you are you have to master what's most likely to happen next and so you have to have one foot in chaos or in order and you have to have one foot in chaos and the way you know that that's happening optimally is that you're imbued with a sense of meaning right so it's actually the most profound part of what actually Orient's you in the real world it's not a secondary at the phenomena and that in the phenomenologist the the philosophical phenomenal just actually caught on to this in the phenomenological in their in their phenomenological work for someone like Heidegger for example meaning was the most real manifestation and I actually think that's true neurophysiological II that's how your brain operates your brain actually operates as if the most real thing is the meaning of something and the meaning is related and the really the thing about the reason for that is tied back to the Darwinian idea is that you're not a describer of the world not fundamentally you're trying to live in the world you're trying to survive in the world and propagate in the world like you have a Telos and the meaning is associated with that Tilos within that Darwinian landscape and then you say well is it real it's like it depends on what you mean by real right and and you know people say well yeah that's a postmodern answer it's like no it's not it's not at all it's because there is a conflict between the materialist view that's laid out in the Newtonian sense and the evolutionary viewpoint that's laid out in the door Willian sense and the meaning relates to what's real in the Darwinian sense not in a Newtonian sense but that doesn't mean that it's not real well it depends it depends on how you sort out your initial axioms but if you're interested in surviving and not being too miserable while you're doing so then I would suggest that you at least give some credence to the Darwinian position so that's meaning all right so for the next question we will go to the hand just that yeah don't forget those poor people up there yeah I'll take a couple question upstairs well thank you very much for your talk dr. Pierce and I say that a Cobra's was a great break but my vision as I said earlier you talk that conservatives people who temperamentally conservative always seek to preserve the hierarchy and in a kind of a healthy society and people who are temporary the liberal will always question those hierarchies is it inevitable inevitable insight inevitable then and we will slowly move in a liberal direction and there eventually those people who are liberally minded will question the very foundations of meaning and we will be in a situation where conservatives who want to budge because there's a fundamental hierarchy and liberals didn't want to stop because it's a logical progression of where they have been going well it's that's an eternal danger like this dangers on both sides one is the danger of pathological order and the other is the danger of pathological chaos and the problem with the questioning tendency is that it knows no limits and that's actually hard on people like well it's very it's actually very difficult orienting yourself in life if you happen to be very high in openness very low in conscientiousness and very high in neuroticism because you question everything and you're not stable and you might be wildly creative like that's a pretty good recipe for wild creativity but that doesn't mean that it's tenable or sustainable because most creative ideas are not only wrong they're they're actually deadly but some of them aren't some of them are absolutely vitally important right and so part of the reason we have political discussion or discussion at all is to separate the wheat from the chaff so the endless proclivity of the questioning tendency of the liberal left is that every axiom is open for infinite questioning well that leaves you bereft but the problem on the right is if you tighten things up too much well then you have no adaptive flexibility left and you're in a sterile tyranny a tyranny of stone and then the environment shifts around you and you're not prepared and then everyone's done so the reason that free speech is so important as far as I'm concerned because why don't you really think about it as free speech I think about it as what respect for the manifestation of the logos it's something like that that's the proper way of conceptualizing it is that it keeps the balance between those two tendencies right because you you need the questioning and you need the order and so you think well how much of each and the answer is the recipe changes day to day and so you think well if it changes day to day how are we going to keep up and the answer is by keeping up right here we are we're alive right we we can keep up but we do that by thinking and we think by talking and we we think and talk by disagreeing and and we better disagree conceptually because then we don't have to act out stupid ideas that will kill us right because it's so so really the abstract the abstract territory of conceptual dispute is the substitute for war and death and it can be a brutal substitute because conceptual disagreement can be very intense but compared to war and death it's hardly intense at all and so you keep the that you keep the landscape open for serious dispute including dispute that's offensive obviously because if you're ever going to talk about anything that's difficult and why talk otherwise then you're going to talk about things that are offensive to people and you're gonna do it badly you're gonna stumble around when you're formulating your thoughts and that's horrible it makes people anxious it alienates them but it's better than pain and death and that's the alternative so thank you we'll take a question from upstairs please project your voice as there will be no microphone to the lady in the block [Music] well it would be if I was trying to reduce all the individual variability to that but to note that people vary across the dimension is not necessarily simultaneously to limit all the variability to those dimensions there's lots of other variability and your question to some degree is whether the act of categorization is in itself a limitation on individual freedom I think if you push your question all the way down to the bottom and the answer to that is to some degree yes but it's also a precondition for individual freedom so is that sufficient I don't all right I would say that I perhaps I'm doing that but I don't see how that's the same as what the post modernists are doing I mean as far as I can tell the post modernists aren't saying that the group's the individuals within those groups are characterized by any stable characteristics whatsoever except for the fact of their comparative oppression like so I don't understand the first part of your argument I mean part of the reason that postmodern types have been going after me is because I I've dared to say that men and women differ in temperament which by the way they do [Applause] that that's actually something that might be worth just dip differentiating quickly because it's actually technically somewhat challenging but also very much worth knowing I was debating someone on a panel this morning on a TV show the right stuff and this is a woman who led the female the women's equality party and she cited some psychological literature that purported to claim that men and women were mostly the same and that's actually true we are more the same than different if you look at our temperaments there's more overlap than there is variance by a substantial amount and so even on the temperamental dimensions where there is most difference between men and women the difference isn't of massive magnitude at the center of the distribution so for example women are less aggressive than men which is by the way why they commit suicide to commit suicide more often but are much less lethal in their actions that's one example but there are many examples if you draw a random woman and a random man out of the population the probability that the man will be more aggressive is 60% if you bet on the man you'd win 60% of the time that's not a walloping difference it's not 95 percent of the time you know it's it's a difference that is substantive it's significant it's measurable but it's not large by the standards by which such things are judged but that's not the point the point is is that most of the activity takes place at the extremes so out on the tails of the distribution so here's an example about 9 out of 10 people in prison are male why because to be in prison you have to be the most aggressive person let's say in a hundred ok those differences at the midpoint are large enough so that if you go out to the extremes one in a hundred people you have an overwhelming preponderance of men and so you can have your cake and eat it too you can say well yeah broadly speaking men and women are more the same than different the overlap is greater than the disjunction but that not relevant if what's being selected is often at the extremes and it often is so for example with regards to engineering there's a fair bit of evidence that people who are more interested in things than in people become engineers now that's not really gonna be what is that shocking are you shocked by that you shouldn't be shocked by that right you can you can tell that not only by what engineers do but you can tell that by how they think and you can tell that just by talking to them if you know a bunch of Engineers so and it turns out that the largest temperamental difference that's known between men and women is actually interested in people versus interest in things and so it has nothing to do with competence but it has a lot to do with interest and because you have to be very interested in things to go be an engineer because that's all you're gonna be doing if you're an engineer then only those people who are extremely interested in things tend to become engineers and most of them are men and that's why even in places like Scandinavia where a tremendous amount of effort has been put into flattening the socio-cultural landscape and successfully by the way there's still a preponderance of male engineers and there's a preponderance of female nurses and no matter how much sociological gerrymandering goes along goes on those statistics have remained quite intractable over about a 15 year period and so there are differences there are differences they're not massive and then you might ask well are those socio-cultural or biological it's like well that's a hard question to answer because it depends on how much variability there is in this socio-cultural landscape because the proportion by which something is biological versus socio-cultural varies with the socio-cultural landscape that's a complicated thing to to to digest because you think of those things is fixed but they're not so but what we have demonstrated quite clearly and this is mainstream science despite the fact that people don't like it but this test has already been done so we developed a personality model that's pretty stable across cultures purely derived from statistical from statistical processes and a theoretical model if there was one and quite an unattractive model because of that conceptually but that's beside the point then we saw a cross culturally whether there were differences in that fundamental temperaments of men and women in the answer was yes cross culturally quite robust women are higher in the experience of anxiety and emotional pain and they're more compassionate and agreeable those are the big differences and they're their differences of a magnitude that I already pointed out then the next question is well to what degree is that biological versus socio-cultural and it's complicated because that very variable depends on the socio-cultural landscape but we'll put that aside you can determine that by stacking up countries from those who have done everything they possibly can to flatten out the socio-cultural landscape in relationship to gender to those who haven't that are still very stratified by sex and then what you do is you look at the magnitude of the temperament differences in keeping with the variability that those countries have in terms of their socio-cultural egalitarianism and the socio-cultural types the the social constructionist their prediction is as cultures become more egalitarian men and women become more different more the same sorry more the same because it's environmental that isn't what happens exactly the opposite happens as you flatten out the socio-cultural landscape men and women become more different the data is in the experiment is done tens of thousands of people multiple countries and it's not what anyone expected and you might think well it's all the right-wing psychologists it's like all the right-wing psychologists are in this room sitting in this chair thank you answer the next question the gentleman in glasses I just want to first thank you comments on things like political correctness and the obsession of certain elements of the lift on campuses to screen out discourse because I genuinely think that is an issue and problem stance quo but following on from there I just want to pick your thoughts and what you say about freedom of speech and discussions in general right because you basically flagged I think in your answers just then that freedom of speech has an instrumental purpose it's there to help us find truth correct me wrong to to identify the correctness or the logos against the possible consequence of blood and death so here's the question if I as an individual am affected by discourse in a way that doesn't cause physical violence so you that's not bind by hate speech laws and whatnot but makes me feel so deeply uncomfortable they don't belong to society or this community or when I say something whatever and whenever I try to say something I'm really cute because of our race the way I talk about jinda or where behave then surely that means that my valuable insight to contribute towards locals towards the pursuit of truth it shut out by other people's more vociferous speech and more dominant speech and this is what we see in cases of campuses whether it be from the right or the left of people using very violent and loud language to drown out dissent to drown out those who oppose them on campuses in society and what not from Donald Trump to people in Swarthmore we've seen this happen so wouldn't you say that the attempt to clawback or the right of freedom of speech isn't so far absolute as instrumental and based on that therefore there are some cases where freedom of speech of some individuals can be curtailed if we want to get the better appreciation of the logos and a better inclusion of more voices they're currently being shut out as a result of the extremity and radicalism of those selects for you wouldn't you say that's the case thank you there's a very simple answer to that which is yes but I'll elaborate I mean the first thing is like I'm not an admirer of hate speech laws but that doesn't mean that I'm naive enough to think that there's no such thing as hate speech so obviously if you've ever been involved in an extremely serious argument you know perfectly well there's such a thing as hate speech because you've probably uttered some so you know so and and there's there's also no doubt that there are forms of speech that are utterly reprehensible and some of those are actually already punished by law you can't incite to violence you can't libel someone right so so we have some restrictions already on what's acceptable discourse whether it's the case typically speaking that some people have more privileged access to free speech than others well that's obviously the case that's part of that's part of power and power is one of the means by which people climb hierarchies although the more you can climb a hierarchy by exercising power the more that's an indication of the fact that that hierarchy has become corrupt so there's no doubt that these structural impediments to the free exchange of discourse exist there's also no doubt as you already laid out that that's not in everyone's best interest because what you want if you have any sense in your society and this is also why I think that we've put proper emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual is that you want everyone's logos to have the opportunity to clarify the unknown and reconstitute the world and if you shut that down then you risk getting access to the unique insights that that individual might bring ok so I agree with your diagnosis completely and and I and I think that you know even even in the West to ignore the fact that many of our hierarchies tilt towards tyranny and that prejudice still exists in multiple forms is a mistake although it's only one factor among many and shouldn't be identified as the as the primary causal determinant of each individual's life I think that's that's a dreadful error the question is what do you do about it and the Devils in the details and as I said already I'm not an admirer for example of hate speech laws even though there's plenty of hateful speech because I think the best thing to do is to leave free speech alone as much as you possibly can not because that will result in the perfect conditions for free speech but because anything else that you're likely to do is going to make it worse rather than better and so that's how it looks to me very quickly so I just want to pick your brains on hate speech laws because it seems that you agreed on a pursuit of logos and logic and some sort of achievement of individualization individual autonomy that is is the end goal of discussion here right so let's assume but correct me if I'm wrong again arts the end objective here's the thing it seems I wouldn't say that exactly I wouldn't I wouldn't say that exactly I think that's I think that's too individualistic I would say that what you want is two things happening simultaneously is that you want to maximize individual development but you want to do that in a way that brings them the greatest amount of harmony simultaneously possible to the familial unit and also to the broader social unit so those things those interests have to be stacked it's like what's best for you but that's also in a manner that's best for your family and for your community so it's not purely individual so so on that basis of achieving communal harmony and individual freedom at the same time what didn't you say that there's certain problems with phrases to be or hate speech they're so vehement and so D dignifying that it disrupts both local harmony within communities but also makes individuals feel as if they can't really engage in retaliatory you know CloudFactory discourse against him because they fear the potential repercussions even if it doesn't lead to violence they just fear it so much so in my irrationally all rationally evens right so what happens happens all the time it's in fact it's the standard it's the standard situation you know if you look across the world most societies don't do a good job of either promoting or allowing free speech it's a I don't know how we ever managed it it's so unlikely because it's so it's so hard on people and I'm hard on those who occupy positions of power in tyrannical hierarchies that I can't I can't believe that any societies ever managed to figure it out at all so those dangers are always there and and and I also think the the highest likelihood often is that societies that do put high value on free speech will lose that because it's so difficult to maintain so but with regards to hate speech for example let's say that things would be much better if there was less hateful speech it's like seems highly probable to me especially if you look at the more egregious forms of hateful speech how best to regulate it well my sense is is you let those who wish to utter hateful things do so and let everyone hear them because that's the best way to ensure that what they're saying will be understood and rejected now in order to posit that you have to assume that the population composed of sovereign individuals is wiser than it is foolish and you know that's that's that's a type that that's a hope you might think about it as an axiom of faith but I do believe it to be the case I think that if you if you put the evidence in front of people by and large they will do the right thing I think that if you if you the problem with regulating hate speech it's very simple who defines hate and the answer to that is over any reasonable period of time exactly the people you would least want to have define hate and so the consequences of the regulation become incalculably worse as a problem then the problem that they were designed to deal with to think otherwise is to think in a sort of utopian manner it's like well we have a problem hate speech well we can come up with a solution and there will be no problems with that solution it's like no no no that isn't how the world works you know when I'm negotiating with my clinical clients one of the things I always tell them is often because they're in difficult circumstances and often not for psychological reasons it's like no you don't understand you're screwed both ways you don't you don't have an option here where you're not going to suffer that's that that's what it means to be in a bad situation you're gonna pay a price both ways you can pick your price okay so we're gonna have hate speech or we're gonna have the consequences of the arbitrary regulation of hate speech well I know what the consequences are of the arbitrary regulation of hate speech is that things get a lot worse because hates very difficult to define and that's actually a real problem when you're trying to regulate it because you have to be able to define it and we're already at a point where well you made someone uncomfortable why isn't that hate speech I mean I was basically asked that by one of your by one of your most outstanding journalists or your most popular journalism but why should you have the right to say something that's so offensive it's like everything we can think that true let's think that through for a minute so I mean my report to her essentially although this wasn't directly it was that's not a very smart question for a journalist to be asking right because of all people who should never ask that question will be stand-up comics right and journalists because that's all they ever do that's what it means to be a journalist is to ask a question that's going to be offensive to someone who the hell wants to hear about what you've discovered unless it's about something contentious and important so it was it was a jaw-dropping question as far as I was concerned and the fact that it was a jaw-dropping question was part of the reason why that video went viral okay so now let's think about offensiveness as part of hate okay so the first thing we might say is that you really need to think when you have a difficult problem and a difficult problem is one where there's something at stake it might be your life it might be your well-being but it's a it's it's and then we might say well there's gonna be a diversity of opinions about that particular conundrum if it actually happens to be difficult and so even to discuss it because if you discuss it you're gonna discuss option a it's gonna Vannoy all the people who want option B or you're gonna discuss your option B and that's gonna annoy all the people that want option a and maybe there's ten options so if you're gonna discuss anything of any real significance whatsoever you're gonna make people hard under the collar and you're gonna risk offending them okay so why don't you just stop talking about difficult things the answer that is yes and that's what's happening but then there's another problem which is there isn't anything I could conceivably say about anything that isn't going to offend someone if the crowd is lured large enough so you might say well if you're talking to two people you can't offend one of them so you don't get to offend 50% of the population it's like okay let's say I'm talking to a thousand people and one person finds what I'm saying offensive say well that's hateful it's like well that's one in a thousand so should I stop what if it's one in 10,000 or one in a million like where's the cutoff and you might think well we'll work that out it's like no no no no you don't get it the Devils in the details you work it out now when you formulate your restrictions on free speech you don't shunt that off into the future so that it's a problem that will be solved who defines hate insoluble problem don't regulate it because you can't define it that's how it looks to me so you have the the free marketplace of ideas so to speak where the collective can render a judgment on the acceptability of an idea on an ongoing basis and that isn't a great solution because we don't have great solutions we have partial fragmentary solutions that make us somewhat less abject ly miserable than we might be that's what we have and if we try to if we try to eradicate that kind of risk completely all we do is magnify a different kind of risk thank you so we have time for one or two more questions so next question will go to the lady just here you took on a very high level for me I pray Thanh a kind of quite ordinary got a street level and the sort of thing that really annoys me about this whole thing is for instance I was listening to any questions Friday evening and there was the Republican you know person abroad in Scotland well the audience have decided that this man can't say anything that I'm ever going to agree with so I'm going to disagree with everything he says well I disagreed with him on some things I don't like fracking but I thought some of the other things he said were quite sensible but it seems to me most people suddenly get a prejudice about a person for instance even Donald Trump who I'm not a mad fan about but one or two things he said I think quite you know not too stupid and so why can't people start talking about issues instead of sort of you know getting these sort of prejudices about people oh well you know if they're if they're on the so-called you know demonstration in London for the day of freedom oh they must be all fascists and right-wing and goodness knows what nobody actually listens to what they're saying or what they're doing they've just made up their mind and then you get your tribal warfare and that's what we're getting so much or well some of it some of it's a technical problem like people don't like it when you force them to think at high resolution and it's no wonder because look let's say you're driving your automobile along and you think this is my car and I understand it and your evidence is that as you move the steering thingy it stays on the road mm-hmm that's your understanding of your car as soon as it breaks down it's like you realize you don't understand your car at all not even a bit right and so you actually don't even perceive the car until it breaks down and then you're very unhappy that you have to perceive it because all it is is a whole nest of and you have no idea what to do with any of them and so people don't like having to think at a high resolution and so if someone says on a contentious issue well you know it's complicated and we have to differentiate it like this then you have to go through all the god-awful process of realizing that you don't have the clue what you're talking about in that circumstance and you have to evaluate all those differentiated issues it's way easier just to say well you're probably a neo-nazi and so I don't have to listen to you and and and it's it well and so that's often what people do that's particularly the case if they have a low-resolution ideology that they're trying to protect because that gives them every extra reason to do that kind of instantaneous labeling it's a very bad strategy if you're dealing with an individual one on one you know so if you're in a long-term relationship with someone and they bring up their annoyance with something that you do a very bad response to them is that well I don't have to listen to you because you're a terrible person right your relationships are gonna collapse completely if you do that every time what you want to do is differentiate the argument to the point where a solution might be generated and have have the argument at that level but it's very hard for people to do that so you end up with these radical oversimplifications that manifest themselves unfortunately in the political polarization that we see we're not going to solve our problems unless we can be a little bit more open about you know issues rather than sort of you know immediately thinking of a prejudice to say about something great which is part of the reason why I'm not a fan of political correctness because if we if we make the general diagnosis that the world is a landscaping landscape of competing power groups and and that the fundamental narrative is oppressor versus oppressed and that everything is to be viewed through that light then through that lens then we won't solve our problems we won't we'll just have a bunch of new horrible problems you see I mean I'm much older than all these people and I tend to think oh students have these ideas oh that man's homophobic so I'm not gonna listen to any other thing that he has to say you know Brendan O'Neill came here for instance you know they they just think oh that's a wrong idea so you can't possibly have any right ideas that isn't gonna help is it right not really thank you we have time for one final question so for the final question we'll go to the second round I am Canadian and we have a leader who is probably the most attempting to be the most politically correct leader in the world I'd love to hear your response if you have his ear for five minutes and could present very simply to him where he might be going wrong well I guess I would ask him to consider the possibility that his emphasis on tribal inequality might if there's any possibility that he can see any ways that that might do more harm than good because my sense is that the idea that harm might come out of that is never an idea that's even considered I certainly don't see that in our provincial government for example see I see that the the initial low resolution act of dividing people into their tribal groups in that manner as something that can do nothing but bear evil fruit in the long run and the people who do that thing know that's how we're going to rectify historical inequities it's useful if you have a theory to think through the worst possible consequences of its application right it's a good antidote to ideological possession it's like well just for a minute imagine that your theory could go spectacularly wrong what would that look like this is one of the things that's so great about the way the Americans set up their political system because it was never utopia their idea was look we're probably going to be we're probably going to be governed by half-wits who are not any smarter than we are it wasn't we're going to set up the perfect system it's like how can we ensure that if we're governed by half-wits that are no smarter than us that we won't end up in hell right and hence the balance of powers and all of those things and so and so they were very sophisticated and as good Englishmen should because they were basically good Englishmen right and well they were they were they came out they absolutely were you know I mean America's freedom is a manifestation of the deeper freedom of Great Britain anyone with any sense can see that so it's just true historically I mean maybe the Americans codified it in a in a creative manner and good for them but the fundamental traditions were already laid down they had enough humility to think through how things could go terribly wrong even if they had good intentions that's the mark of someone who's wise because it's way easier for things to go wrong than it is for them to go right and maybe it's even more important that we are careful about how things don't go terribly wrong than we are to be too concerned with making sure that they go right because hell is a long ways down and we can only make things so much better so I guess that's what I'd ask them let's just think it through we're tribal izing or tribal izing our perceptions can you think of any ways that might not work out so well and then how would you mitigate against that the wise social Simon one of the reasons that I'm a traditionalist let's say because I'm not really temperamental II suited to be a conservative despite the fact that identified myself as the only extent right-wing psychologist that was a joke primarily is because one of the things that wise social scientists know and attempt to transmit to their students is the probability that you're well-meaning Intervention say it at a clinical level or an epidemiological level will have the positive outcome you intend and no other is zero in fact the highest probability is that it will kick back against you and make things worse so you bloody well better be sure when you implement your well intentioned intervention that you lay out a measurement strategy to determine what the consequences of that intervention are because they're very unlikely to be an improvement that's especially the case if the system is already working well because if it's already at 85 percent optimal capacity moving it up another five percent is really hard whereas making it work fifty percent worse it's like any fool can manage that so when things are working be very cautious about what you do radically to fix them because you don't know what the consequence of your intervention is going to be and so that's another thing that I might suggest caution and to the degree that I'm a conservative I'm a conservative because because of my apprehension of my own ignorance it's like first do no harm that's also why in my public lectures I counsel people let's say to put their own house in order it's like you're not gonna hurt anyone by doing that right all its gonna do is make you a little less chaotic and horrible and then maybe you'll be of a little more benefit to your family that might be a nice thing too and then maybe you could dare to you know extend the tentacle out beyond that and tap something in the real world gently well that isn't what we're taught in universities we're taught that well you're 18 and you can see what's wrong and you should think of some ways of radically transforming the economic system right all right thank you I'd like to remind everyone that there's a book sale going on in the Goodman library following this talk please remain seated until we've left the chamber and please join me in thanking dr. Peterson for joining you""]"

Bernie Sanders got wooden who's here two weeks ago so so well done thanks thanks for coming along today my pleasure I'll ask a few questions and then hopefully you've got some entertaining and witty questions to ask as well so we'll get some from the audience too so I mentioned in my introduction that you're on tour at the moment and you've been spending a lot of time this year on it and that's after seven years from your previous stand-up tour what brought you back um well it I never went away it's just that it kept getting pushed back and I think the difference was I always considered stand-up as my sort of second or third job and I thought myself as a writer director and and TV shows and films sort of came first you can't you can't put a tour and then change your mind because tickets have been sold so you have to know you're not doing something for a long time and I kept doing more things and went and when you do it all yourself if you write and direct it you know three hours of TV which is what I do for a series that takes me a year you know so the office extras Derek Idiot Abroad which all two series and a special is three years work and you can't really interrupt that so it was just that I just got second place but now I don't know why but um it's number one on my list now I could I could give up TV and film to just do stand-up because I love it more than ever I don't know why I realized what a privilege it is it sort of the last bastion of self-censorship outside the novel you know what you say is what they hear there's no and interfering it's a good time it's a really good time for stand-up and I think that um I think I've probably acquired old people's rights I'm at that age where I can say what I want like you nan used to you know so yeah I've I'm absolutely loving it more than I ever did so you just said now stand ups great because there's nobody interfering and you're an obviously renowned for speaking what you think you're probably one of the most controversial comics out there do you feel in the industry today there's a real movement to be more sensitive and hold back and being afraid of offending firstly if someone says you're controversial they're only right by definition because they've said it I you know I think um you know Darwin was controversial when he came up with it you know how do the species you know I think I think people lump you in with shock comedians who try and hurt people's feelings or say things that they're you know they're like trolls and I'm not I'm always I'm always sort of doing it for a reason I you know and I've always said just cause you're offended doesn't mean you're right some people are offended by a quality so I'm never trying to offend but in this new tour it is it is about freedom of speech an offense culture and and all that but I've never considered myself I don't know I think I got that reputation from the Golden Globes maybe where I gently ribbed some of them richest most privileged beautiful people in the world and they can get but I mean if I can justify every joke I can justify and I think I think some people get offended when they mistake the subject of the joke with the actual target particularly when you're dealing with taboo subjects and I do deal with taboo subjects for a reason because I want to take the audience to that place they hadn't been before you know I want that people know that a joke about a bad thing isn't the same as the bad thing it's not even necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be aunty the bad thing it could be veiled in irony or satirical or whatever but I think I think people have to you know look look at what a joke is the real target is so I'd only say I'm controversial because I talk about controversial subjects I don't think that the content is it's funny because comedians always get asked is there anything you wouldn't joke about but journalists don't get asked is there anything you wouldn't write about and all we're doing is discussing a subject but very quickly and hopefully with a punchline so it just depends on the joke comedy comes from a good or a bad place so what looks like cruelty or you know controversy sometimes it's it's trumped-up so you know on the topic of things that journalists wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't write about and what comics would and wouldn't make fun about do you think people can effectively satirize a joke about what's going on in politics today look in the UK or the u.s. you've you know you've said a few things about the general election you've said a few things about Trump do you think that's something that people should make fun of or is it too station you can you know you can make fun of everything but you've got you you you've got um know that people have the right to be annoyed and offend didn't come back at you and make fun of you so it's not it's not whether you're allowed to it's people want to find some sort of justification but morality isn't absolute and it's in it's relative and and an offense is subjective so you know affected about feeling so you know with particular Merak or it's come down to sort of two tribes now that you're either with him or you're against him and then I try and keep politics out of comedy because I think comedy is an intellectual pursuit and as soon as you start relying on the audience agreeing with you you're suddenly rallying and I think it loses something comedic Lee you know on both sides you know I've seen I won't name it what I've seen it is a northern comic and he came out and he just said what are we gonna do about all these fucking immigrants and he got a round of applause and I just thought that's not a joke thus well I wasn't offended by I was just offended that it wasn't a joke that was the offensive bit for me it was you know you've gotta hit that so it you've got to be careful with politics that you're not just you're not just spewing your side and and I think it's very important as well in comedy if I'm going to go after anything and the I'm the butt of the joke sometimes you know and and that's fun for me that we in all my work whether it's the office or or stand up I'm usually satirizing ego and Prejudice and all those things and I often play the guy that gets it wrong fact when I started off I won a thing called the eleven o'clock show was a satirical news show I played a sort of an out-of-touch sort of right-wing bigoted boor okay you know with with heavy satire people got it and this year I'd already started writing this and because there was such a such an angry divide you know it's just suddenly on Twitter half the people had Magga in there you know and the victory of the flag and her holding a gun and and the other half were crying and I just thought and now if I do that and I sort of come down on the wrong side ironically I don't want any anyone in the room for one second to think that I'm actually like that because I didn't realize that people like that really did exist and we're proud of it and it's so funny now in the last couple of years that people think they've won something like after brexit people were out with placards saying we won go home and I was thinking what did you win you had one vote and what did what did you what do you mean you won it's such a scissor there is a strange shift in mentality there's a there's a there's a vitriol to politics it's like they're validated where they you know but I do I do try and keep out of okay comedy yeah and one thing you're good for and you you alluded to now is you're not afraid of dividing opinion you're not afraid of you know some people saying I disagree with you and some people say I agree with you is that the same thing that's become more the case as you've gone on your career and you've been more successful well again it's the if if everyone's agreeing with you you're in an echo chamber you you've just chosen you've just chosen your people to speak to so that I did a tweet the other the other week that just said this tweet is controversial and I did a poll and it came out fifty-fifty it's you know controversy is just someone saying someone that someone else doesn't agree with but I don't know really um I I'm never scared to talk about any subject but I I have to be confident that I've got something to say and what I say is fair even if that as I say veiled in irony by being unfair or stupid or so it's it's it's all a discussion it's just it's just a discussion really and I mean the important thing for me is that everyone's everyone no one has to laugh I in fact I embrace the gasps as much as the laughs because that means they were listening you know I think it's an offense is good offense makes people think it makes them think it makes them come up with another argument you've got to come up with an argument because I'm just tired of people saying I'm offended I want to say it so what that just means you're just telling me your feelings I've got a pain in my knee what do we do about it now I'm on the topic of your Twitter as looking on your Twitter page earlier I think you've got um you know over 12 12 and a half million followers spit better than the union's I think poultry 27,000 that we're on at the moment but um and through your Twitter page you talk about animal rights you talk about other issues that are important to you is that an effective medium for change is that how it is actually I know it is I mean just practically speaking years ago it would take you months and maybe years to get a hundred thousand signatures standing outside Tesco's you know for a petition and that's the magic number because that's when it gets heard in Parliament and voted on and I've been part of five six different campaigns that have got that far so it is good it does it's good to mobilize people because um there's a lot of people don't let a lot of people browse it I mean a lot of it's nonsense you know a lot of idiots on Twitter but there's a lot of idiots on the high street you've still got to go there you know so and I and my new show I do blame Twitter for the beginning of the demise of somewhat tongue-in-cheek of humanity I say I've lived through the best 50 years a humanity you know and now it's going the other way but and Twitter was the one that sort of started popularity being more important than being right you know and people have picked up symptoms of that in all walks of life because it's all about likes retweets blocked someone doesn't agree with you so you get you create your own echo chamber same as Facebook and and also started this this ridiculous myth you know we in my opinion is worth as much as your opinion now people say things like my opinion is worth as much as your facts I think was just not true it's just you know so that is a worry that is a worry in this post true theory that the more you say a lie you know the more people will take it as the truth it doesn't make it true so what do you think should happen I mean you can't ban stupid people out there are wrong people from talking know you know your course you can't and I quote I like stupid people because they make me seem clever they they bring the average down so far that they put me in like the top few percent so I wouldn't have a thing said against I mean stupidity ignorance is is the biggest danger to you money you know it really is I mean that's a very broad thing to say and but um I mean there are some incredibly stupid people in the world but as I say I'm a big fan I'm a big I'm a big fan of their numbers in their what they do to the average so I'm staying on this talk about the topic of social media you've just said it's a great opportunity to organize people get people together and probably one good byproduct of your fame is that you're able to promote causes that you care about yeah is that something you feel all celebrities to occupy that sort of following should do no I do I do I know I I never expect anyone to care as much as I do about anything and that and I don't expect then to be surprised when I don't care about their thing you know everyone everyone's everyone's different I've always done this people say you know I've always cared about animal court you just you know I suppose I had less of an audience when I was 20 or 25 no I'd do it because I can't I can't bear it I you know I I don't know why I you know it's always it's always made it's the one thing that's always sort of made my blood boil and even to the point of depression that you know that I just don't get animal cruelty I don't get it I don't get any cruelty but at least people can speak so no it's just a you know they said how I've always been I've always I've always loved nature and animals I've always fight was a privilege to have a wild animal you know or domestic but I just think it's a when I'm at home we've got a rule that the cat is asleep on our lap the other one has to get the drinks we can't disturb it I just don't want to disturb this is so lovely and peaceful and yeah and I do I do I suppose are probably over emotional over over animals so we personify them and but yeah but I've always I've always felt the way I probably I probably care more about the individual quality of an animal than animal husbandry or or or wildlife conservation in a way I just think if there's last two leopards don't put them in a cage and try and save the species let them go and okay that's the species gone but you know I worry about the the rights of the individual animal great well um so moving on to a different topic I mentioned in my introduction you know the office is being remade I think six or seven times now we met year local Remax yeah I think the last one just happened it's not out yet I think it's a finished version but the you know when you first came up with the script and the idea that was over you know 15 years ago do you think it's a show that would be commissioned today do you think humors in the same place would be commissioned then if if I had made my own little demo of it because if you think about it it doesn't jump off the page you know middle-aged man says a joke that no one laughs at looks at the camera touch his tie it's I think I think comedies you know to be performed you know so I had to show them what I meant and it way and it was a it was a slightly different show because it was about it was about because it was steeped in realism it was a fake documentary so I had to be real so did the the dialogue so did the you know characterization and the way we speak was a lot of its nonverbal we stopped halfway through a sense we go um um we use our hands we we look around we don't look at the person we look at our feet when we're lying so it had to be seen because on the page you couldn't tell what sort of person David Brent was it's how he acts and why he acts you know he if that had been a straightforward sitcom that wasn't effect documentary it's been nothing but when you realize he's showing off because he thinks he's going to be discovered well it brings it to life now he's a now he's a man baby narcissist but but an early prototype not nothing nothing on Trump you know he's he's he put David Brent to shame so that and that's what the the movie life on the road it's all looked into is how the world's changed in those 15 years and you know he's an early sort of reality star and by today's standards he's he's hasn't got the power nowadays because it's since then we've had things like The Apprentice where people get on it by saying I would destroy anyone who stands in my way and people go in Big Brother and they they promise that they're they're behaved badly and I just think there's this it's an odd thing now that there's no difference between Fame and infamy people do bad things to be famous and they get rewarded for it there's people that do nothing to be famous they just they just live their life like an open wound and they're rewarded for it I mean a think that's reward you know and people some people use it as therapy how often have you seen like a a celebrity who's fallen from grace often through no fault of their own but they go into Celebrity Big Brother and they say I want to show the public a different side of me I'm thinking why do you care they want you to fight again you're that you know this isn't this isn't good for you so when it's yes it's it's it's all it's all come together that that reality that that bravado that machismo the bragging about how ruthless you are in business and it's very hard do you think we have a warped sense of reality now given the abundance of all these different reality programs that are out there and people who are who are allegedly ordinary people gay on TV and saying ridiculous things in this circulating all over the Internet and all across well it's not even reality anymore isn't it because it's so contrived you know that they've now they condense it now they contrived situations there's there's no real there's no real reality shows anymore if it's bit pure it's it it's aimed to appeal to our sort of voyeuristic tendencies and we're all well guilty you know from you know X Factor when they in the preliminary rounds they weird out the mentally ill to be sniggered out by you know millionaires we're a part of that are people having proper nervous breakdowns in Big Brother we're all part of that and you know that's what drama is when it's when it's real it's conflict we don't want to watch 12 people sitting around having a nice conversation we want a fist fight if we're gonna you know that's so it does appeal it sort of appeals to the the worst of our instincts I think earlier we touched the idea of you know ego and Prejudice you said this is something you interested in exploring your toenails called humanity and I think that probably sums up lots of your different work but for film and TV looking at people's stories their lives and their egos turning to yourself rather than any character you've written or played do you feel fulfilled with what you're doing today is there some other big challenge or big project you'd like to take on and give you more fulfillment I don't know I've never I've just always got up in the morning and wanted to fill the day with as much fun as possible you know I suppose that's everything I've done is sort of slightly existential as well and from the office it's about you know people becoming 14 are they doing the right thing Derek it was about people at the end of their life what what can they pass on even my children but flanimals was about the sort of futility of life and nature and ironic deaths and I don't know why that is really I think it's funny I think it's funny life I think is it's it's amusing because we take everything so seriously we care about everything passionately we have fights Wars worry about little things and then we die and the North effer and there's nothing it was pointless pointless we would turn we would tend to the stars so I've always thought I want to fill my days with fun and if the end was tomorrow we'd be happy oh well hopefully not but no no but um you know as I often sign off on Facebook I've to my and Twitter I sign off I hope you die in your sleep and that's the nicest thing I can say to anyone I hope you die in a state if someone said find you if if we all died in our sleep I wouldn't care about anything do you know oh there'd be nothing to worry about because that's what we worry about we don't worry about not existing we worry about oh my god am I gonna be I'm not gonna be squashed by a safe and be on this street and am I gonna fall on a spike is it gonna be a long lingering death am I going to be eaten by wolves well I suppose said no you're gonna die in your sleep drunk I'll go bring it on well I'm on that uplifting note let's get a few questions from the audience if you'd like to ask a question and please raise your hand if you're selected wait for the microphone to reach you before asking your question is any one particular you'd like to pick oh sorry was that one where well I did somebody but oh no I know I don't want this is oh this is horrible I don't want to well I'll find some of this right the person over there towards the front third row can you see the karl Pilkington radio shows coming back any time the thing is with that is a people gasping and I do miss it and I and I even now and again listen to some of the old ones though everyone hear that question it's Karl Pilkington's our podcast coming back and I don't think it would work I think I think Karl became my little public experiment it was like a cross between stiff Elsa unscripted it was unscripted and that was that is that is that is real it was it was unscripted but it was it where he was like my little experiment I like a cross between I don't know have you seen the film lawnmower man it was like okay um cracking reference to anyone who has but I always thought that car was like I'd found I found him a ten thousand year old caveman and shaved it thawed it out put clothes on it and then tried to teach it sort of art and philosophy and science and I think because he had a good brain I kept telling my said you've got a good brain you've got a brain you just don't use it right and you know he just he just he just found he found things that interested him which was furious and often apocryphal or nonsense just things on the internet you know baby baby born half monkey half as well it's not true Karl it's not true you go look at him I go it's just a hairy kid he's a hairy kid he's a hair is a hundred percent human he's got a lot of hair says here he's half monkey it doesn't matter what it says their car it's not half monkey so but I think he I think he became sort of a little bit more worldly wise it's that chemistry that you guys captured in that show it's hard to replicate that kind of chemistry oh you couldn't you couldn't contrive it it was it I discovered him he opened his little slackjaw once and he said something and I just I just my ears went up like that and I just thought this guy's interesting it's like I found him under a rock so I I don't think it would be the same I don't think he's that he's sort of retired now it doesn't matter how many times I very listen to it it's still it's still gotten its its I I listen to about people send me tweets of like clips and I'd completely forgotten about them but um it's like the first time he heard about something that I might introduce a concept to him and it's the first time here and I can hear his brain working it's like a silence where you know it's a things to me like like childlike it it's a things why they said he said what's the most amazing fact ever oh cool what do you mean he went they said tell me something that'll blow me mind I said I said well the night room infinite is pretty amazing I said okay is well I said there was many even numbers as even an odd numbers put together he went no I told him I told him the theory that the you know the model of infinity and the infinite amount of chimps working on typewriters would write the computer Shakespeare he wouldn't have thought he'd said if they read Shakespeare I went that's nothing I said that's the that's nothing to do with it right Eve god I just don't think they'd do that I don't know they know take out cognitive reason that there's no choice they've chosen monkeys to take out choice in the reasons they're just hitting away like that and he just couldn't get it he couldn't get that it was a yeah but so I I think he's learned his lesson and I think he's sort of content I just don't think it would work now well Thank You Ricky thank you let's have another question from let's go to the hand over there and the the bright blue t-shirt hi Ricky thanks so much for coming I wanted to ask as a kind of aspiring comedian myself you've had a really interesting background I remember in an interview or a video with Chris Rock Seinfeld and Louie CK talking about how you had a bizarre route into comedy because you wrote this may be the best sitcom ever and then years later did stand-up what advice would you have to aspiring comedians secondly very quickly would you ever are you going to work with Stephen Merchant again because I really miss all those projects you did with him I thought they were amazing and finally do you do you ever read the Facebook comments and if so you tempted to reply to them right okay okay what was the first one that's not good right yeah um right I'd say well no it's funny because I've sort of quite that's true when I am so I got into comedy I was already a comedian before I sort of decided I'd become comedian he just sort of happened I went on the radio show and I and I was meant to be the head of speech I have a normal job I worked in an office for ten years which is what I based the office on and then I got a job in a radio station and I was meant to go in and and sort of be writing little things for the DJ's and because I'm so lazy I thought I'll just do this myself so I went in I popped up I did funny things and you know and then the bosses said listen you're you're rubbish at your real job so just do that and and it grew and I became like the the comedy turn on XFM got discovered by Channel four and all that so by the time I did stand-up I did think oh I should do that and I went along and my first four stand-up shows I sort of wrote over I wrote them like I was doing you know like an Edinburgh show or almost like a TV lecture and then I went out and I did it and it was fine this one I've cracked it I did it differently III feel that I think I walked out with a few things on the back of my hand I didn't use multimedia I didn't use you know any structure and I just talked and I feel that I'm a stand-up for the first time I feel that this tour I can say I'm a stand-up and the first four tours I was in the ballpark so I'd say and here's another revelation that shouldn't be a revelation it should be obvious stage time is everything you can you can write and write and write and it can be pretty funny and they can laugh but if you do the stage time you it's it's actually doing it I I can't think of an analogy there's nothing like it other than okay you could you could learn about making pots on a pot as well in theory you could learn if you can watch YouTube is you could be an expert and until you put your hands on it you know these are you know I think that's it you've got it's stage time and our stage time is worth 50 hours writing if you if you haven't done it yet it's stage time it's just doing it doing it you know and if you can do it if you could do it every night um you know you might be you might be getting and it depends what you mean by good do you mean good you're good and it works every night to 15 people or do you mean I'm good because I'm making money now and I'm famous and everyone loves me I mean the latter yeah well then there's a whole lot of luck as well then my okay is my advice work hard and be lucky but I just think I think you have a passion for it you've got have a voice you got to find your voice how old do you 23 see 23 right you're young handsome what do you want to be a comedian for fuck you great ok another question then please let's go to the as a hand directly behind on the second row with the glasses hi with the adaption of the British office for American audiences do you think that the humor was also adapted and what do you think the difference is if you think there is a difference at all between British and American humor ok I've thought about this a lot ok um doesn't mean I'm right but I I've got a good answer um well there's there's no real difference in humor right humor you know everyone's different within their own what they find funny but humor is just about the same it's it's it's it's what we all have and what we all use I think we mean when we say humor we mean comedy is American comedy different - because we're all the same we're you know with outside cultural reference you know I think and and and before I got onto the office even just doing stand-up people think it must be so what do you change to do go to America I don't change anything I don't change I don't change tap to force it or pavement decide what they know what I'm talking about you know I don't talk about last night's big brother winner I don't you know but when you're deed I try and deal in sort of Universal subjects and outside you know language barriers the people and people are the same there's dumb people and they're smart people that's the big difference that's the only difference in dumb and smart right now I'm but the difference between American comedy and English comedy I think was highlighted in the difference between the English and the American office and that is in Britain we we like the underdog we love the underdog we we we have a until they're not the underdog anymore then we don't like them anymore but we celebrate we celebrate and we laugh and almost embrace failure whereas Americans that they're there it's a myth that Americans don't get already this doesn't that's ridiculous it total myth right but they don't use it all the time like we do to British guys meet they go or nice haircut they can't they can't they can't say oh you look good mate okay they go what's up with you what what what that it would blow our minds we're as Americans that they're not Americans aren't afraid of sincerity you know and I think that that's the difference because David Brent was so sort of bad at his job an awful when it was so sort of depressing that American audience couldn't they couldn't they wouldn't have quite taken that I think so we had to make Steve Carell a little bit nice and more positive possibly better at his job a little bit better looking but not too much because that is the truth and and and it comes down to expectations and optimism and and all that because Americans are brought up and you know better than me but I feel that Americans are brought up to believe they can be the next president United States British people have told it won't happen to you so don't bother and I think that that is a it's raining you know so I think I think that is the big difference that's the only thing like an eye can see and and then when we're talking about the industry it's very different the amount of right is the amount of money that that makes a big difference with what gets on television and stuff but but but that's not that's not to do with what you asked I don't think but I think I think pretty people are pretty much the same wherever you go if you if you're not being shot at and your firstborn isn't dying of dysentery you know we worry about the same things we worry about what's happening what's happening in our world you know you I've seen it all the time if you if you you're watching the television and the news was a country it just sunk right you'd go all Mike you didn't get any milk you know you we bring it back you always bring it back to you and people of us that that's the same anywhere great thank you let's go to the hand at the very back on the end of row hi Ricky just wanna say I'm a massive fan of all of your work but also in particular extras that's definitely my favorite thank you I just want to know if you obviously I'm not expecting it's going to make a resurgence or anything like that but if it were to or or if you know at the time one of the celebrities had said no is there any celebrity or particular type of celebrity that you'd have liked to have caricatured that you didn't get the opportunity to or even maybe in the modern climate is there anyone new that you would like to caricature as well it'd be difficult now because everyone does it now every everyone when you know TV is now reduced to what two minute clip gets on YouTube for hits the next day everyone's done it you know you there's I mean when the president United States is getting into Twitter fights with reality stars you know society is crumbled so I you know we used to take what's we used to take really dignified people and break them down like you know Shakespearean actors or you know but now who's left you know I mean we don't mother trays are doing carpool karaoke if she was alive now so I don't I don't know if extras would I don't know what I don't know what extras would have to do to satirize what's happening do you not I mean it would be it was like a quaint time then it was like people would go oh look David Bowie pretending to be well that that what the real presidents doing you know so III just I don't think it would have legs I don't know I don't know what who you'd have to who's left you know Obama did you know comedians getting coffee and cars with Jerry Seinfeld you know yeah I think that was of its time and it's only ten years old look what's happened in ten years what's next so when although I do miss it I did I really enjoy it but I enjoyed I mean I did enjoy you know working with my heroes and having fun with those people and deconstructing Fame but the thing I enjoyed most about it is the is like Andy and Maggie's relationship I like the real characters that they were and that's why I made it extras and not actors because I think had to be people on the bottom rung watching looking at this mad world and I think you always have to do that with comedy I think you I think you have to there has to be a hill to climb so I am I I just don't I don't think there's any place to go now with celebrities and also they're so in on it now they realize now it's like oh if I do that then people will think I'm not really like that that there was so that there to everyone's to willing to do anything to be on telly for a minute that's the problem we have you know I just think people are told oh this will get 50 million YouTube hits I don't know who's saying no anymore I don't know who's saying no who are these people that you know that David Bao is great because it was the only thing he ever he ever did was the last thing he did you know that that now that's special but now you know people go on American chat shows and to show a clip they pay ping they play ping pong you know in masks or throw custard pies at each other it's like okay why are we watching there's no interviews anymore don't know why they're called chat shows anymore there's no chat it's just a game so well maybe I should bring it back just to be angry I think we've got time for two more questions so let's go to the hand in the middle over there the white t-shirt I'll answer faster than we can get everyone who wants to ask question okay um because you haven't been Umbra Hollister per I sort of feel we need to ask would you rather date a man who was a six-foot penis or would you rather date a man who instead of a penis had another tiny man the six-foot penis right he is basically a six-foot penis but he can talk you'd sort of free to interpret what sort of questions that I'm asking you you could you can't you can't come up with a question and then back out you haven't thought it through so it's a six foot he's a six foot penis who what walks along on testicles presumably right if not in now he's only get away with anything here right so so it hasn't got a face so he has got a face and so you could have like a little face on the helmet right right and he's got clothing and just his hound wit coming out of his suit and tie okay right yeah and and the other the other guy is he's a normal person except that instead of having a penis he has a little man and there's this little man at his own little man do I have to worry about him as well what he wants to eat and drink well like sure lead one at least like converse with him or know it well not in the restaurant that is still that is still his penis it just happens to look like a little man so okay so I think I'm why am I going out with men anyway we could reverse it it's a six foot Volvo [Music] stick to the man I want stick to the original question okay right a six-foot penis remember I was saying the world's changed did you ask Arafat this I'd listen I I can't be seen walking down the street with a six-foot penis so I'm gonna go that and no one needs to know that my new boyfriend for some reason has got another little boyfriend in his trousers okay let's move on Oh how was the ultimate union Wow yes Eric thank for your talk today I was just gonna mention that I was quite me as that you said you don't bring politics into your comedy when you did a stand-up show entitled politics yeah I was gonna say you're in Oxford at the moment in case you didn't know and now by the question an Oxford and Cambridge have produced some really you know like really good comedians and growing out concerns Stephen Fry and a whole host of others you went to UCL yourself I wonder do you think you need to be clever to be funny is there a certain amount of intelligence required for comedy well I don't know would the answer's no you don't need to be intelligent to be funny because there's lots of types of funny isn't there so but if you're talking about you know a stand-up comedian having something to say and making people think as well then I think you certainly have to be analytical and I think you have to have an angle so you're later to have to thought something out and I think you have to have a certain amount of fairness as well I think the I'm very I try and make my jokes I try and make the targets fair III don't joke about things that people can't help I joke about people's behavior often or and that's just that's just personal and I also think that it is it it is a bonus if you can make people think as well as laughs because a lot laughs easy I could fall over and you'd laugh right thanks a lot in fact one of you would film it for YouTube I imagine him or and 250 pounds for so I I think that um comedy is best probably is is clever but then there's something very nice and visceral and you know it is funny to see someone fall over you know I mean that I'm sort of metaphorically but you know IIIi love Lauren Hardy and what was nice about them was the the sort of relationship that was so precarious and there we were laughing their situation to pretension of one and the the guy who didn't care but the guy didn't care the pretentious guy who thought that he was cleverer than the other one he always ended up down you know face down in the duck pond so I think if you analyze most comedy there's there's there's something clever in it there's another layer as opposed to it just looking at YouTube clips of people falling down cellars which are hilarious by the way well I was just gonna say the reason I asked that question because you were talking about karl Pilkington and like I don't know if you would say that he's a clever man but he was certainly incredibly funny he was incredibly funny but it was attitude that was funny and if you took it by himself there was still the relationship it still needed a couple of pretentious media types thinking they were winning but they were losing because he didn't care what we thought so there was still a little bit of a dynamic going on not just if karl Pilkington went on the radio and said all right world is what I think monkeys in that people go wise I spoke to her but because he was goaded by a couple of pseudo-intellectual media types thinking that they were embarrassing in it there became there became a texture to it and people wanted him to win people loved him winning winning was maybe making me laugh or being proved right first something that you know so there's still there was still something going on it wasn't just it wasn't just a man saying stupid things so yeah does that make sense yeah I think so thank you very much okay let's take one final super quick bonus question so these two when I choose one sorry yeah wait for the microphone okay I don't want the responsibility thank you I was wondering about your relationship with Stephen Merchant and how the creative process changes when you're working with a partner versus well um very quickly with any collaboration I've worked with Steve I've worked with Matt Robinson I've worked with David Koepp and I always had one rule which is let me get my own way or I'm sulking and one veto and it's out so what you don't do is you don't you never come in with two different scripts and and and then fight for you you work on something and if one of you doesn't like something it doesn't go in because you don't want to be left with anything that one of you doesn't like so often you might throw out you might throw out 90% of the stuff right but the bit that's left you both love but other than that there's loads of ways to collaborate you know team right in you know I think the best idea wins I think that's that's what it comes down to but if you're if you're any sort of an outer then you sort of you sort of want to do it your way all the time so there's there's always a compromise with with one other person there to other people and two heads are better than one but I always think that the trouble I have with collaboration is it doesn't feel like you know with team writing there's less fun in it for me I like the day but I don't like doing things that won't come but I won't come didn't completely come up with all love it's a difficult thing to say and I do it because it's fun coming up with stuff so if I was in a room and I was you know a tractor host and I had all these writers and they came up with everything for me I wouldn't enjoy that because the bit that's missing was the fun of me coming up with stuff does that make sense that's the buzz for me having an idea that's my adrenaline rush and then and then trying to not ruin it so just walking into a room and getting the script and then read nor OQ at that but that means nothing to me and it could be great and some people love it and it could be lucrative but I feel that even it into a certain degree I don't love as much as coming up with the with the stuff so I just think it depends on what sort of person you are I think I'm an egomaniac great well unfortunately that's all we've got time for but thank you so much for coming along today it's a great way for every end there to thank you and if you could please remain seated while Ricky leaves the room but join me in thanking Ricky for coming along today you""]"
21,0,Indian Election Update | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix,"On this segment from the latest episode of Patriot Act, Hasan examines the results of the recent 17th Lok Sabha election in which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP party maintained their control in a landslide victory throughout the country. After analyzing the state of Indian politics in the lead up to the election on a previous episode, Hasan takes a look at exactly how the BJP managed to pull off such a lopsided win and what it says about Modi’s agenda for the largest democracy in the world.Watch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931 #Netflix #PatriotAct #HasanMinhajSubscribe: https://bit.ly/2OHQXpOAbout Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj:New episodes, new topics, every Sunday - only on Netflix.

Modi, Modi, Modi. I told you.\nI said, ""Don\'t do Indian elections."" Why can\'t I talk about Indian politics?\nI\'m Indian. You\'re Indian? You didn\'t even live there. How do you call yourself an Indian? My family\'s from there. People think that you\'re American.\nYou\'re a white washed. No, I\'m not. You know me\nand uncle are brown, you know that. How? But you don\'t behave like a brown. -What does that even mean?\n-You think that you\'re a smart white dude. Sorry, you\'re not. If you don\'t want me\nto talk about politics, -what do you want me to talk about?\n-Go ahead with Bollywood. -I\'m not talking about Bollywood.\n-You should. -I\'m not talking about Bollywood.\n-No, Indian food. -The spicy Indian food.\n-Oh, yeah. Biryani. -You want me to do 26 minutes...\n-Oh, yes. on biryani? Yeah, you can do an hour. You could do an hour. Okay. What if I just do the update\non what happened? -Apology is the only update you can give.\n-Only update you can do. Maybe you can put it as... ""Patriot Act:\nApology Regarding Indian Elections."" You want me to do ""Patriot Act:\nApology About Indian Elections?"" -Yes.\n-""Sorry, I Didn\'t Listen."" Hello. Thank you so much! Thank you. Hello, how are you? Hi! Welcome to Patriot Act. I\'m Hasan Minhaj.\nThank you guys so much for coming out. Oh, man. Now, look. India just wrapped up\nits general election, and we have to talk about it. I mean, can you imagine if we didn\'t? Like every white person would be like,\n""Is Hasan okay?"" And every Indian person would be like,\n""Good, he learned."" So here\'s a quick update. This election\npretty much came down to two parties. The BJP,\na right-wing Hindu Nationalist group led by incumbent Prime Minister,\nNarendra Modi, and the Congress Party,\nled by Rahul Gandhi. And the results were stunning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\nis celebrating a sweeping victory Narendra Modi now set for\na second five-year term as prime minister of the world\'s biggest democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, India has spoken, and India has spoken decisively. Okay, that\'s Navika Kumar, and we featured her the last time\nwe talked about the elections. So she hit me up on Twitter and invited me to come on her show\nfor a debate. And I said... ""Hell no."" \nThat show is way too intense. I would get destroyed like King\'s Landing. Make your point! All right, make your point! Respond to the basic issues. Can you just calm down? Why are you getting personal? I think you suffer from amnesia. Stop playing the victim card. You did not make\nthe political point that you should have. Do they just slap everyone\nright before they put them on air? Also, how do they fit so many people\non that show? It\'s like they mapped the population\nof India onto their news shows. Now, look. We know this. It\'s not a huge surprise\nthat the BJP won. It was the size of their victory\nthat was shocking. Modi\'s BJP Party won 303 out of 542 seats in the lower House of Parliament.\nIt\'s well beyond the simple majority a party in India needs\nto form a government. The BJP took so many seats, they won a majority on their own. They pulled it off\nby expanding beyond the Hindi Belt, which sounds like something\nGucci got in trouble for selling. But... the Hindi Belt is actually a region that\'s made up entirely\nof Hindi-speaking states. In this election,\nthe BJP managed to expand into every part of India. They are now 56%\nof the lower House of Parliament. Meanwhile, the Congress Party ended\nthis election with 52 seats. That\'s not even 10% of the lower house. And if you think things couldn\'t get\nany worse for Rahul Gandhi, you\'re very wrong. And one of the highlights\nof the BJP\'s amazing victory is Amethi, where the party\'s Smriti Irani\ndefeated Congress President Rahul Gandhi. An event that has led\nto even more humiliation for the congress. I would like to say Smriti Irani has won. I want to congratulate her.\nThe citizens of a Amethi have decided. I respect their decision. Okay, Rahul couldn\'t even win\nhis own district, which his family held for decades. He lost to a BJP candidate\nnamed Smriti Irani, who\'s a former soap opera star. And trust me, she does not fuck around. Okay, why did they film this entire show\non Google Street View? It feels like the director\nis like, ""Wait. I\'m just looking for a brunch spot.\nLet me just... let me just get my Matrix on."" Killing the competition\nisn\'t just a metaphor. The BJP ran some wild candidates. Like Anantkumar Hegde who said, ""As long as we have Islam in the world,\nthere will be no end to terrorism,"" which kind of sounds like\nStephen Miller\'s wedding vows. Or Sakshi Maharaj, who has\n34 criminal cases against him, including robbery and murder, but by far the craziest BJP candidate\nwas Pragya Thakur, who won in Bhopal. Now, she recently pissed off\npretty much all of India. Sadhvi Pragya has proved to be\nthe biggest embarrassment for the BJP. She has called Mahatma Gandhi\'s assassin\na patriot. You can\'t say that. That\'s like calling Ted Bundy\na ladies man. Now, Pragya eventually apologized. But this isn\'t the first time she\'s run\ninto trouble. Last year, a terrorism charge\nwas laid against her as a suspect in a 2008 mosque bombing\nthat killed six people. Visiting a Bhopal Hindu temple\nfor a cleansing ceremony, she adamantly maintains her innocence\nin the case. I am 100% innocent. Okay, technically... Pragya is out on bail\nbecause she has cancer. But she\'s also been accused\nof plotting a deadly bomb attack. So, I just don\'t know how to do this joke. You know what I mean?\n\'Cause, like, what was her Make-A-Wish? You know what I mean? They were like,\n""Hey, do you want to meet The Rock?"" And then she was like,\n""Can he help me blow up a mosque?"" I told you it was fucked up. Now look, it\'s easy to reduce\nthe BJP\'s popularity to one issue, whether you look Pragya\nand think Hindu nationalism or you look at Congress and you think\nof corruption and incompetence. But don\'t forget one\nof the biggest reasons the BJP won is Narendra Modi himself. Voters wanted him\nto be the face of India. So even though he\'s known\nfor not taking questions from the press, the stakes of this election were so high,\neven he had to sit down for an interview with one of the most feared journalists\nin India, Bollywood star Akshay Kumar. The fashion statement you make\nis very interesting. Have you styled it yourself? This is a good question. I want to know if you eat mangoes. I eat mangoes,\nand I enjoy it very much. Okay, that sounds like a five-year-old\ninterviewing their doll. Akshay\'s like, ""Do you like mangoes? I like mangoes. Would you like some more tea?"" He\'s so charming, I almost forgot\nabout the Rafale scandal. Now, I totally get why Indians love Modi. He\'s so Indian.\nThe day before voting ended, he climbed the Himalayan Mountains\nand meditated in a shrine for 18 hours. He basically did what Americans think\nIndians do all the time. Look, you may not agree with his politics,\nbut the man knows a good photo op. He\'s like, ""Look, I want to meditate.\nGet the cameras ready."" THERE\'S-- FUCK-- THIS IS A THREE CAMERA SHOOT! Look what they\'re cutting. They had to cut wide on the walk.\nThey\'re getting his lineup. They got his lineup! We have multiple angles inside\nof a cave, you guys. The point is Modi is savvy and revered, and I know this because Indian trolls\nare blowing up my mentions. They don\'t like my sweater.\nThey don\'t like my hand motions. This person just wants me to know\nthat I\'m a son of a bitch. I love how he wrote, ""Just so you know."" He\'s like, ""Hey, just FYI. You\'re a son of a bitch."" But I picked up on a general theme. Modi supporters think I was trying\nto swing the election. ""Let me take this time\nto thank Hasan Minhaj, who helped us elect\na right-wing government in India. Thank you."" Okay, let me make this very clear. Comedians can\'t swing elections. This is insane. George W. Bush won twice\nwhen Jon Stewart  was on the air. We\'re talking peak Stewart, you guys. He had black hair.\nHe had the shoulder pads. He took down Crossfire. Everyone was like,\n""I get my news from J-Stew. He\'s the truth-teller."" Meanwhile, Bush went back-to-back.\nComedians don\'t do shit. But... I can\'t go online without Desi trolls telling me\nI ruined democracy. So clearly,\nI didn\'t need to go to Navika\'s show. Navika\'s show came to me. I think he made Modi win. Why is he talking about\nIndian politics anyway? He has no clue about Narendra Modi.\nHe has no clue about BJP. This guy\'s an anti-Indian. You are my least favorite\nDaily Show correspondent. -Not funny.\n-Excuse me. That is not the point.\nCan I make my point? -Can I make my point?\n-Make your point! It\'s only Modi, Modi, Modi for him. I tried to tell him not\nto talk about this, and he never listened to me. He\'s a complete idiot and a buffoon. Why are you getting personal? Why are you getting personal? I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry. Let\'s not get personal. Hasan Minhaj is a son of a bitch!']"
22,0,Cricket Corruption | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix,"On the latest episode of Patriot Act, Hasan takes a look at the history and politics behind one of the biggest sports in the world: cricket. With billions of fans scheduled to tune into the upcoming 2019 Cricket World Cup, Hasan examines how the game has evolved from a sport of British colonizers into a tool of diplomacy and a force for good despite recent scandals and corruption. Hasan also explores how cricket has especially grown in India due in part to the creation of the IPL, a flashy professional cricket league founded by the infamous Lalit Modi, and how that expansion has unfortunately come at the expense of the growth of cricket in other countries.Watch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931 #Netflix #PatriotAct #HasanMinhajSubscribe: https://bit.ly/2OHQXpOAbout Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj:New episodes, new topics, every Sunday - only on Netflix.

Not the spelling bee... Cricket.\nNow, growing up I hated watching cricket. Imagine sitting on the couch with your dad\nfor a week and watching this. Just before lunch. Eleven minutes to go. Boycott bowled in sweater\nand cap on Wednesday and it looks as though\nhe\'ll do the same thing today. Slight delays out there\nwhilst the England bowlers are not entirely happy with the ball. That live action Brooks Brothers catalog goes on for five days. But now, the game has gone\nfrom sweater vests and tea breaks to something that\'s actually fun to watch. This week, the 2019 Cricket World Cup\nkicks off in England, and that\'s a big deal\nfor fans around the world. India! India! ♪ India, India! ♪ Pakistan! Barmy army! Barmy army! We win baby, yeah! Oh, incredible! Okay, that guy who looks like\nLittle Richard fucked a minion perfectly captures ""cricket mania."" Now just for perspective, the last time\nIndia and Pakistan played each other in the World Cup,\nover a billion people tuned in. In terms of viewers,\nthat\'s nine Super Bowls, 52 Game of Thrones finales or a billion Murphy Brown reboots. Nobody watched Murphy Brown, I\'m sorry. And yet, when Americans hear\nthe word ""cricket,"" they think of the insect, the cola, or the data plan you get\nif you want to start selling cocaine. But cricket\nis so much more than you think. Cricket can be used\nfor international diplomacy, aka, ""cricket diplomacy."" India and Pakistan have used cricket\nto both ease tensions and inflame tensions. After the terrorist attacks in Kashmir, India reportedly threatened to boycott\nits match with Pakistan. But ""cricket diplomacy""\ngoes way beyond South Asia. In the early 2000s, Fidel Castro tried to get Cubans\nto play cricket instead of baseball\nas a middle finger to the United States. In 2005, China built Grenada\na cricket stadium as a thank you for not recognizing Taiwan. Cricket has even played a vital role\nin Afghanistan. You guys remember Afghanistan, right? You know, from war. Minus cricket, we are nothing. Because when we were young,\nwe played only cricket. Psychologically, cricket takes their mind\naway from bad things. People won\'t participate in elections,\nbut they will in cricket. It has become essential\nto the Afghan people. That\'s incredible. Even American politicians recognize\ncricket\'s international importance. If we are searching for a model\nof how to meet tough international challenges\nwith skill, we need only look\nto the Afghan national cricket team. Afghanistan did not even have\na cricket team a decade ago and last month the team made it\nto the World 20 Championships. You know what\'s weird? She gave that exact same speech\nat Goldman Sachs for $200,000. Look, bankers love cricket, too. Cricket is a global sport\nwith the potential to unite nations. But here\'s what\'s frustrating. In 2019, cricket is becoming\nless inclusive because of corruption and greed, and no country is more\nto blame than India. India has become so dominant it is stifling the growth\nof international cricket, which is odd because the goal\nwas originally about expansion. The game was spread by the British Empire, the world\'s first spam bot.\nThey took cricket everywhere. India, Sri Lanka, the West Indies,\nthey even spread cricket to prison. Yes, England straight-up built\na continent-sized jail and called it Australia. They took cricket to Canada,\neven the American colonies. America used to play cricket,\nbut then the United States was like, ""Yo, fuck your sport. Fuck your tea. fuck your pronunciation\nof the word privacy, aluminum and take us off your schedule. Cheerio."" And then, Americans took their slaves\nand created baseball. The Empire spread cricket\nall over the world, and they used cricket\nas a way to export their culture and civilize the locals. Cricket has been called\nthe ultimate colonial ""civilizer,"" which is basically Winston Churchill\'s\nversion of Grand Theft Auto. It\'s super fun.\nI don\'t if you guys know this, but if you go, R1, R1, left, right,\nleft, right, circle, circle, you unlock smallpox. Now... as the colonies got better at cricket, it became a way to beat the colonizers\nat their own game. Most of the countries,\nand the top countries that play the game, has that little element of wanting\nto get back at the English. At least\non the cricket field, with the bat against an Englishman holding a ball, he could smash him for six after six\nand prove that he was not his inferior. The question of self-esteem, the question that here is an Indian,\na brown face with brown hand who could measure up to a white man. I love that. India whooped Britain\'s ass\nat their own game. The only thing\nthat would piss off Britain more is if India also took Michael Caine. That\'s right.\nHe\'s ours, and he fucking loves it. But today, India runs shit. India commands 70% of the global revenue, and in 2017, generated\n$1 billion in sponsorships and it\'s mostly thanks to three letters. -The IPL, the Indian Premier League. You\'re a fan? There\'s just, like, one random\nIndian dude like, ""Fuck, yeah! This is my episode. Last week you did NRA,\nnow we\'re doing cricket."" Meanwhile, there\'s 200 other people like, ""What the fuck is going on? You know crazy shit is happening\nin Alabama."" Just wait. This is for you. The IPL... plays a type of cricket called T20, okay? It\'s a shorter, explosive type of cricket,\nwhich took a game that looks like it was invented\nby Mitt fucking Romney and turned it into a cultural phenomenon. Oh, yes! Oh, wow! Du Plessis! Oh, the ripper!\nWhat a take! The Mustard Man is back, baby! Look, I think-- I think he just lives at the stadium. IPL cricket has so many viewers in India,\nit can sell everything from soda, cars, even condoms, which is not\nsomething Indians are known for using. ...right bowler\nwith the hope of making inroads... If you\'re not watching the match,\ncan I watch something else? Love sex? Durex. What the fuck? Wait. Wait, wait, let\'s break this down. He handed her the remote with his erection through the fabric of his clothes. Like, how did the director direct this?\nHe\'s like, ""Listen to me, Vinay... I need you to get a boner.""\nAnd he\'s like, ""On it."" In the prompter, it just says ""tense up."" Now as cringey as that video is, sex and spectacle made cricket\nwhat it is today. In 2008, the IPL flew in NFL cheerleaders in\nfor a match, and it broke every Indian man\nin a 50-foot radius. Okay, wait, this dude is talking about\nbringing sexuality to cricket like it\'s the solution to global warming. Then there\'s some random army general showing off a picture of cheerleaders\non his BlackBerry. Meanwhile, the horniest man in South Asia\nis just recording them, while his best friend is just whispering, ""Please send bobs,\nI need bobs immediately."" Look... Turning cricket into a thirst trap,\nit wasn\'t an accident. It was something that came directly\nfrom the league\'s infamous founder, Lalit Kumar Modi,\naka, Indian Bobby Jindal. Did you not violate certain norms\nof Indian culture? The pom-pom girls,\nblonde pom-pom girls. If I were in India, I\'d see that as a slap\nto the Indian womanhood. Again, you know, we did things\nthat were out of the ordinary. Actually, they talk about the IPL as a family product,\nthey talk about IPL where the whole family from the grandmother,\nto the grandfather, to the grandchildren,\nto the hot wife, to the husband are all actually looking forward\nto watching a program together. I don\'t think he meant to say ""hot wife,""\nbut that Freudian slip is very telling. Lalit Modi started the IPL in 2008\nwith an initial investment of $25 million. Two years later,\nthe IPL was worth $4.1 billion. Modi made cricket exciting.\nShorter matches, shorter seasons, and he paid the best players in the world\nto come to India. Everyone was giving Lalit props. Most innovative business leader of India\nis Lalit Modi. You\'re such a celebrity now. Is it true you can sell oil to the Arabs? I wish I could do that. IPL without Lalit Modi is like... A sugar-free candy bar. Modi was celebrated\nthroughout the cricket world for years and by years, I mean two. Exactly two. Once the most sought after man\nin Indian cricket, now an outcast, Modi has been\nfound guilty of rigging IPL bets. He has also been found guilty\nof charging a facilitation fee to the tune of $80 million. The 49-year-old is also guilty\nof not disclosing that his relatives had stake in a company\nthat purchased rights for the IPL website. In 2013, the BCCI,\nwhich is India\'s Cricket Board, found Lalit Modi guilty of eight counts\nof misconduct and kicked him out of the IPL.\nNow that\'s ballsy. Can you imagine firing someone\nwho made your organization billions of dollars\njust because they\'re an egomaniac? No, I\'m asking you.\nFacebook, Tesla, Twitter. Imagine it. Please. Modi denies the charges,\nbut rather than facing them in court, he left India and started showing up\non cable news like 2018 Roger Stone. -I am sorry. I am really sorry.\n-There will be a time when you will tire -of doing this.\n-Who are you to call me a fugitive? Who the hell do you think you are? You are sounding bitter.\nI am not bitter at all. I am not going to argue with a person\nwho has a closed mind. He tells me the question. Before I can answer,\nhe goes to somebody else. My complaint is-- My complaint is--\nMy complaint is-- My complaint is-- I think he was just trying\nto pick one complaint, and his whole system just crashed. He\'s just  like, ""My complaint is--\nMy complaint-- My complaint-- Just recharge."" But then, while Lalit was in Thailand,\nhe hit peak uncle. There must be a charge sheet\nor there must be a complaint. Where is it? -Okay. That--\n-Where is it? Seven years have gone by.\nI want you to ask the ED, where is the charge sheet?\nOne second! One second! Oh, my God! Every brown person on the planet\nhas been that reporter, right? There\'s just some fob in cargo pants\nyelling at you, wagging his finger and then we all do the same\nfull-body nod. We\'re like, ""All right. I\'m using my entire body\nto agree with you. Please shut the fuck up and let me leave\nthe mosque parking lot."" Now, look. I gotta give props\nwhere props are due. What Lalit Modi did with the IPL\nwas revolutionary. Okay? Thanks to him,\ncricket revenue exploded, between TV, streaming, live matches, condoms and sponsorship deals. It was like India had an oil boom. This influx of cash and eyeballs redefined the way\nglobal cricket is governed, and that\'s the problem. Now, fair warning.\nI\'m about to start doing graphs. So, if you have friends,\nnow\'s the time to hang out with them. On paper, global cricket is governed\nby an organization called the International Cricket Council,\naka, the ICC. The ICC oversees all 105\ncricket playing nations. They\'re top of the food chain. Indian cricket is governed by\nthe Board of Control for Cricket in India, aka, the BCCI, okay? And they are, and I mean this nicely, gigantic assholes. In theory, the ICC oversees the BCCI\nat the international level, but thanks to Indian cricket,\nthe BCCI makes so much money and commands so much viewership, they\'ve made the ICC their bitch, and every other country is forced\nto revolve around the BCCI. They bully other countries\nto get what they want. They make it practically impossible\nfor Indian players to compete in any foreign T20 tournaments, and you just can\'t say no to them. Just look at the upcoming World Cup, okay? Sixteen teams played in 2007. Now it\'s down to ten, the fewest number of teams\nin more than two decades. Fewer teams increases the odds\nof India being in more World Cup matches. Now, India in more World Cup matches\nmeans more money for advertisers in Indian cricket. So the BCCI is constantly just throwing\ntheir weight around. The most striking example\nof this might be a 2008 scandal called Monkeygate. Now I know that sounds like Jane Goodall\ngot #MeToo-ed, but it had nothing to do with that. Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh faces a three-match suspension\nafter the referee ruled he called Andrew Symonds, Australia\'s only non-white member,\n""a monkey"" during the two teams recent match\nin Sydney. Wait, there was a racism scandal\nin Australia, and the bad guy wasn\'t Australian? Harbhajan Singh denied saying ""monkey,"" and India threatened\nto pull out of the tournament unless the ICC\nlet Harbhajan Singh off the hook. So Australia fell in line and was like,  ""Hey, don\'t do that.\nIt\'s our fault. We need the money and the viewers, we shouldn\'t have had a black player\non our team."" Think about how insane that is. It\'s like\nAustralia\'s asking for forgiveness, even though their team\nand their player was the victim. That\'s like forcing a black family\nto invite BBQ Becky over to their next cook out. They\'re like, ""This is good\nfor racial unity. We need to do this."" These behind-the-scenes power plays\nare just the start. In 2014, India launched a cricket coup to take over international cricket by combining forces with England\nand Australia. They\'re known as ""The Big Three,""\nand they run everything. The Big Three,\nled by India, seized control of the International Cricket Council\'s\nkey committees and the way its funds are distributed. In the next eight years, ICC events, including the World Cup,\nare expected to harvest record revenues of at least $2.5 billion. The Big Three will take the lion\'s share, with India alone netting upwards\nof $500 million. Now, you might be wondering, why would all the other countries agree\nto such a shitty deal? Well, they didn\'t really have a choice. I know of a lot of countries\nthat are against the takeover. They voted against it initially, and then\neveryone just went to them individually and said, ""Listen, if you come with us,\nthis is what you can get. This is what you will get."" And eventually, they all fell in line. Holy shit. These guys sound like the Mafia... or FIFA. Now before 2014, every member of the ICC\ngot an equal share of cricket revenue. But under India\'s proposed plan,\nmore money went to The Big Three than to all other nations combined. With India getting by far the most. Think of this\nentire corruption clusterfuck like an Indian nesting doll, okay? The outside is the BCCI. Inside that is the IPL,\nand inside the IPL is Lalit Modi. Now... Even though he\'s long gone,\nthe moves he made are at the core of how Indian cricket ended up here.\nNow, Modi can\'t go back to India because he would likely get arrested,\nand he believes he\'ll be killed. So these days he lives\nin self-exile in London, but... I had to meet the guy\nso I flew to London to ask Lalit Modi about\nIndia\'s stranglehold on cricket and his role in all of it. How would you describe yourself\nin three words? And you cannot use the words\n""big dick energy."" Controversial. Controversy was the central pillar\nof the IPL. To me, you\'re like P.T. Barnum\nmeets Vince McMahon with a dash of Billy McFarland\nfrom the Fyre Festival. Thank you very much,\nI really appreciate that. That\'s a real compliment. I like it. You like those three-- There\'s not many people who can play\nall these three roles together. -You mean just shady, shady...\n-And more shady. That\'s it. It\'s weird that he openly identifies\nas shady. It would be like if Imagine Dragons\nopenly identified as bad. Now this isn\'t new. Lalit Modi has been doing shady shit\nsince he was in college. It was as a student\nat Duke University that Lalit Modi got caught in the circle of drugs. In 1985, he was arrested on charges\nof trafficking cocaine and assault with a deadly weapon\nwith an intent to kill. Modi pleaded guilty to his crimes\nand entered a plea bargain. Hey, come on. It was the \'80s, baby! Everyone was pushing coke. Now, I  know we\'ve got to talk\nabout cricket, but just bear with me. I had to ask Lalit Modi\nwhat went down at Duke. To me, you\'re like Zion Williamson.\nBoth of you guys were one and done. -He was one and done to go to the league,\n-Yeah. and you left to avoid jail time\nand kidnapping charges. Oh, no. There was no jail time.\nIt was only-- I had to do 200 hours\nof community service. There were no drugs there.\nWe were going to buy. You were on the way\nto get some coke and guns. -And we got robbed on the way.\n-Right. But it doesn\'t matter.\nIt\'s part of my life, I don\'t deny it. You know, I have no shame about it. Yeah! I mean, look, Lalit.\nIt was a long time ago. -It\'s fine!\n-I don\'t care about it. I have no problem with it, others do. -The haters hate.\n-I completely agree. -I\'m saying--\n-You let them know you\'ll do a bump\nand stay strapped immediately. -Absolutely.\n-And if they want to pop off... They can pop off,\nand I have no problem with that. Law enforcement agencies are just gonna\npop off. It\'s what they do. During his time with the IPL, Lalit Modi built up a rap sheet\nlike he was trying to get Future to write a song about him. But I had to push him on it\nbecause whether he denies it or not, Lalit Modi is complicit. His alleged corruption is indicative\nof how cricket is rotten to its core. You\'ve repeatedly said,\n""What have I been accused of?"" -Yes.\n-I\'ll just read it right to your face. ""The BCCI found you guilty\nof eight counts of misconduct, including rigging bids\nfor franchise owners you preferred and accepting kickbacks\nfrom broadcast deals."" -One minute.\n-I\'m not finished. ""The Indian government has opened\nmore than a dozen investigations into your financial dealings with the IPL,\nincluding money laundering."" The haven\'t found zilch, and as far as I\'m concerned,\nthey can keep digging, digging, digging \'til the cows come home. And they ain\'t going to find zilch\nbecause there isn\'t zilch. The majority of the people\nwho run away from the country... Are kind of guilty. And then have given interviews. I\'m on every network all the time\nand every time. -And I\'m there because I have no guilt.\n-Look, you\'re either-- I can look myself\nin the mirror every morning and be very happy and look at it,\nand I say, ""You look great."" Okay? ""Carry on."" That\'s a joke. I wish I was that confident,\njust bombing and being like, ""It\'s cool."" Because he created the IPL, Lalit Modi knows the power dynamics\nbetween the BCCI and the ICC, and he has strong feelings\nabout what\'s going on now. Does the BCCI have too much power\nover the ICC? What do you mean?\nThey control the bloody ICC. There is no ICC without the BCCI. Do you think even a single match\ncan take place without India? No. You think any broadcaster will buy\nany rights of the ICC without India? No. Is the BCCI preventing cricket\nfrom spreading to smaller countries? -Yes.\n-Is that bad for the sport? Very bad for the sport. Lalit Modi got banned for life in 2013, but the problems continued\nlong after he was kicked out. One of the best-known scandals involved\nthe BCCI\'s former president N. Srinivasan. During his tenure, players\nand officials were arrested for rigging games\nand illegal betting. One of the teams involved\nwas owned by N. Srinivasan, and one of the arrested officials\nwas his own son-in-law. Even though Srinivasan was not charged, it was so messy,\nthe Indian Supreme Court had to step in, forced him to step down, and called\nhis conflict of interest ""nauseating."" The even got\na former Supreme Court Justice, RM Lodha, to set up a commission\ncalled ""The Lodha Committee"" to clean up Indian cricket. Do you understand what I just said?\nThe Supreme Court got involved. Can you imagine if RBG was in charge\nof investigating Deflategate? Look, you know Roberts would side\nwith the Patriots. The Lodha Committee was set up\nover three years ago and to this day, many of those court-ordered changes\nstill haven\'t been made. Indian cricket has gotten to a point\nwhere it\'s too big to fail. Don\'t you think you created this problem\nby creating the IPL? I did, and I didn\'t foresee this. That\'s right. I am to blame for it. This is the only thing\nyou\'ve taken blame for. I am. I take blame for creating\nthe war chest for the BCCI, completely. Out of all the things I\'ve said\nto you today... Yes. Those I don\'t care about.\nThis I do take the blame for. You created the behemoth\nthat is now bullying... the rest of the world and preventing\nthe spread of cricket around the world? That\'s right.\nAnd I feel very bad about that. Modi helped create the cash cow\nthat gives the BCCI power. They always seem\nto put Indian cricket first at the expense of the global game. Now, Ayaz Memon is one of the most prominent\ncricket journalists in the world, and he echoes the same concern. Indian cricket establishment\nis phenomenally rich now, and I think that it\'s a bit of a shame\nthat India\'s not been able to take that agenda forward. They should be in the vanguard\nof spreading the gospel of cricket. Why don\'t they want to spread the game? They\'re caught in a bit of a dilemma. We are the most powerful cricket body\nin the world, and if we take it further\nthan what exists today, will it dilute our power? Indian Colonel Sanders is right. Look, one of the most significant ways India is holding back cricket\nmight be this. Possible Olympic gold medalist? Well, not if the BCCI have a say\nin the matter. The ICC for a while now have been trying\nto get cricket included as an Olympic sport, because they believe\nit will help the game grow. The BCCI, on the other hand,\ndon\'t want an Olympic Committee interfering with their business. Come on! India should love the Olympics.\nYou know this. We love recognition, and we love gold, but we have neither,\nbecause let\'s be real, India sucks at the Olympics. India is a country of 1.3 billion people\ndating back to roughly 2,000 BC. In that time,\nwe have won 28 Olympic medals. -Whoo-hoo!\n-Okay. Michael Phelps is a stoner dating back\nto the year 1985. In that time, he\'s won 28 Olympic medals. Our whole country is equal\nto one Subway spokesman. But cricket could actually change that. I think cricket can become\nan Olympic sport where you have at least 16,\nif not 20 or 24, nations playing it at a certain level\nwhich demands the attention -of the Olympic Committee.\n-So, who\'s the bad guy here? The stumbling block would be the BCCI.\nIn the past, they\'ve been, you know, ""Why get into the Olympics?\nThis is a sport we control, we run. It\'s very lucrative. It\'s very popular."" -Ayaz, we need cricket in the Olympics.\n-Absolutely. I think a lot of players are saying\nthey need cricket in the Olympics. Do you know how many medals\nIndia has won in the past century? -28, yes.\n-Do you know what the majority come in? Badminton. No, don\'t undermine badminton.\nIndia is doing very well in badminton. -I\'m not-- I\'m just saying--\n-It\'s breaking the hegemony of China. That sounds great, Ayaz,\nbut I don\'t want to win gold medals in sports that electrical engineers\nat Google play. My research team told me that\ntechnically, India has won more medals in field hockey than badminton,\nwhich is actually worse. Now if you don\'t think the Olympics\nare important, how the hell do we know what this is? Do you guys know what this is? Curling, yes! We have a better understanding\nof competitive ice cleaning than one of the biggest sports\nin the world. That is pathetic! The saddest part about all of this is that cricket can be\nsuch a force for good. We\'ve already seen\nso many inspiring examples. Afghanistan went from playing cricket\nin refugee camps to playing cricket at the highest level. Now, here\'s the crazy part. India was one of the first countries\nto invest in Afghanistan\'s cricket team, and on June 1,\nAfghanistan will play Australia in the opening round\nof this year\'s World Cup. Their rise shows what the spread\nof cricket can mean to a country. Now as an Indian, I\'m proud\nthat we\'re so dominant at cricket and that the game is finally exciting\nto watch. Look, we took something our colonizers\nforced on us, and we made it our own. But my complaint is... My complaint is... My complaint is... My complaint is... My complaint is we\'re so concerned\nwith owning the sport that it isn\'t about\nplaying cricket anymore. It\'s about colonizing it for ourselves.']"

I\'m actually gonna do an episode\xa0\nabout the Indian election. -What?\n-Are you out of your mind? You\'re being stupid now. Indian elections are a definite no-no. There is a lot of garbage outside, and that garbage\xa0\nis going to come on your face if you open your mouth on Indian politics. You cannot talk about\xa0Narendra Modi.\nYou cannot talk about\xa0Priyanka Gandhi. You cannot talk out in the open. -What about on the Internet?\n-Never on Internet! You are an NRI. You are an ABCD. \nYou are an American-born desi. You don\'t know the Indian politics. It is the world\'s largest democracy,\nand I\'m gonna talk about it. Politics is like a jalebi,\xa0\nround, round, round, you don\'t know where it ends,\nwhere it starts. Democracy is for people with power,\npeople with muscle power and money power. -It is not for you and me.\n-It\'s for gangs. You\'re going to make millions\nof people angry. With the Hindus, with the Muslims,\nwith the Sikhs. They are going to kill you. You will be no more. There will be an accident.\nYou will be burnt to death. You\'re gone. [speaking Hindi]\nDo you want a problem? -No, I don\'t want a problem.\n-Then why do you want to do it? You can talk about anything else. -Talk about cricket.\n-Talk about sneakers. -That\'s more comical.\n-That\'s more comical. -Do you know, your name--\n-Hasan means ""nice"" in Arabic. India is not Arabia. Your name rings a bell\xa0\nthat you are a terrorist. Period. -You\'re maybe... a Pakistani agent.\n-A Pakistani agent. -I\'m a Pakistani agent?\n-[woman] Yeah. Could be. -[theme music playing]\n-[crowd shouting] [siren wailing] [audience cheering] Hello! Thank you. Thank you so much. I\'m Hasan Minhaj. Welcome to Patriot Act.\nThank you guys so much. Thank you. All right, tonight... I want to talk about politics in India. I know, I\'m sorry. I know, I know.\xa0\nLook, talking about politics in India can get you in a lot of trouble,\xa0\nespecially... because I\'m Indian and Muslim. It\'s very weird to be something\xa0\nthat people love and then also be something\nthat people do not like. Right, it\'s like if one half of you\xa0\nwas Oreo cookie and then the other half with Muslim. There\'s no winning. It makes everything so much more\ncomplicated and confusing. And just a few weeks ago,\nthings got even worse after a terrorist attack in Kashmir. There has been a major escalation\nin tension between Pakistan and India. More than 40 people are dead\xa0\nafter a suicide bombing rammed into a bus filled with troops. A Pakistani-based terror group\xa0\nhas claimed responsibility for the attack. This is the most serious escalation\xa0\nin years\xa0 between the two nuclear-armed adversaries. Kashmir has been disputed territory\nbetween India and Pakistan since 1947. And here\'s how controversial Kashmir is. Look, no. Your eyes aren\'t messed up.  You don\'t need to get them checked.\nThat map is blurred because we were told that we could not show a map of Kashmir\xa0 without Indian-approved borders\xa0\nbecause if we did,\xa0 the Indian government would likely sue us. So, joke\'s on you, India, because Americans couldn\'t even find\xa0\nKashmir even if it were on a map. Clearly, the stakes are incredibly high. The bombing last month\nwas the deadliest terrorist attack\xa0 on Indian forces in Kashmir\xa0\nin almost 30 years. India responded by sending bombers\xa0\ninto Pakistan, which they say hit terrorist strongholds,\nbut Pakistan reported that India missed their targets\nand just hit a bunch of trees. And now,\xa0Pakistan plans\nto file a complaint with the UN, saying that the attack\xa0\non trees is eco-terrorism. And India was like, ""We would have\xa0hit\xa0\nsomething if our maps weren\'t so blurry. And just so you know,\xa0\nthose trees are terrorists."" Now India is adamant\xa0\nthat they hit their targets, but people started asking\xa0\nthe Indian government for proof\xa0 and then Indian cable news was like, ""Release the pundits."" He had nothing in mind, not his family,\nonly the country. -That, I salute--\n-[woman] No, but they want proof. -I\'m coming to that.\n-But they want proof what they destroyed. This is a moment of celebration for India. Not at all. You are liars! -You are hysterical people!\n-Oh? Yes, people like you are a curse\non this nation. Do you know that?\xa0\nYou are a curse on this nation. You are a shameless person,\xa0\nwhoever you are. This right here is every desi living\xa0room talking\xa0\nabout politics. Okay? Right now,\nyou have Indian Andy Garcia beefing with Indian Santa Claus.\n""You\'re a shameful man!"" While Indian Nancy Grace\xa0\nmoderates the debate. And while they\'re all shouting\xa0\nat each other, there\'s just some random uncle\nreading his Kindle. He\'s just like, ""Kashmir. This argument is never gonna end.\nI might as well get some reading done."" Now, you have to understand for India\xa0\nand Pakistan, Kashmir is a loyalty test. ""Hey, how Pakistani are you? How Indian are you?""\xa0 Right, and this test is coming\xa0\nat an incredibly critical moment in Indian politics. Good evening.\xa0\nOur top story on the 23rd of May, we will know who will form\nthe next government of India. More than 900 million people\xa0\nwill cast their votes. [man]\nIt\'s the biggest electoral show on Earth. And this time, it\'s all about this man, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In less than a month, India will be holding\xa0\ntheir general election, and everyone is talking about whether\xa0\nthe current Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be able to stay in power. But this election is about more than that. Since Modi came to power,\xa0\nIndia has grown more hostile\xa0 to minority groups.\nAmong a vocal minority, there\'s been a resurgence\nin religious nationalism, specifically Hindu nationalism,\nthe idea that India is a Hindu nation. Which completely goes against secularism, which is enshrined\nin the Indian constitution. And I know what you\'re thinking, ""Of course Hasan Minhaj\nwould say that about Mother India. After all, we all know he\'s a spy... -for Pakistan.""\n-[thunder crashes] In many ways, this election\xa0\nis about what it means to be Indian. And no, you can\'t just marry into it. India... is the largest\xa0democracy on Earth. It has around 900 million eligible voters, and you know if that many people\xa0\nvoted in America, it would still come down\nto 38 people in Florida. India has 29 states in seven territories, 22 official languages\xa0\nand every major religion. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains,\xa0\nJews, Buddhists and overly optimistic\xa0\nChristian missionaries. Who are like, ""Hey, you never know."" Even within Hinduism,\nthere are thousands of castes, which is the social class\nthat you\'re born into. All of this makes India\xa0one\nof the most diverse places on Earth. And yet, the only thing\xa0\nAmericans know about India is henna tattoos,\xa0\nGwen Stefani\'s bindi phase and goat yoga. [woman] So on your breath in,\njust open to the heart space. Lift the tailbone,\nshift your gaze forward... -Like this?\n-and maybe kiss your goat.\xa0[laughs] All of that diversity of India\ncan\'t be captured in a simple two party system. India has a parliamentary system,\xa0\nwhich is the nerdiest thing\xa0 that we took from the British. The last election\xa0\nhad over 8,000 candidates and roughly 464 political parties. Usually to take power,\xa0\nparties have to team up and form coalitions to get a majority. So coalitions can team up to win,\nlike LeBron with the Heat, or they can team up and lose,\nlike LeBron with the Lakers. For the last 30 years, it\'s been nearly impossible\xa0\nto govern without a coalition. But in 2014, the impossible happened. A historic win for\xa0Narendra Modi\nand the BJP party. The BJP has won enough seats\xa0\nfor a majority and many, many more. No single party has won a majority\xa0\nin India since 1984. Modi led the BJP, a right-wing\nnationalist party, to a\xa0landslide win. Modi\'s victory was built on\nhis rags-to-riches story, charisma and economic promises\nfor the poorest in India. [man] He promised to generate jobs\xa0\nfor the roughly 12 million young Indians who enter the workforce each year. We want small workplaces\nin factories to spread. In every village, street and neighborhood, we should see the impact of employment. But really, his campaign could be summed up\xa0\nin one phrase. India first. India first. India first. India first. [speaks foreign language] India first! It\'s like he was getting ready\nfor an audition. He\'s like, ""India first.\xa0\nGod damn it. Come on. Give me some more Pitino.\nIndia first! India first! Now, why does that sound so familiar? America first. America first. America first. Again, I\'m for America First. Trump even name-checked Modi in 2016. What I\'m about to show you guys\nis 100% real. This is a real campaign ad,\nand we did not edit this in any way. I look forward to working with\nPrime Minister Modi. [speaks foreign language] [sitar music playing] We love the Hindus. We love India. I\'m Donald Trump,\nand I approve this message. I love the way Trump says, ""The Hindus."" It\'s like he doesn\'t know what they are,\nbut definitely thinks they have powers. We love India. We love the Hindus! Come on, I can imagine an Indian uncle at home watching this\xa0\non Zee TV like, ""My man. That\'s what I\'m talking about. My man!""\xa0 Now throughout the upcoming election,\xa0 you\'re gonna hear a lot of people \ncomparing Modi to Trump, and I get why.\xa0 They both dislike the press, they both\xa0\nuse Twitter to attack their rivals. They\'re both strongmen with rabid fans, and they both greet people\nin very bizarre ways. Now, you guys all know\xa0\nTrump\'s handshake, right?  Trump yanks people like he\'s expecting\xa0\ncoins to come out of their mouth. And if Trump\'s a tugger, Modi\'s a\xa0hugger. [audience clamoring, applauding] Oh! I love how Modi just holds his hand. It\'s so gentle. He\'s just like...\xa0♪ Tum Paas Aaye\xa0♪ [hums] Look at Donald. No, no. You can tell that Donald\'s mad. He\'s pissed. Because that hug smooshed\xa0the McDouble\nin his pocket. Like, ""You got ketchup on my jacket."" -♪Yun Muskuraye\xa0♪\n-""Look, stop it. I already told you. I love the Hindus. But not touching,\nI don\'t even do that to Melania."" Now ultimately, comparing Modi to Trump\nis way too reductive. Modi is actually an incredibly charismatic\nand astute politician. He gives speeches all the time. But he is the only Indian prime minister\nto have never held a press conference\xa0 in his own country. That way, he can never be questioned\xa0\nabout his controversies. It\'s like posting on Instagram,\nbut disabling comments. And Modi has a history\xa0\nof saying a lot with silence. In 2002, when Modi was chief minister\xa0\nof the state of\xa0Gujarat,\xa0 he received international condemnation\xa0\nfor not speaking out\xa0 or stopping violent riots. Now, Modi said his response was adequate, and a court agreed. But almost 2,000 people\xa0\nwere still killed. Ultimately, Modi follows\xa0the Lil Wayne\xa0\nrule of diplomacy. ""Real G\'s move in silence like lasagna."" Now compare that to the man running against Modi,\xa0\nRahul Gandhi, aka, India\'s Michael Bublé. Now, he has no relation\xa0\nto Mahatma Gandhi, but Rahul Gandhi is the president\xa0\nof the Indian National Congress Party, the BJP\'s main opposition.\xa0\nHe\'s political royalty. His great-grandfather, grandmother\nand father were all prime ministers, but apparently,\ngreatness isn\'t hereditary. The BJP has called Rahul lazy, stupid,\nentitled, even pappu. In response to the insults, last summer\nin Parliament, Rahul was like, ""This ends right here, right now\xa0\nwith love from pappu."" -[speaking foreign language]\n-[shouting] Don\'t forget... Modi is a man who will hug anybody. Putin, Erdoğan, MBS, even Mark Zuckerberg, and here Modi was like,\xa0\n""Boundaries, Rahul, please. Please, just don\'t make me call HR."" No one has turned down a hug that hard\xa0\nsince Seinfeld turned down Kesha. I\'m Kesha, I love you so much. -Oh, thanks.\n-Can I give you a hug? -No, thanks. Yeah, no thanks.\n-Please, a little one. -Oh, ho-ho-ho.\n-[laughing] -[man] That was a nice woman.\n-I don\'t know who that was. Now, the truth is the downfall of Congress\nthat propelled the BJP to victory\xa0 started long before Rahul Gandhi, which is why I wanted to talk\xa0\nto both parties about what\xa0happened. But BJP officials did not respond\xa0\nto any of our interview requests. I don\'t know why. They left me on read, you guys. But Shashi Tharoor, a member of the Congress Party,\ndid agree to sit down with us. He\'s also a candidate\xa0\nin this year\'s elections. I\'m a member of parliament, second term at the lower house\xa0\nof the Indian Parliament. So, politically, who would you be\xa0\nif you we had to compare you to political figures in the United States?\nAre you like an Elizabeth Warren? [laughs] Do you mean in terms of ideology? Because honestly, there isn\'t quite\xa0\nan equivalent, our systems are different. -Are you more like a Chuck Schumer?\n-Slightly left of center,  somewhere between Schumer\nand Elizabeth Warren would about do it. Does Kamala Harris count? Okay, so you\'re more of a Kamala.\xa0\nOkay, all right. I think you\'re an Elizabeth. I just love the way he talks. He sounds like he\'s the voice\xa0\nof a wise moose in a Pixar movie. He\'s just like, ""Hasan, my boy. Avoid the cave during monsoon season. It\'s quite treacherous."" And I\'m like, I don\'t know,\xa0\nthe moose has spoken. Shashi has been very outspoken about the rightward shift\xa0\nof politics in India. In many ways, this coming election\xa0\nis about a battle for the soul of India. We\'ve had a party in power\nfor the last four and a half years, which in many ways, \nhas represented a radical departure from some aspects of what\xa0\nIndia has always been seen as being about. The India that you want\xa0\nto see your kids grow up in is India the people like me\xa0\nspeak for. An inclusive party that brings in people\xa0\nof all regions, all languages into a common platform,\xa0\nthat\'s the India of the Congress Party. I know you must be thinking,\n""Wow, that sounds like an incredible vision\xa0\nfor India.\xa0 The Congress Party sounds awesome."" But the Congress Party has been mired\xa0\nin numerous\xa0corruption scandals. There are honestly too many to go through\nright now, but the 2G Scandal is a hall of\xa0famer. How about this then? $40 billion. That\'s the ballpark figure\xa0being put\non the scale\xa0 of India\'s worst ever corruption scandal. A former telecoms minister\xa0is one\xa0\nof 14 individuals, along with three companies,\nfacing a variety of bribery allegations in the sale of mobile phone licenses. Just to put that number in perspective, for that amount of money,\xa0\nAunt Becky from Full House could have gotten 80,000 kids into USC. This was a major scandal. Time magazine ranked it the second worst \nabuse of power of all time, after Watergate. It\'s actually the second tattoo\xa0\non Roger Stone\'s back. Now, the people involved\nended up being acquitted, but the Indian courts\nare a whole other episode. The Congress Party has been a cesspool\nof corruption. So I had to ask Shashi Tharoor about it. No party has a monopoly on virtue, and no party\xa0\nhas a monopoly on corruption. Are you saying, like, in Indian politics,\ncorruption is just everywhere, both parties sort of have it? In India,\xa0increasingly,\xa0\nthere is that perception. To me, it feels like\xa0\ndescribing the way HPV is. You know how it\'s like,\xa0\n""Hey, come on. Everybody has it."" [laughs] I certainly hope that\'s not true. Okay. It\'s not just corruption charges that plague\nboth major political parties in India. As crazy as it sounds, people in both parties have faced murder\nand other serious charges, including the wise old moose. You called into question on Twitter\xa0\nthe motivation of the Delhi police in pursuing you, first on the question\xa0\nof whether you murdered your wife and now whether you were involved\xa0\nin pushing her towards suicide. There isn\'t a shred of truth in either\nthe charge that there was any foul play or any crime was involved\xa0in the tragic\xa0\nand premature death of my wife. God, it\'s so hard\xa0\nto keep the candidates straight in India. What\'s their economic policy?\nWhat about education? What degree of murder\xa0\nhave they been charged with? I\'ve got a charge that has been, you know, bandied about against me for some years,\nand I find this utterly preposterous that there is no sense\nof any proportion or reasonableness. It feels like every single politician has some sort of relation\xa0\nto either a murder charge or killing. Even Suge Knight would look\xa0\nat Indian politicians and be like, ""Yo, these people are fucking nuts."" In any democracy,\nvoters get the leaders they deserve, so you\'ve got to essentially leave it\nto the wisdom of the voters\xa0 to reject people who have credible charges\nand accusations against them. Great advice, Shashi. If the 2014 election was a referendum\xa0\non the Congress Party\'s massive failures, the 2019 election is a referendum\xa0\non Modi\'s economic promises. He promised to put Indians to work, but unemployment\xa0\nis the highest it\'s been in 45 years. We actually don\'t even know how bad it is because Modi\'s government\xa0\nhas been accused\xa0 of hiding unemployment data, which is like advertising a sublet\non Craigslist with no pictures. You know that shit is shady. You\'re like, ""Let me see some pics.""\nThey\'re like, ""Trust me. The place is great."" Then there\'s Modi\'s\xa0\nsignature economic policy,  demonetization, an attempt\xa0\nto get dark money out of circulation. It sounds like a good idea, but it ended up being a massive failure. Even the Reserve Bank of India\nwas against it, but Modi did it anyway. Now, I know a lot of you are thinking,\n""But, Hasan, at least he tried."" And let\'s be real, Indians... when have we ever given an A for effort? Really? You think I could go up to my dad,\n""Hey, Abbu,\xa0I got a participation trophy."" I\'m sleeping outside for an A minus.\nCome on, man. The worst part\xa0\nof the demonetization thing is that it hurt poor people the hardest,\nespecially farmers, who account for two-thirds\xa0\nof the population. Under Modi,\nmany farmers have financially suffered. [woman] Protesters say farm incomes\xa0\nhave plunged as produce prices have failed to keep pace\nwith the soaring costs of key supplies. Since this deceptive government has come, we farmers are worse off,\nwe\'re struggling for work and food. [man translating] I got very little money \nwhen I went to sell my rice crop. How will I earn? We\'re making a loss. Why is Larry the Cable Guy doing voice-over \nfor an Indian economic crisis? [imitating Larry the Cable Guy]\n""How will I grow my rice? In my Chevy Silverado."" [normal voice] But it goes beyond\nModi\'s failed economic policies. The BJP is currently trying to strip\xa0almost four million\nmostly Muslim immigrants of their right\xa0to vote\nin the state of Assam. If they get away with it,\xa0\nit will be the single largest voter disenfranchisement\nin recorded history. But of course,\nHasan Minhaj, the Pakistani agent... [shouts] would come to the defense\xa0\nof Muslim immigrants and to that, I say, ""How could I be a Pakistani agent\xa0\nwhen I\'m actually being paid by Qatar?"" [thunder crashes] Qatar is paying me oh-so well. All of these things have put Modi on very shaky ground going\xa0\ninto the 2019 elections. That was until\xa0the conflict\nin Kashmir reignited. The ruling party,\xa0Janata Party\nand other political parties are fine tuning election strategies. Sources suggest that it will be\nthe airstrike aftermath and the nationalist fervor around it. that will form the bulwark\nof election campaigning for the BJP. The nuclear showdown could not have come\nat a better time for Modi, who is doing everything he can\nto project strength in the most Indian way possible. This is a new India! This is an India\xa0\nthat will return the damage done by terrorists with interest! In classic Indian fashion, Modi had to mix revenge and finance. We will retaliate with 6% interest! And it will compound to 9%! Then we will refinance. And they\'re like...\xa0\n[speaks foreign language] Modi is appealing to his base\nwith his ""India First"" agenda. And at the same time, he\'s given new life\xa0\nto the Hindu nationalist movement\xa0 because of his deep ties to the RSS,\na right-wing organization that\'s the ideological backbone\xa0\nof the BJP. [man] They are\xa0disciplined and determined,\nand their numbers are growing fast. They are the RSS, a network of volunteers\nwho are playing a critical role in the election campaign of Narendra Modi. Some fear that the RSS\' ultimate goal is to force India to become less secular,\nmore religiously Hindu, spreading it\'s message through\xa0\nits daily meetings,  which critics called militaristic, accusations the RSS rejects. This is how Modi\'s gonna get elected? Donatello\'s just gonna hit a piñata? He\'s just like,\xa0\n""This broom is a lightsaber."" Look at him, he\'s just like,\xa0\n""I\'m done with cardio for the day."" [muttering] Oh, boy. Extremism, you burn so many calories. Modi isn\'t loosely affiliated\xa0\nwith the RSS. For decades,\xa0\nhe\'s been a card carrying member. He spent years working for the RSS,\nand he\'s pretty open about it. I stayed connected to RSS\xa0since childhood. The traditions and the discipline,\xa0\nthe hard-working nature I have, RSS had a huge role to play in that.\xa0 Modi being connected to the RSS\xa0\nshould be concerning. It\'s easy to laugh\xa0\nat the cosplay wing of the RSS, but they have some concerning beliefs. They have long relied on a book,\nand I swear this is the real title. It\'s called Bunch of Thoughts. Okay, that doesn\'t sound like\nthe manifesto of a radical movement. It sounds like the Medium post\xa0\nyou write after a divorce. Just like, ""I don\'t know man,\xa0\nCarol left me. Here are a bunch of thoughts.\nIt\'s a short 55-minute read. Just leave me a comment."" They\'ve recently disavowed parts of it,\nand I know why. It gets pretty Mein Kampfy in a few parts. Like when it says\xa0\nthere are three major internal threats, the Muslims, the Christians\xa0\nand the Communists. Once again, you guys, Muslims. We\'re number one, baby. Now, the RSS is extreme. They\'ve been banned in India\xa0several times\nfor stoking violence. The toll of religious extremism is something India has paid for\nin the past. A Hindu nationalist \nassassinated Mahatma Gandhi. Now I know people are like, ""Of course,\nHasan Minhaj, the spy from Qatar, is trying to divide India once again."" But how could that be possible\nwhen I\'m already being paid by Iran? [thunder crashes] Now, you know why\xa0\nthe Saudis don\'t like me. Hindu nationalists have been instigating\xa0\na culture of intimidation and violence towards a lot of religious minority groups\nthroughout India. [woman] Modi\'s most extreme\xa0nationalist\xa0\nsupporters have routinely taken to the streets using violence\xa0\nand intimidation to press their claim for a purely Hindu India. You see this trend throughout the country, but especially in the northern state\nof Uttar Pradesh which will be very important\nin the election.\xa0 UP is the most populous state in India\xa0\nwith a bigger population\xa0than Brazil. Yeah, and it has major electoral clout. Modi is heavily pushing\nhis nationalist agenda there, and he\'s doing it through one of India\'s\xa0\nmost hardcore\xa0political figures, a monk named Yogi Adityanath. Two years ago, Modi made him\xa0\nChief Minister of UP\xa0 and some believed he could succeed\xa0\nModi as prime minister,\xa0 which is very scary\xa0\nbecause he\'s a monk with a gun. If you don\'t have to commit crimes, why do you have a revolver\nworth 100,000 rupees? Why do you have rifles\xa0\nworth 80,000 rupees? Yes, I have these. As a monk, my training is in both discipline\xa0\nand in weapons. Discipline and weapons. He\'s like, ""I like to meditate,\nbut I also like to be strapped."" If you\'re a little confused,\xa0\nI understand why. This is an interview show\njust shot on Judge Judy\'s set, and then apparently over here,\xa0\nthey just shoot Dancing with the Stars. Now remember, this is the guy\xa0\nwho the BJP is counting on  to deliver votes, and he has\nsystematically used fear of minorities as a cultural wedge issue. Under Yogi Adityanath, \nthe state has changed the names\xa0 of places throughout the UP\nfrom Muslim names to Hindu names. And it isn\'t just Muslims, violence against all minorities\nhas gone up. Take for example\xa0the phenomenon known\xa0\nas cow lynchings. Thousands of people\xa0have taken\nto the streets across India to protest against rising attacks\xa0\non Muslims and Dalits by vigilante cow protection groups. Cows are a holy animal in Hinduism,\nand vigilantes want to protect cows, are targeting Muslims\nand a minority group called Dalits. [man] Religious minorities\xa0\nhave traditionally been free to farm and trade in cows, but there\'s been\xa0\na crackdown by right-wing politicians. The tough new stance\xa0\nhas not only fueled attacks on Muslims, but also on lower-caste Hindu Dalits. There were no reported lynchings in 2013, but since then, 46 people\xa0have been killed\nand 250 injured in cow-related violence. It\'s gotten so bad,\xa0Dalits are routinely\xa0\nvictimized by the lynchings. And The New Yorker reported that \ncommunal violence has jumped 28% during Modi\'s rule. This pattern\xa0\nof growing religious nationalism, violence, disregard for institutions,\nrampant misinformation, weak and corrupt opposition, we\'re seeing all of this around the globe. Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Spain, Brazil,\xa0\nthe Philippines and now India. Democracies are backsliding,\nand it\'s not just me saying this. Indians feel that something is different. What is at stake is nothing short\nof the future of this country. It\'s not an ordinary election. If 1977 was about deciding whether\xa0\nIndia will remain democratic or not, this election is about deciding whether\nIndia will remain India or not. Something much deeper is at stake here. Something deeper is at stake. Will India remain India or not? Will India define itself through inclusion\nor exclusion? As the election heats up, it\'s much easier for candidates\xa0\nto exploit the conflict in Kashmir for political gain than to address the economy\xa0and deepening\xa0\ndivisions within the country. But that doesn\'t make sense. We don\'t need the threat\xa0\nof nuclear warfare to flex nationalism. That\'s why we have cricket. We know this. Come on. We already know this, you guys. That India-Pakistan match\xa0\nis nuclear warfare. And look, you gotta understand for me.\nI gotta be honest with you. I\'ve always felt uncomfortable \'cause I have Indian\xa0\nand Pakistani friends,\xa0 and I\'ll be on both sides,\nand I\'ll just feel like I\'m in the middle. I\'ll be at one friend\'s house,\xa0\n""India, India!"" I\'ll be at the Pakistani-- ""Pakistan\'s\xa0\nin the-- [speaks\xa0foreign language] [hums] ♪ Pakistan! ♪\xa0""India won!"" ""Pakistan won."" ""No, India won."" ""No, Pakistan won.""\xa0\nI\'m like, ""No, dude, the British won."" And when it comes to this election, India shouldn\'t allow itself\xa0\nto be divided again. But what do I know? These are just a bunch of thoughts.']"

Now look. When I first heard we were\ngoing into lockdown, I panicked. I ran to the store, I hoarded\ntoilet paper, Purell, and batteries. So many batteries. I really thought the apocalypse\nwould involve more flashlights. But some people had a different idea. It's not water, it's not canned goods, it's not toilet paper, it's marijuana. “Panic buying at cannabis\ndispensaries. Look at the long line.” “Some long lines last night.” “Lines out the door here as well.” I just decided to stock up\non the weed, just in case\nthe guys closed down. You gotta prepare for the worst. I smoke so much pot, the Zig Zag Man\nhas a tattoo of me on his arm. Wait... is that Joe Biden? Only he would say “Zig Zag man.” Now, as lockdowns spread in March,\npot use hit record highs. And a lot of people are using marijuana\nto get through this difficult time. Which is why tonight\nI'm talking about weed. And I know, this isn't\nthe most pressing issue, but I want to talk about it for the same\nreason a lot of people want to smoke it: we all need a break. And yes, I know, I have Big Narc Energy. I don't do drugs, so I'm going to try to\nnot embarrass myself talking about them. Luckily, the bar is pretty low. We call this magic bus the canna-bus. Get it? Woah! Hundreds of people smoking weed. Skunk! The devil's lettuce!\nRighteous bush! Everybody needs a beautiful hand-blown bong. Rolling up a doobie. Does anyone still call it a doobie? And the groups in our school was like\nthe “swelts” and the “creamies,” and the “dirties,” and the “jocks.” And the “dirties”\nwere the ones who did pot. Wait, the “creamies” and the “dirties?” Megyn's like, “You guys remember high school. Prom, chem, race wars.” And the black woman in the front row is just like, “Okay,\nthis took a left turn, Megyn.” Now weed is still federally illegal. But right now, there are 31 states allowing\ndispensaries to stay open even as the country shuts down, with many calling them\n“essential businesses.” So, according to the government, weed is illegal, but also necessary. It's the waterboarding of drugs. Most Americans actually already live in a state\nthat allows weed in some form, which means the legal weed industry\nis exploding. Before the coronavirus, estimates said it'd be worth\nup to $19 billion this year and $30 billion by 2023. With that much money,\nyou could buy the Mets 13 times or buy enough weed\nto make baseball entertaining. Now look, if you're a baseball fan,\nI truly don't give a fuck. The only exciting thing that's\never happened in baseball was when Randy Johnson pitched the ball\nand a bird exploded. That's it. If they don't kill a bird every game,\nI'm not interested. We're obviously way past the idea\nof if we should legalize weed. It is here. But we haven't talked enough\nabout how to legalize it. Because we are messing it up. Legal marijuana is rigged. And it's about to get worse. Now to be fair, our weed laws\nhave always been messed up. We don't have time for the full history,\nbut, TLDR, it's pretty racist. It started in the 1930s, when government officials said stuff like, “Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men.” Obviously, dude went to high school\nwith Megyn. They were both were voted “most likely to insist\nthe Civil War was about states' rights.” Then Nixon started the war on drugs,\nand shit got even more racist. Black communities were targeted,\nand today, black people make up just\n13% of America but 40% of people\nimprisoned for drug crimes. So you would think legalization should benefit\nminority communities the most. But it's actually benefiting\npeople like this. Guess what?\nWe're selling legal weed. Do I call it a pot store\nor a marijuana store? You can call it whatever you want.\nI call it the future. There's no\nbars on the windows. There's no\nguy with a gun at the front. I want to convert\nevery Chardonnay mom to replace Chardonnay with pot. Ugh. He says “Chardonnay moms” like he\njust cleared it from his browser history. This is Adam Bierman, co-founder of the weed company MedMen. Now you've probably heard of them. And this is Bierman's business philosophy. Your song is always\nLose Yourself. That is the\nsoundtrack to my life. There's another Eminem... I don't know, how personal\nare we going to get? The last scene in 8 Mile... He starts the battle, and he starts it\nwith, you know, something like, “I am white, I do live\nin a trailer park with my mom.” Right. And by the time\nhe was done. the guy had nothing to say. In more and more instances\nI want to say, “Yeah, I am\nall those things.” He's actually none of those things. This is true. He grew up in San Diego. He went to USC. And his favorite TV show is The West Wing. Bro, you know what I realized? You're not 8 Mile, you're fucking Lady Bird. And if I have to stand here and listen to you pretend to be from Detroit any longer, I'm going to go chug a gallon of their water. Bierman is still on the board at MedMen, but he recently stepped down as CEO,\nand you might be wondering why. It could be because he paid himself millions\nbefore the company was profitable? Or because their stock tanked, or because he allegedly called an L.A. City councilman a “midget Negro.” But that can't be it. I mean, who would call\na governing official that name? That's insane. Now I have to go home\nand explain to my Latina wife and my\nSpanish-speaking kids why I'm being\ncalled a racist at work, right? I'm surprised he didn't go with, “I can't be racist.\nMy wife and kids are midget negros.” Now, he denies he ever said that. But Bierman actually isn't the worst\nperson to profit off legal weed. With me now former Speaker of the House\nJohn Boehner. Now you're all in on cannabis. I'm all in. This is the time to go all in\non cannabis. Cannabis is here to stay. And this industry\nis only getting bigger. As I said, I'm all in on cannabis. The most shocking part of this\nisn't that John Boehner likes weed. It's that John Boehner\ntalks like a manga character. He's like, “I'm John Boehner,\nand I'm all in on cannabis. Now let's talk for the next ten episodes,\nthen we'll finally fight.” That clip was from an online seminar\nfor weed investors that Boehner hosted. He's on the board of a company\ncalled Acreage Holdings, which means he's in line to make millions\noff of legal marijuana. Even though for years Boehner fought\nto keep it illegal. Which may sound super hypocritical... But don't worry.\nBoehner's got an airtight defense. Just listen to what\nNPR Austin Powers asks him. When you were a politician, you said you were unalterably\nopposed to legalization. One of the things I wanted to ask you\nwas what harm has been done by the fact that\nwe didn't legalize it back then? Oh I don't know there's\nany harm that's been done. There was people getting arrested,\npeople getting thrown in jail. Like, I mean,\nthat counts, doesn't it? Well yeah, but that was under\na different set of rules, at a different time. “A different time?” Dude, you left office five years ago. You can't do the “different time” thing. That's for when you take Grandpa\nto P.F. Chang's. Like, “Hey, we're really sorry he called\nthe waitress a ‘dumpling geisha.’ He's from a different time.” Acreage is one of the biggest\nweed companies in America. And before the pandemic,\nit was in 19 states and expanding fast. Part of that is demand, but another part\nis that states are building systems that are good for giant weed companies\nand bad for almost everyone else. And one of the main ways they do that\nis through licenses. In the weed business,\nyou need a license to literally do anything. And a lot of states make it easier\nfor big business to get licensed. Take California, America's sideburn. After they legalized\nrecreational weed in 2016, policymakers wanted to put\na one-acre limit on licenses\nfor weed farmers until 2023, to help small farmers and the little guy\nrein in big companies. But then, Big Marijuana spent $1.6 million\nlobbying, and things changed. Small pot farmers\nin California say the state\nis not standing by its promise\nto protect them. There are people who are stacking tens to close to\n100 one-acre cultivation permits. “We found one company\ngot 200 permits, enough\nto grow on 46 acres.” Yeah, of course you found them.\nThey grew a drug forest. Big companies were supposed to be limited. But some have stacked\nhundreds of licenses, which has small farmers\nstruggling to keep up. “New industrial-scale rivals have\neconomies of scale that lower their costs. So how can a small legal grower like Swami\npossibly compete? Branding. Swami Chaitanya\nannounces his presence... to Ganesh, Hindu god of,\namong other things, good luck, who presides over the crop Swami grows\nto produce Swami Select, his patented marijuana brand.” Aw, come on.\nIndian culture isn't for selling weed. It's for selling Coldplay. But okay, I'll bite. Who is this Swami? “Swami, in prior life\nWilliam Winans, a '60s Wesleyan grad, filmmaker, San Francisco hippie,\nwho spent ten years in India--” Whoa, wait, white people are pretending\nto be Indian to sell drugs? Dude, honestly, I'm proud. We got our own Rachel Dolezal. Raj Dolezal. But as bad as California is\nfor small weed businesses, there's a state that's even worse. Florida, America's uvula. In Florida, this is how they describe\nthe legal weed industry. It's a cartel. It's a cartel of license holders. They created a cartel essentially. You have\nan industry allowing for businesses\nto operate like cartels. I feel like every business in Florida\nis a cartel. Pottery Barn? Cartel.\nBabyGap? Cartel. Curves Fitness? Cartel. Dude, admit it, Pablo had some thickums. That's the other thing\nthat he hid from the DEA, that booty. Florida legalized medical marijuana\nin 2016 under then-governor Rick Scott. But the state gives out very few\noperating licenses, which makes things\ncutthroat and expensive. One license in Florida sold for $55 million. And to even qualify for a license, businesses have to have\nvertical integration, which means you control\nthe entire process. That means if you're in Florida,\nyou're in charge of setting up a farm, growing and harvesting the weed,\nprocessing the weed, distributing the weed, and operating\nthe stores that sell the weed. And some of you are thinking,\n“Whatever, bro. That's just Capitalism 101. Just don't smoke my weed, play my Xbox,\nor eat my Funyun casserole.” But this isn't just capitalism\nand the invisible hand. This is a demented thumb saying, “If you\ncan't afford to do every single step, you can't even play the game.” You're either flush with cash,\nor you're out. So if you're thinking,\n“Hey, me and my bros from high school we're going to go Miami. We're gonna set up a dispensary\nand make money.” No, you're not. Five companies now own 65%\nof Florida's weed business. They're hogging all the weed.\nKind of like you, Caleb. Caleb, pass that shit. Who raised you? Ten other states also require vertical\nintegration for medical marijuana. Across the country, big companies\nwith major capital run the table, because they can vertically integrate\nand snag licenses in multiple states. Just look at\nBoehner's company, Acreage. Right? They're one of the largest vertically integrated companies in the U.S. And as of last year, they held licenses\nin more states than any other company. Which made them super valuable. Canopy Growth will acquire a marijuana growing operation called Acreage Holdings, and they will pay\nclose to $4 billion for it. Close to $4 billion. Yeah. Whoa. I mean, how much pot do they grow? Why does it\nfeel like every day Stu Varney is blown away\nby a different number. He's like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa,\n$4 billion? I'm still reeling\nfrom 37 yesterday.” Now the deal has already made\nAcreage shareholders like Boehner $300 million. And this is\nwhat the industry is now: a few multi-state operators,\nwith lots of licenses in lots of states, raking it in. And it's hard to not notice a pattern. When you look around\nthe cannabis industry as an African-American woman,\nwhat do you see? White men. White men, white men, white men. Hold on. That's not fair to John Boehner. He's more of a “burnt sienna.” I'm serious, we did this: We went on the Benjamin Moore\ncolor match app, and he is somewhere between\na “Cottage Red” and a “Rustic Brick.” But she's right. According to one survey,\nout of all legal marijuana businesses, 81% are white-owned. Sorry, Swami-owned. And 4% are black-owned. And there's a reason for that. The war on drugs never ended. Today, white and black people use weed\nat roughly the same rate, but black people are almost four times\nmore likely to get arrested for it. In Montana, they're almost ten times\nmore likely to get arrested. Which is really bad\nfor the one black dude in Montana. Clarence, if you're watching this,\nbe careful. Even after you've done your time,\nold drug charges can haunt you. “What's been the impact of getting caught up\nin a criminal justice system on those charges at that age?” Ah... You will never... get a job. You'll never be able to live the way\nyou want to live. Your background is always\ngoing to come back. If you have a drug record,\nit can be almost impossible to get a job even in the weed business. Do you understand?\nThat means employers are like, “Oh, you sold weed? Sorry, we're professionals here\nat DabKingz4Lyfe.com.” Some states are trying to fix that\nthrough social equity programs, which help people hurt by the war on drugs\nbreak into the industry. But they aren't always effective.\nMassachusetts started one three years ago. Now guess how many black-owned\nretail dispensaries they have right now? One. In the whole state! So I had to sit down with the owners, back when I was still\nallowed to sit down with people So, guys, tell me,\nwhere are we sitting right now? We are in Pure Oasis, soon to be Boston's first recreational dispensary. The first economic empowerment\nowned dispensary in Massachusetts and also the first minority-owned\ncannabis dispensary on the East Coast. So when this place opens, this will be\nthe very first time pot is sold in Boston. That's so amazing. Man, I can't wait\nfor all those Boston weed strains. “Purple Harvard.” “Jamaican Affleck.” “Strawberry Busing Riot.” These are the owners of Pure Oasis, Kobie and Kevin. And I wanted to ask them how they feel about equity programs. Would you say equity programs\nare effective? -Absolutely.\n-Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think the success of\nan equity program hinges upon other things, but I think by and large, if there was no equity program, Kobie and I may not\nbe sitting before you today. Has the execution of the equity programs\nmatched their intent? -No.\n-I would agree with “no.” What this needs in order for people\nto be successful are a list of wraparound services. -Access to capital, legal, tax help.\n-Taxes, technical assistance. So for this to be fair,\nit has to provide reach-around services. Wraparound services. It provides equity capital, you know\ntechnical services... -Yeah.\n-Exactly. ...you know, pleasure, joy,\na release that feels good. -No, no, no, wraparound.\n-Wraparound. Different. Wrap-around, reach-around... You say, “Tomato,”\nI say, “Pleasure that tomahto.” Good equity programs do all those things,\nplus they help people get licenses. The program in Massachusetts\nactually helped Kobie and Kevin move up the list and get their's faster. But since everyone wants a license, once you have one,\nyou can become a target for big investors. What did the out-of-state investors\nreally want from you? They wanted control of our company. But, really. What does that mean? They wanted to loan us money\nto really build the operation, and in a nutshell, the conversations\nfor us felt very predatory. Almost like loan shark-y. This is our company. When they walked into the room,\nthey acknowledged that it was our company. But as the night progressed,\nit became clear that they wanted to take our company\nand make us employees. That was insulting. I don't see what's so offensive here.\nCannabis is a crop, okay? These VCs have come in and asked you to share crop. White dudes are coming up to two\nblack men and saying, “Hey, share crop.” And then the VCs could help\nstructure the company in a new way. It'd be a kind of like\na Reconstruction era. I don't know. This just seems like a simple,\nblack and white issue to me. Big companies use equity programs\nto get control of more licenses. This is a huge loophole, and Big Marijuana\nis walking right through. Last year,\na company called Harvest of Ohio claimed a black woman\nwas their majority owner when their CEO was actually a white dude named Steve White. That name is whiter than a Nalgene\nclipped onto a carry-on with a carabiner. Have you ever seen\na black person own this? Now, Harvest says\nthey didn't do anything wrong. But this begs the question, “Is it worth it?” This is a racial and economic issue. If we're just gonna make the rich richer, freeze out small business\nand the little guy, and ignore victims of the war on drugs, should we legalize weed at all? This isn't a hypothetical question.\nLast year, New York delayed legalization in part because\nit didn't do enough for racial justice. And Ohio had a super-bizarre fight\nabout legalization. In 2015, a group called Responsible Ohio\nstarted a legalization campaign with one surprising spokesman. I'm Nick Lachey. Ohio is my home, and I care very deeply\nabout the people here. Wait. Nick Lachey? The co-host of Love Is Blind? The former lead singer of 98°? You guys remember 98°.\nThe clearance rack version of *NSYNC. If the weed business gets any whiter, every weed menu\nwill start including shakshuka. Now Nick Lachey wasn't just\npromoting legalization out of the goodness\nof his 98° heart. He had another motive. “Critics argue the ad fails to\nmention Lachey's stake as an investor.” “The constitutional amendment\nwould give exclusive rights to all of the marijuana\ngrown and sold at 1,100 stores\nin the Buckeye State at 1,100 stores\nin the Buckeye State\nto just ten groups. to just ten groups. One is Lachey's.” Lachey wanted a system rigged\nfor just ten growers, including himself. That is so messed up.\nThis is what this show has come to. When we first started, I was getting into beefs\nwith international dictators. Now I'm like, “We must stop\nthe lead singer of 98°.” Lachey actually wasn't\nthe only celeb involved. “TV and music star Nick Lachey,\nNFL player Frostee Rucker, fashion designer Nanette Lepore, and even President William Taft's\ngreat-great-grandnephews have financial stakes in the game.” This is President William Howard Taft's\ngreat-great-grandnephew Dudley Taft. This is a real person. He looks like a guy who plays guitar in a band named after himself. Because he fucking does. ♪ I'mma take my cellphone ♪ ♪ And throw it in a deep hole ♪ ♪ It's gonna pollute your soul ♪ ♪ Give me a simple life ♪ ♪ Yeah! ♪ This is what all rock 'n' roll\nsounds like to me. Just a bearded redneck\nshouting like a Michigan protestor. You hear Metallica,\nI hear, “Open the Foot Locker, man!” Now the people of Ohio\nrealized what was happening and voted down\nthe Lachey-Taft drug cartel. Let me make something clear.\nI'm not saying legalization is bad. Smoke weed. Hotbox your face mask. But support for legalization\nshouldn't be automatic. We need to look into how it works\nand who it works for. Even though sales are up in some places,\nCOVID is still hurting the industry, especially small businesses. I caught up with Kobie and Kevin to see\nhow they're doing right now with all this. They had to shut down,\nthey had to lay off their employees, and because weed is still federally\nillegal, they can't get any federal loans. Now luckily, they say\nthey have enough cash for now, but they said other small businesses\nlike theirs might not survive. This is what pisses me off the most. This is yet another industry where a small group of people at the top\nhoard all the profits and the little guy has no chance. Before COVID, twelve more states were planning to vote on some\nform of legalization this year. Now a lot of them have put those plans on\nhold, which I think could be a good thing. It gives us a chance to step back and look at what\nthese laws are really doing. Because as a Rustic Brick once said... This is the time\nto go all in on cannabis. But only if all of us get to.""]"

Except for Jeff Goldblum. He's still\nout here dressing like he's in BTS. But COVID-19 is also hitting young people\nin a major way. Across America,\nlife is changing rapidly. Hundreds of schools and colleges\nare closing nationwide. Stanford, Princeton, Harvard.\nA lot of schools. And it seems like,\nthe number is growing by the day. “At Kent State University, today\nmany students moved out unexpectedly.” -What are you taking with you?\n-Everything. Millions of students home early. I know. I've got one here\nwho's behind the camera this morning. A 19-year-old from BU. Why do I feel\nlike I should call the FBI? “I've got a 19-year-old\nstudent back here. Taut, supple, loves hockey.” Colleges were some of the first places\nto shut down because of corona. In an instant,\nchildhood bedrooms became dorms, moms became cafeteria workers, and Econ 101 looked like\nThe Brady Bunch fucked Don Lemon's show. By the way,\nI love how celebrities are also like, “Aww, you didn't get a graduation? Let me just FaceTime you\nfrom my bedroom.” So keep your eyes on the ball. There's always the haves and the\nhave nots in a capitalistic society. Trust me, as a dude\nwho only got a 1310 on the SAT and became a stand up comedian,\nthere's no shame in living at home. Okay, look. They didn't ask me to be\nin the “Imagine” video, so I had to take\nwhat I could get. It's no secret,\nstudents aren't loving classes online. And not just because one teacher\nforgot to close his porn tabs. It's a shame he had to resign. He loved his job so much,\nhe literally jerked off to it. Schools going online also meant that students weren't getting\nwhat they'd paid for. A lot of them were pissed. Students are suing two major\nuniversities in New England. “Demanding repayment\nfor their tuition, and their room and board.” It's just kind of wild to think\nthat we had to pay $55,000 for basically the same thing\nyou could find on Coursera or edX. Holy shit, $55,000\nfor a glorified MasterClass? That's enough to take Screenwriting with Aaron Sorkin and buy the mountain of cocaine\nhe used to write A Few Good Men. So far, students around the country have\nfiled at least 100 lawsuits for refunds. The dean at NYU Tisch sent an email\nsaying there'd be no refunds for tuition and then attached this very real video. ♪ That's me in the corner ♪ ♪ That's me in the spotlight\nLosing my religion ♪ Someone forcing you to listen to R.E.M. is\nalready one of the worst parts of college. You just don't expect it to be your dean. Also, it's $58,000 a year to go to Tisch. And she's like, “Sorry you can't get your\nmoney back, here's a free Zumba class.” There's actually one big reason why\nschools don't want to give out refunds. “The American Council on Education now projects nationwide enrollment in the fall will be down 15% for a revenue loss, conservatively, of $23 billion.” $23 billion. That is so much money\nthey could have used to not pay college athletes. The truth is, some schools\naren't going to make it through COVID. One estimate says 345\nuniversities across the country may have to close\nin the next six years. The University of Akron\nis closing six of its eleven colleges. And for the schools that are staying open,\nrules are all over the place. The Cal State system announced\nthat classes will only be online. And UNC\nand Notre Dame are going to open early, but then end the semester by Thanksgiving. Look... no one has a clue what college\nis going to look like next year. So if you're about to go to college,\nor you're in college, or if you're a parent, you're probably wondering... Is college still worth it? Because with student debt\ncrushing so many people, it's important to know: what are you\nreally getting for your money? This debate isn't new, by the way. Pre-COVID, lots of people were questioning\nthe value of college. Especially rich assholes. -There's no need even to have a\ncollege degree at all.\n- Oh, okay. Don't spend, you know, $200,000\non a college degree and waste\nfour years of your life. Colleges, they're like as corrupt\nas the Catholic Church was 500 years ago. He's right, everyone knows colleges\nforce professors to remain celibate and burn heretics alive. Look,\nI get that a lot of people feel that way. But growing up most of us were told, “Hey, if you get into the right college, it's\nyour golden ticket.” I believed that. It's why these videos are a thing. I just got into Harvard. Oh my god, I got in! -Yeah, baby!\n-Oh my god. To all my Asian parents watching at home: the thing those parents were doing\nis something called “being proud.” I know. It's stupid. So clearly a lot of people\nstill think college is worth it. You know the intangibles: social skills, critical thinking, and the chance to smoke weed out of\nyour roommate's sleep apnea machine. But there are real facts\nin favor of college: over their careers,\nwomen with a college degree earn about $450,000 more\nthan high school grads. For men, it's $660,000 more. For low-income students, a college degree may be the\nsingle best engine for social mobility. If you grow up poor\nand graduate from college, you have a 90% chance\nof getting out of poverty. So, getting a degree\nis kind of like being Tom Hanks' kid. Your chances of ending up okay\nare very high but it's not 100%. It's ya boy Chet and I\ncoming straight from the Golden Globes, y'know what I'm saying? My father Tom Hanks presenting\nan award soon forward come. Big up, tune in. By Golden Globes' standards, this actually counts as diversity. So, the benefits of a college degree\nare pretty obvious. But what you may not realize, is that the downside of not having\na degree is getting worse. In the '90s, jobs that paid at least $35,000 were held by college grads\n40% of the time. Today, it's 55%. But that's mainly because in the '90s most people had a job\nbeing in Guns N' Roses. But here is the most shocking fact. Americans are killing themselves\nby drinking, by accidentally overdosing,\nby overeating, or more quickly and more\nstraightforwardly, by committing suicide. Deaths of despair have risen in parallel\nfor men and women. The key distinction here\nis not between men and women, but rather between those\nwith and without a college degree. That is so depressing. Even when you hear it\nfrom a Hogwarts professor. Working-class life\nis more grueling than ever. Look at the number of white people\nwho died from deaths of despair. This is how many had a college degree. And this is how many who didn't. That should be on every brochure by the way. Just like, “Chico State,\ngo here, or die of unnatural causes.” Do you see what's happening here? College used to be aspirational,\nit was your shot at a better life. But these days, you're not really rewarded\nfor getting a degree. It's kind of expected. But you are definitely penalized\nfor not getting one. So when it comes to going to college,\nit's an unenthusiastic yes. Like voting for Joe Biden. It sucks, but you're probably gonna do it\nif you want a future. And whether or not colleges know this,\nthey have you by the balls. Which means they can twist and squeeze. Check this out: college tuition has more\nthan doubled over the past 30 years. And on top of that, tuition and fees\nmake up only 48% of total costs students actually\npay to attend those schools. Obviously, we all know\ncollege is expensive. But what you might not know\nis that the product is getting worse. Just look at what's happening\nto tenured professors. Tenure is when a university gives\na professor lifelong job security to do research and teach. They're well-paid, killer benefits. It's the Delta Gold Medallion status\nof academia. Good professors are necessary. Without them, college is just\nramen noodles and a few pregnancy scares. But tenured professors\nare being replaced with a cheaper option. Statistics over the last 10-20 years\npoint toward a growing trend in the employment\nof adjunct or part-time professors. It's the Uber economy\nwhere everything's freelance. What might be called\nthe “adjunctivitis epidemic.” Ugh. “Adjunctivitis?” Okay no, only one disease per episode. It's why we're talking about college\nand I haven't once mentioned chlamydia. Adjuncts are the gig workers\nof higher education. And they are now\nteaching a lot of classes. Since 1975, the percentage of tenured or tenure-track professors has dropped. But non-tenured teachers has shot up. I'm not saying that adjuncts are bad. It's just that they're expected to do\nthe same work as tenured professors, while getting treated like shit. We are not\ngiven any kind of benefits. No medical, no dental, no vision, no retirement, no family leave,\nno sick leave, nothing. “To support his family, Rob Balla drives to three different\nOhio universities, to teach six English classes, and tutors on the side. He had pneumonia last fall,\nworked anyway.” “Ellen Tara James-Penney\nis an adjunct professor at San Jose State. On most nights, she sleeps in her car.” Can you imagine finding out\nyour college teacher lives in their car? That's almost as bad as finding out your\n2nd grade teacher doesn't live at school. “Mrs. Caldwell? Why are you at the movies? And who gave you jeans?” If your professor is running\nfrom college to college, working through pneumonia,\nand living in their car, it'll probably impact\nthe quality of your education. Look, no one wants to go to office hours\nin a '07 Honda Civic. He's like, “Hey, don't worry,\nit's leather seats.” Adjuncts have it pretty bad, but\nthere's one group that has it even worse: teaching assistants- grad students\nwho are also paid to teach undergrads. Now we usually think of TAs\nas slightly hornier professors. But they do a lot. At Purdue, 26% of grad students are the primary teacher\nfor at least one course. And if you want a 25-year-old to explain\nDavid Foster Wallace to you, don't go to college,\njust go on Hinge. TAs average\nless than $14,000 a year. $14,000! The only way it could've been worse is if they got paid\nin “Losing My Religion” dances. So it's no surprise\nthat tons of grad students are doing this: “Hundreds of grad student workers\nat UC Santa Cruz are putting their jobs on the line. They've been on strike now for nearly\ntwo weeks demanding higher pay.” “And they're joined\nby other schools north and south. Strikes are underway at\nUC Santa Barbara and UC Davis.” “Ben Scheer, who has\nscratches on his head and arm, says cops arrested him\nfor not moving when police approached\nthe demonstrators in riot gear.” Why are the police wearing riot gear? What is Ben going to do? Attack you\nwith specific examples from the text? As many of you know, UC Santa Cruz\nis an old friend of the show. And it's a pretty progressive place. So of course the school listened to\nthe students, considered their concerns, and decided they could go fuck themselves. We've learned the UC Santa Cruz\ngrading strike continues with a new round of\ngraduate teaching assistants being fired. The striking group says\nthis leaves the grad students ineligible for unemployment benefits\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Ah, now I know why your school's mascot\nis a banana slug. 'Cause your administration is gross, slimy,\nand reminds everyone of flaccid dicks. Look, I know I used to say this as a joke,\nbut now I mean it sincerely. Transfer to Berkeley.\nYour parents will be prouder. By the way, grad students\nhave been protesting at Harvard, Yale,\nand the University of Chicago. So, if you're an incoming freshman,\nthink about what this means. You're paying a lot of money for school, but only a fraction of it\nis going to your education. So you're probably wondering... where is my money going? There are people who make\nhundreds of thousands of dollars as provosts, as presidents,\nas chancellors, and between 1970 and 2008, the adjunct pay\nhas gone down 49%. The college president's salary\nhas gone up 35%. Let's break this down. While colleges were losing\ntenured professors, they were beefing up administrators\nat an insane rate. In over 30 years, the number of\nadministrators at private schools shot up 135%. I'm talking deans, coordinators,\nvice presidents, provosts. By the way... what the fuck is a provost? Does anybody actually know? 'Cause I googled it, and all it said was, “A person who does a thing\nat a university.” So I clicked on Wikipedia, and a pop-up said, “There are some things you aren't\nmeant to know, Hasan.” But I clicked it anyway,\nand this happened. I didn't realize EDM could sound so... threatening. What I'm saying is, if I mysteriously\nvanish, you know what happened. Find the pallbearers. High level administrators\nare raking it in. In less than ten years, the number of presidents and chancellors\nmaking over a mil went from 28 to 76. That is an exponential spike. But presidents aren't even\nthe highest-paid administrators. If you want to see who's really making bank,\ndon't look at who runs the school. Look at who runs the endowment.\nSo if any of you guys have graduated, you know that blocked number that\nrandomly calls you, asking for money? They're like, “Hey, we're your college.\nRemember us?” And you're like, “Nope! I've given you\nassholes enough. Never call me again.” The money they collect from that call\ngoes into an endowment. And the people who manage that endowment often get paid more than anyone on campus. In 2014, Yale spent $400 million\non investment managers. Nearly three times what they spent\non tuition assistance. Which is odd,\nbecause these funds are massive. “Princeton reported an endowment\nof $26.1 billion last year.” Stanford has a $27 billion endowment. “The University of Texas, which\nhas a $31 billion endowment.” Harvard does happen to be\nthe richest college in the world. It has a $40 billion endowment. $40 billion! That is bigger than the economies\nof half the countries in the world, including Afghanistan,\nHonduras, and Cambodia. Basically, Harvard's endowment\nis bigger than the countries destroyed by its alumni. You got to give him props. Do you know hard it is to be\nthe biggest murderer from your school when you went to the same school as the fucking Unabomber? Bottom line: when you donate to a university, you're basically donating to a hedge fund\nwith the same name as a university. And clearly endowment managers\nhave a lot of responsibility. But the question is,\ndoes it benefit your education? “Harvard's website does say that it doesn't\nuse endowments to reduce tuition, because, one, they have\nto maintain the endowment, and much of it is restricted or set away\nfor specific projects. In 2018, most of the money\nwas put into things like hedge funds, real estate,\nstocks and bonds.” To be fair, an endowment isn't like\na bank account. There are restrictions. But criticizing them\nhas become a bipartisan issue. These universities use the money\nto pay their administrators or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money,\nkeep it, and invest it. Wait... it's like Trump and Bernie\nswapped just one opinion. Somewhere, Bernie Sanders is giving a speech\nabout how ugly Ted Cruz's wife is. “She's a 4 at best! Swipe left.” Look, if anyone knows\nabout scamming college kids, it's Trump. But he is right. Most schools only spend about 5%\nof their endowments every year. And Harvard admits that 30%\nof what they do spend is flexible. That's $600 million\nflexible dollars a year! So maybe the next time\nthere's a global pandemic, you could do more to help these low-income\nstudents who had to start a GoFundMe. But no, it's cool. Blow another hundred mil\non vineyards instead. So, when you see schools\nrelying on gig workers, firing employees who strike,\nboosting president pay, and dumping money into hedge funds, this isn't the playbook\nof an academic institution. This is the playbook\nof a corporate institution. And that's a shift\nthat's been going on for a long time. Since the recession in 2008, universities have seen\ntheir revenues decline, and overall state funding for\npublic colleges and universities remains $9 billion\nbelow its pre-recession levels. If you go to an Ivy League school,\nyou're fine. But state funding for public colleges\nnever recovered from the '08 financial crisis. Tuition used to make up a third\nof their funding. Today, it's almost half. Which might not seem like a big deal, but it comes with a huge shift\nin priorities. If schools live or die by tuition, what do you think priority number one\nis going to be? Chasing down kids who come from money. “It's housing fit for royalty.” The best of the best amenities. “And it's offered\nonly to college students.” This is a three-bedroom,\ntwo-bath. “With state-of-the-art appliances,\nchandeliers, and a wine fridge. Outside, there's a private Jacuzzi. Inside, a shower head\nwith Bluetooth capability.” And music comes out the middle. I get trying to appeal to rich kids, but have they ever met one? No one's ever been like,\n“That guy is so rich, I bet he listens to music\nout of his shower head.” Before COVID, colleges were transforming\ninto playgrounds for rich kids. I'm talking about\na ball pit at MIT, a five-story rock climbing\nwall at Auburn, even a private steak house\nat High Point University. But for some reason, colleges have been obsessed\nwith one specific amenity. “Students at Louisiana State University\ncan now enjoy a 500-foot lazy river\nthat spells out ‘LSU.’” “They're getting a lazy river\nat college. This is all part of a new sports facility\nat the University of Central Florida.” When I saw that they\nhad a lazy river, that definitely moved it up\non my top priority list. What's with this theme park bullshit? Colleges shouldn't be fun\nlike Disney World. They should be soul-crushing\nlike Epcot Center. Fuck that golf ball of sadness.\nSeriously. Remember being a kid? Your parents would be like,\n“Let's go to Epcot.” You're like, “Yeah!” Then you get there and they're like,\n“Hey kids, want to learn about physics?” You're like, “Fuck this place.” By the way, that lazy river at LSU\nwas part of a renovated facility worth almost $85 million. Which is crazy when you find out\nwhere that money could've gone. “LSU senior Catherine McKinney\ntook us on a tour of what she says are her school's\nquestionable priorities. At the library, we saw some\nof the building literally falling apart.” The library has water in the basement\nand rugs from another generation. Right. But you have a lazy river. But we have a lazy river, so maybe\nI should just go relax, you know? Do they have... chemistry? The school is falling apart,\nbut I feel like they're vibing. At the very least, they're definitely\ngoing to turn this into a romcom called The Lazy River. What is going on? We are turning universities,\none of our best tools for social mobility, into a Carnival Cruise\nthat caters to the rich. And that inequity\nis only going to get worse. “Before the pandemic,\nthe gap was closing. More low-income\nfirst-generation students were enrolling\nin colleges nationwide. Now advocates worry\nthat progress could be lost. High school senior\nOmar Quevedo-Catana had to start\nworking full-time at Walmart after his mother\nlost her house cleaning job.” It's really just me trying\nto keep everyone afloat. And... yeah, it's been tough. Omar's situation is exactly what\na lot of students are going through. You feel like you're in a catch-22: you can't afford college, but the rules of modern society\nare forcing you to go. So while we're figuring out what\ncollege will even look like in the future, now would be a good time to ask: what value are you even getting\nout of these schools? We've clearly shown,\ncollege is a business, which means you're the customer. And I don't want to be an Indian dad\nabout this, but you got to make sure\nyou are getting what you pay for. Because in ten years, a “lazy river” ain't going to mean\nshit on your LinkedIn.""]"

[laughs] In case you don\'t know the full story, back in October, we did an episode\xa0about\xa0\nthe Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman\nand his involvement in the killing of Washington Post journalist\xa0\nJamal Khashoggi, and the Kingdom wasn\'t thrilled. Well, Netflix under fire today\nafter its decision to pull an episode of a comedy show that was critical of\xa0\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin\xa0Salman. [man] Patriot Act, with ""Hasan Majan""-- -""Minhan""--\n-[woman] Minhaj, yeah. Netflix confirmed it removed the episode\nfrom streaming in Saudi Arabia\xa0 after the country\'s Communications \nand Information Technology Commission  made a request that it take it down. A request? Does MBS think Netflix is a wedding DJ? I have a quick request. Just take down that one episode\xa0\nthat\'s criticizing me and then just play Usher\'s Yeah. A request is when a neighbor tells you\nto turn the music down. A demand is when\xa0\nthat neighbor is Conor McGregor and you\'re in his parking spot. I still can\'t believe it. We got Saudi Arabia\xa0\nto issue its very own Muslim ban. Netflix has received a request,\xa0\na legal request actually from Saudi Arabia to remove this episode. Saudi Arabian officials cited article six \nof their anti-cybercrime law. Cybercrime. You\'re telling me, even in Saudi prison,\nI\'ll be associated with the IT department. Okay, let\'s break down\xa0\nhow I became an Internet bad boy.\xa0 According to article six\nof the Saudi Arabian anti-cybercrime law, any content that impinges on public order, religious values\xa0\nor public morals is prohibited. Of all the Netflix Originals,\nthe only show that Saudi Arabia thinks\xa0\nviolates ""Muslim values"" is the one hosted by a Muslim. Do you know what\'s still streaming\xa0\nin Saudi Arabia? We got access to Netflix in Saudi Arabia\xa0\nthrough an online proxy, which allows you to make it look like\xa0\nyour IP address is from another country. So, this is Netflix in Saudi Arabia. These shows are still streaming.\nSabrina, still up. It has literal devil worship\xa0\nand a lot of premarital witch sex. BoJack Horseman. There\'s  an alcoholic horse-man\nwho snorts cocaine. And let\'s not forget those evil cooking shows. Porky goodness! Vitamin P!\xa0 Fat from the hog, a la natural. [woman] It must be like Christmas\xa0\nevery time you break open a new pig. This is Haram City. Not eating pork is the one rule\nevery Muslim agrees on. I have a cousin who\'s atheist,\nand he\'ll be rolling a blunt, drinking, and he\'ll still be like, ""Hey, man, \nis there pepperoni on that pizza?"" Look, I don\'t know if there\'s a God\nbut if there is one, he hates pepperoni. You know the most bizarre thing\nabout this entire censorship fiasco? Saudi Arabia was our second episode,\nand you can see right here, it\'s missing. Okay? But in our last episode\xa0\nin December, episode seven,\xa0 we had another segment criticizing MBS,\nand it was called ""Saudi Arabia Update."" Yeah, our episode titles\xa0\nare super straight forward. They\'re like an email from your parents. The subject line tells you\xa0\nexactly what you\'re gonna get. ""Subject: Hasan,\xa0\nI have a question about the Roku. Email: Hasan,\xa0\nI have a question about the Roku."" That episode\xa0is still streaming\xa0\non Netflix in\xa0Saudi Arabia. If you\'re going to crush\xa0\nall forms of dissent, don\'t half-ass it. But that\'s what happens\xa0\nwhen you got a country\xa0 that\'s run by people who got their job\xa0\njust because of their dad. Now, here\'s the irony. By censoring our episode,\nSaudi Arabia made us go viral Have they never heard\xa0\nof the Streisand Effect? It was great for the show,\xa0\nI got 60 new IG\xa0followers. It was great. This story... got covered by everyone\xa0\nacross the political spectrum. For the first time in my life,\xa0\nI was a bipartisan icon. Yes! [cheering] Liberals and conservatives, they both embraced me\xa0\nlike I was money from Big Pharma. Cory Booker just bear hugged me like...\n[roars] ""Get over here, buddy."" Even Breitbart defended me. Breitbart! You know how hard it was for Breitbart? They had to look at a picture of me\nand MBS and be like, ""Which one is browner? Is there a third option to hate?"" So hard for them. Let me be absolutely clear, I\'m not a victim here at all.\nI\'m lucky, okay? I have the freedom to call Saudi Arabia\xa0\n""The Boy Band Manager of 9/11."" I can criticize my own government\nwithout any fear of repercussions. I can say Stephen Miller\xa0\ndeported his own hair for being brown. I can say those things... but those freedoms don\'t exist\xa0\nin Saudi Arabia. Dozens of activists\xa0sit in Saudi jails,\nmany without formal charges. So while I can make a joke\xa0\nabout being a ""cyber-criminal,"" this is no joke for many Saudi activists. According to Reprieve,  a human rights advocacy group,\xa0\nthat vague cybercrime law\xa0 that we allegedly broke, it is the very same law\xa0\nthat is regularly cited in Saudi court to justify death sentences,\xa0\nlike in the case of Ali al-Nimr, a teenager who was sentenced to death\nfor protesting and using his BlackBerry to spread information about protests. This isn\'t about just censoring\xa0\none episode of a TV show, it\'s about the\xa0precedent. Because as tech companies keep expanding, they\'re going to keep running into\nmore vague censorship laws. Laws that can allow governments\xa0\nto pull any content at any time. Ultimately, \xa0\nSaudi doesn\'t care about ""immoral content"" that impinges on ""religious values."" They\'re mad that a Muslim\nis airing out their dirty laundry. Now, look.\nI\'ve already been banned in one country. So I was thinking, ""Look,\nyou\'re not built for this beef. Let\'s talk about something\xa0\na little less controversial."" China. Don\'t worry! Netflix isn\'t in China. The only thing they binge watch\xa0\nis their own people. China, of course,\xa0\nhas some of the toughest restrictions\xa0 on the Internet. No Facebook.\xa0No YouTube. [man] The Chinese Communist Party enforces\na draconian system of censorship, dictating what Chinese can search,\nand they\'ve done it for years. If you go to sites like Twitter,\xa0\nGoogle and Facebook, this is what you get. If you can\'t see that screen,\xa0\nthat\'s exactly the point. China controlling its Internet\nis a remarkable accomplishment that America never thought\xa0\nwould be possible. Now, there\'s no question\xa0China has been... trying to crack down on the Internet.\n[chuckles] Good luck. That\'s sort of like\xa0trying to nail Jell-O\nto the wall. That is such a creepy clip\xa0\nto watch right now. Not just because\xa0\nof how wrong he was about China. But because we\'re all picturing him\nnailing Jell-O to the wall in the same way, right? With his penis? Okay, good. For China\'s 1.4 billion citizens\nand 800 million Internet users, censorship is just part of life. China is so good at censorship,\nthey gave themselves five stars. In China,\ncensorship is a complex ecosystem\xa0 of human beings,\ntelecom and tech companies and laws that all gives\nthe Communist Party and China\'s president Xi Jinping\xa0\nthe ability to control what can be seen on the Internet\nin real time. It\'s something known as\n""\'The Great Firewall,"" which I know sounds like\xa0\na dessert at PF Chang\'s,\xa0 but there are whole pieces\xa0\nof Chinese history that the government\xa0 doesn\'t allow to be taught in schools. And they\'ve been scrubbed\xa0\nfrom the Internet. The last major political protest in China\xa0\nwas the spring of 1989. Thousands of people gathered\xa0\nin Tiananmen Square to protest for democratic reforms. But on June 4, 1989, the Chinese Army\xa0\nopen fire on the crowd, killing citizens. And here are some Chinese millennials, \ntoday being asked about it. Do you learn about\xa0Tiananmen Square\nin history books? Not mentioned. -[woman] Yeah, not mentioned.\n-Not mentioned at all? That\'s crazy. That\'s like asking a kid\xa0\nin high school, in America, if 9/11 is in their history book\nand they\'re like, ""9/11? The day Jay-Z came out\xa0\nwith The Blueprint? You\'d be like,\xa0\n""How is that in your history book?"" So, if you\'re Chinese \nand you\'re living in a world where the government decides\xa0\nwhat you can and can\'t see, that must be some sort of\xa0\ndystopian nightmare, right? You\'re in China, the government can know\xa0\neverything about you. The government already know\xa0\neverything about me. It\'s just if I\'m not committing a crime,\xa0\nI don\'t give a shit. The bottom line is the Chinese in general\nare less concerned about data privacy than the consumers out in the West. There\'s some subtle rules in China,\nbut if you follow it,  and respect it,  you still have\xa0\nthe freedom to experience it. Remember, this is a rap battle organizer telling you to follow the rules. What a fucking nerd! If NWA started in China, ""Fuck the Police""\nwould have been called, ""Sorry, officer.\nI\'ll try to be more careful next time."" Yes, websites like Google,\xa0Twitter,\nFacebook and YouTube are all blocked, but no one cares because\xa0\nthey all have great Chinese doppelgangers like Baidu, Weibo, Youku \nand WeChat,\xa0 which blows Facebook out of the water. Life under censorship is pretty good. If you\'re just taking selfies, being thick\non Youku or shitposting on Weibo and... To anyone over 35, I swear to God,\nmost of those words were English. However, if you\'re an activist,\nthis is where things can get very scary. Especially under China\'s president,\nXi Jinping. Since coming to power, he has crushed all forms of dissent. China is carrying out a broad crackdown\non people accused\xa0 of spreading so-called rumors online. Chung Ai-Ja, a former school counselor, showed us the message\xa0\nshe reposted on social media, an apparent jab\xa0\nat China\'s President Xi Jinping. Police showed up at her school\xa0\nto question her and days later, she was fired. Someone got fired\nfor insulting the president online? That\'s the only way to get a job\xa0\nin my industry right now. How\'d this all happen? President Xi has clamped down on NGOs,\nlocked up human rights lawyers and issued sweeping new cybercrime laws,\xa0\nhe even temporarily bans words\xa0 and phrases like, ""I disagree,""\n""I oppose"" and ""my Emperor."" Words that question his authority\xa0\nand for some reason, he\'s also banned the words,\xa0\n""roll up sleeves""\xa0 and ""I\'m willing to be a vegetarian\nfor the rest of my life."" I feel like the only explanation is that\nPresident Xi had his heart broken by a stubborn vegetarian\xa0\nwith beautiful forearms. And he\'s like, ""It is now illegal\xa0\nto remind me of her! God, I miss Susan so much."" Xi isn\'t just censoring words\xa0\nand historic events, he is censoring huge news stories\xa0\nin real-time. The Communist Party in China\nis persecuting a Muslim minority group called Uighurs. But if you live in China,\nchances are you don\'t know any of this. [woman] Across the Northwestern province\xa0\nof Xinjiang, an estimated one million Chinese Muslims\xa0\nhave vanished into a vast network\xa0 of detention enters for what China calls\n""re-education."" [man] After initially denying\nthe existence of prison camps,  Beijing now says it is sending \nan unspecified number of people\xa0 for vocational training free of charge. Vocational training free of charge. Oh, I get it. America never had \nJapanese internment camps. Those were desert getaways\xa0\nfor the Asian-American community. North Korea doesn\'t have labor camps,\xa0\nthey\'re WeWorks. There\'s no Wi-Fi.\xa0\nEveryone is just really efficient. There\'s one more. You guys are like,\n""Is he gonna keep going?"" There\'s a third.\xa0\nBangladesh doesn\'t have sweatshops. Those are Bikram work spaces. China doesn\'t want the world to know\xa0\nwhat\'s really happening\xa0 in the detention centers.\xa0\nOnline people have to move fast\xa0 to get information \nbefore the government takes it down. and this is probably how it\'s going to be\nfor quite some time. China\'s ruling Communist Party\xa0\nproposed Sunday to remove term limits\xa0 on the office of President. That means Xi Jinping who heads the party\xa0\nand the military may never have to leave office. Xi Jinping will never retire. It\'s the one thing he has in common\xa0\nwith millennials. Xi promotes a policy of cyber-sovereignty,\nwhich he defines\xa0 as the idea that China has the right\xa0\nto control information within its borders\xa0 and block whatever the CCP deems harmful. It basically lets them take down anything\nthey want, whenever they want. Even if it\'s completely random. Okay, so the British children\'s show\nPeppa Pig is very popular with kids worldwide,\nbut it\'s being banned in China for an unexpected reason. The sassy cartoon character has come\xa0\nto be associated with counterculture. [woman]\nShe allegedly promotes gangster attitudes. Peppa Pig is a gangsta? Is Thomas the Tank Engine\xa0\ntransporting Special K? What is going on? At some point,\nthe ban on Peppa Pig was lifted\xa0 and that\'s why censorship\xa0\nis such a mind fuck in China. The government is constantly changing\nwhat\'s allowed and what\'s not. So activists and censors\xa0are\xa0\nin a constant game of cat and mouse. Activists are constantly having to find\nnew ways to evade the censors\xa0 and then censors are always looking\xa0\nfor new ways to silence the activists. Take the case of Chen Guangcheng, known as CGC or the Blind Lawyer. [man] The Blind Lawyer became an icon \nof human rights abuses in China after he exposed the way thousands\xa0\nof women had undergone forced abortions. For seven years, he was held here\nunder illegal house arrest. He and his family beaten savagely,\nguarded round the clock. Activists started the hashtag #freeCGC\non social media and then censors immediately blocked\xa0\nall the hashtags. To get around the censors,\nactivists then asked supporters to post selfies dressed up\xa0\nas the Blind Lawyer. And they did,\nand the response was incredible. Even though they all look like\xa0\nthey\'re auditioning to play BBQ Becky. But then something crazy happened. Mr. Chen has spent the last 18 months\xa0\nunder house arrest, but last Sunday, he escaped. A blind lawyer escaped house arrest? Can you imagine being the guard that let a blind lawyer\nslip away? How could both of them not see anything? As people started finding out\xa0\nChen escaped, censors got to work, taking down his initials\nand even the words ""blind man."" To get around the censors,\xa0\nactivists hit back\xa0 with an incredibly powerful weapon. Memes. Now, I know in America, memes are\xa0\njust used to humanize Squidward, but in China,\nthey\'re also a popular tool for dissent. In the case of the blind lawyer,\nthis meme went viral. Yeah, that\'s the pig from Angry Birds, staring at the tunnel\nin the Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank memes became so popular, the censors blocked any mention\xa0\nof The Shawshank Redemption. By the way,\nfor any people watching in China, Tim Robbins escapes from prison. You totally don\'t see it coming,\xa0\nkind of like the blind lawyer escaping. Clearly, the CCP always has the upper hand\nwhen it comes to censoring content. They have the resources,\xa0\nthe infrastructure, the manpower,\xa0 all of which makes it really hard\xa0\nfor any grassroots movement\xa0 to gain momentum. However... in the last year,\xa0\nthere\'s been a new movement  that has started to take hold in China, and it may be unlike anything\xa0\nthat has ever come before it.  [woman] #MeToo, in the US it\'s been\xa0\nchampioned by celebrities. In China, it\'s a fledgling movement\nled mainly by university students. China\'s #MeToo movement\xa0\nhas been called\xa0 one of the first coordinated student\xa0\nprotest movements since Tiananmen Square. The #MeToo movement is a unique problem\xa0\nfor the CCP\xa0 because the Communist Party is technically\nfounded on egalitarian principles, the same way America\xa0is technically\xa0\nfounded on the idea of democracy. And Maroon 5 is technically founded\xa0\non the idea of music. Even from the CCP\'s early days,\xa0\nMao famously said, ""Women hold up half the sky.""\nThe CCP\'s doctrine is equality for all. But that hasn\'t stopped them\xa0\nfrom telling women what to do with their bodies. Once notorious\xa0\nfor its strict one-child policy, China now considering proposals\nto push women to have more babies. Beijing is worried that having one\xa0\nof the lowest birth rates in the world will undermine its efforts\xa0\nto stimulate the economy. For years, they outlawed\xa0\nhaving more than one child. Now, they\'re trying to shame single women\ninto getting married  and having babies\xa0\nby calling them ""leftover women."" Even Mike Pence wouldn\'t support this,\nhe\'d be like,  ""Look, government isn\'t about\nforcing women to have babies. it\'s about forcing women to keep them. Keep your eye on the ball, Xi."" And he\'s like, ""I\'m sorry. I can\'t stop thinking about Susan. Maybe I should have compromised\xa0\nand been a vegetarian."" How insecure are you, CCP? They\'re basically one step away\xa0\nfrom passing a law that says, all Chinese men have girlfriends. They just go\xa0\nto a different high school, okay? But now that\xa0#MeToo has surfaced, it\'s clear women have had enough. They want the CCP to make good on the founding values\xa0\nof the party, equality. And they\'re speaking out online in a way\nthey never have before. Despite censorship, a huge part\xa0\nof why\xa0#MeToo has taken off\xa0 is because of social media.\n#MeToo in China effectively started on January 1, 2018, after Luo Xixi,\na former PhD student posted on social media\xa0\nclaiming she\'d been sexually assaulted by her adviser in 2004, which he denied. But the post blew up. Since Luo Xixi first reported the abuse\xa0\non Sina Weibo on January 1st, her complaint has been viewed\xa0\naround five million times. [woman\'s voice] I stepped up simply because \nI don\'t want other people to get hurt. But the discussion\xa0\nand the reactions on the Internet and in Chinese society\xa0\nhave really surprised me. Censors eventually took down\xa0a majority\xa0\nof the\xa0#MeToo posts\xa0 and the variations of the hashtag. That\'s when the arms race began. To dodge the sensors,\xa0China\'s women\xa0\nstarted using Chinese words\xa0 that sounded similar to ""Me Too."" So, in Chinese ""mi"" means ""rice""\nand ""tù"" means ""bunny,"" so China\'s #MeToo activists\nbecame rice bunnies. Which if you listen to it, it kind of sounds like something\xa0\nSteve Harvey got fired for saying. He\'s like,\n""Hey, what\'s up, you rice bunny?"" And they\'re like, ""Steve! Why are you saying that?""\nAnd he\'s like, ""Think like a man."" Activists posted rotated photos of text,\nwhich makes messages unsearchable. It even used blockchain \nto make a #MeToo letter harder to delete, and that totally makes sense because\nno one knows what the fuck blockchain is. Bitcoin\'s at 3,000. Since Luo Xixi\'s story hit Weibo,\xa0 thousands of students have petitioned\xa0\ntheir colleges for anti-harassment policies.\xa0\nThis is a big deal,\xa0 because in China,\xa0\nsexual harassment is rampant. [woman] A survey of 7,000 students\xa0\nby NGO, the Guangzhou Gender Center, found while almost 70% of respondents\xa0\nhad been sexually harassed, only 4% reported it to the authorities. More than 50% of female commuters\nhave been assaulted while riding China\'s subways. Dozens of women have come forward\xa0\nto accuse some pretty high-profile men. Like TV host Zhu Jun. He was accused\xa0\nby a woman named Zhou Xiaoxuan, who claims he harassed her\xa0\nwhen she was a 20-year-old intern and he was almost 50. Zhu has denied the allegations, but this was a huge deal because Zhu Jun\xa0\nis one of China\'s most famous TV anchors known for hosting\xa0\nthe state New Year\'s Gala. [rooster crowing] [singing in Chinese] That was Zhu Jun\xa0\nwith a bunch of spring chickens,  which also happens to be\xa0\nhis ideal age range on Tinder. Now, a big reason why so many women\nhave had to turn to social media is because if you\'re assaulted or harassed,\nthere are very few good legal options. China\'s legal system is poorly set up\xa0\nfor dealing with assault allegations. [man] There\'s no legal definition\xa0\nof sexual harassment here and no standardized way \nof reporting\xa0sexual assault. China has very little recourse\nfor victims of sexual assault, and that\'s something\xa0activists\xa0\nhave been fighting to change long before\xa0#MeToo.\xa0\nActivists like Liang Xiaowen. She has organized protests\xa0\nand co-founded a grassroots feminist NGO, which are risky things to do in China. So I sat down with her\xa0\nto talk about her work The world is kind of hostile to women\nwho want things. It scares people because\xa0\nwomen are standing up. Tell me about the things that\xa0\nyour family has had to go through\xa0 because of your activism. Years ago,\xa0I was trying to host a seminar\xa0\nabout women\'s rights, but then I received a call from my dad. He told me that not only the local police but also\xa0his employer,\xa0\nhis boss is at his home now. So the police went to\xa0friends\xa0\nand co-workers -to talk to your dad?\n-Yes. And the parents would go,\xa0\n""Please don\'t do this."" And that generally works\xa0\nbecause Asian parents can crush dreams. Yeah. You hear that? That\'s the sigh of a thousand ""A minuses."" No. President Xi doing this... is some straight-up Naila Aunty bullshit. Like, ""I\'m not gonna go to you directly. I\'ll find the parents\xa0\nto crush their dreams."" And because of pressure from the police\nthrough the parents\xa0 and her family,\xa0\nXiaowen came to the United States to study and to continue to fight\xa0\nfor women\'s rights in China. What does the Chinese government think about the work you\'re doing? The Chinese government would consider us\xa0\nto be Western hostile forces or being controlled\xa0\nby Western hostile forces. What would they consider me? Well, if you were that important, then they would consider you\nas Western hostile forces-- -Are you saying I\'m not important?\n-Not in China. -I\'m sorry.\n-Have they seen the show? -I have seen your show.\n-No, but have they seen the show? -What show?\n-The show you\'re on. -This show.\n-I don\'t know. But if I\'m in it, I promise that,\xa0\nat least, some people will see it. Have they seen\xa0The Spy Who Dumped Me? No, I don\'t know. I mean, I haven\'t. Did they see MTV\'s Disaster Date\nseason four? Now you are just making things up. No, I\'m not! Listen, Party Rock Anthem \nhad come out that year, and I thought Redfoo was going to be\xa0\nthe next Justin Timberlake. Okay, Xiaowen\'s credits\xa0\nare a bit more impressive than mine. She has worked closely with a group called\nthe Feminist Five, who made international headlines\xa0back\nin 2015. [singing in Chinese] [man] These women are singing\xa0\non the Beijing Subway to raise awareness\xa0\nagainst abuse and discrimination. And here, dressing up\xa0\nis blood-stained brides\xa0 to encourage women to stand up\nagainst domestic violence,\xa0 but five of these women\xa0\nwere detained recently  for what authorities called,\n""picking quarrels."" It is hilarious to me\xa0\nthat men relegated women to secretarial work for decades, and now we turn around, and we\'re like, ""Where did these women learn to organize\nand plan meetings? Who is responsible for this? Why are they picking quarrels?"" The global backlash\xa0\nto the detention on the Feminist Five\xa0 was so intense,\xa0\nthe CCP actually released the women after 37 days. I was going to be sentenced\nover five years. They didn\'t beat me. Yeah, they don\'t touch me\xa0\nand maybe due to the-- A lot of pressure from... internal and external. If they insulted my sexual orientation,\nit doesn\'t work, That\'s it. \'Cause I\'m a lesbian. What\'s wrong?\xa0What\'s up? Yeah, the CCP thought\nPeppa Pig was gangsta? Nah, this is gangsta. Just a few months after\xa0\nthe Five were released, President Xi spoke\nat the UN Women\'s Conference and said this... [woman\'s voice]\nIn many parts of the world however, disparities remain\xa0\nin the level of women\'s development. As we speak... various forms of discrimination\xa0\nagainst women are still taking place. Hmm... Interesting choice\xa0\nto use a female translator. He\'s like see, ""I give women a voice. What\'s next? Susan."" In the past year,\xa0\n#MeToo has made some gains. What is the biggest victory\xa0\nthat you\'ve seen, at the government level, of your activism? The first one happened last year, the new civil code explicitly... said that employers should not\xa0\nsexually harass employees. And the second,\xa0\nnow people can sue under sexual harassment and gender discrimination. -That\'s major.\n-It is. The CCP has agreed to add a definition\xa0\nof sexual harassment to China\'s civil code\xa0\nand the Supreme Court says, you can now file\xa0\na sexual harassment lawsuit\xa0 for the first time in China. Remember creepy TV host Zhu Jun?\xa0\xa0\nSpring chickens? Remember him? Yes. He actually sued his accuser,\nZhou Xiaoxuan, and then she counter-sued him\nand is now trying to make her case\xa0 a sexual harassment lawsuit,\nand if it is accepted by the court,\xa0 it would be the first-ever civil\xa0\nsexual harassment lawsuit  in Chinese history. This is very different\xa0\nin the #MeToo movement. People just don\'t let it go away anymore. People want these universities\nto say something, to do something, to change the situation. It\'s not what it\'s like before. People have suffered enough,\nyoung women have suffered enough. They want-- They demand changes. The CCP and President Xi\xa0\nare doing everything they can\xa0 to consolidate power\nand silence anyone who speaks out. China\'s #MeToo movement is persisting\nin the face of censorship, and it is inspiring, and we can only hope \nthat these small victories\xa0 will lead to even larger ones.']"
28,0,How one tweet can ruin your life | Jon Ronson,"For the longest time Jon Ronson reveled in the fact that Twitter gave a voice to the voiceless ... the social media platform gave us all a chance to speak up and hit back at perceived injustice.

In this passionate, eloquent talk, Ronson explains how too often we end up behaving like a baying mob — and that it's time to rethink how we interact with others online.TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

People would admit\nshameful secrets about themselves, and other people would say,\n""Oh my God, I\'m exactly the same."" Voiceless people realized\nthat they had a voice, and it was powerful and eloquent. If a newspaper ran some racist\nor homophobic column, we realized we could do\nsomething about it. We could get them. We could hit them with a weapon\nthat we understood but they didn\'t -- a social media shaming. Advertisers would withdraw\ntheir advertising. When powerful people\nmisused their privilege, we were going to get them. This was like the\ndemocratization of justice. Hierarchies were being leveled out. We were going to do things better. Soon after that, a disgraced\npop science writer called Jonah Lehrer -- he\'d been caught plagiarizing\nand faking quotes, and he was drenched in shame\nand regret, he told me. And he had the opportunity to publicly apologize\nat a foundation lunch. This was going to be the most\nimportant speech of his life. Maybe it would win him some salvation. He knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be\nlive-streaming his event, but what he didn\'t know\nuntil he turned up, was that they\'d erected a giant screen\nTwitter feed right next to his head. (Laughter) Another one in a monitor screen\nin his eye line. I don\'t think the foundation did this\nbecause they were monstrous. I think they were clueless:\nI think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasingly\nhorrific reality. And here were some of the Tweets\nthat were cascading into his eye line, as he was trying to apologize: ""Jonah Lehrer, boring us\ninto forgiving him."" (Laughter) And, ""Jonah Lehrer has not proven\nthat he is capable of feeling shame."" That one must have been written\nby the best psychiatrist ever, to know that about such\na tiny figure behind a lectern. And, ""Jonah Lehrer is just\na frigging sociopath."" That last word is a very human thing\nto do, to dehumanize the people we hurt. It\'s because we want to destroy people\nbut not feel bad about it. Imagine if this was an actual court, and the accused was in the dark,\nbegging for another chance, and the jury was yelling out, ""Bored! Sociopath!"" (Laughter) You know, when we watch\ncourtroom dramas, we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney, but give us the power,\nand we become like hanging judges. Power shifts fast. We were getting Jonah because he was\nperceived to have misused his privilege, but Jonah was on the floor then,\nand we were still kicking, and congratulating ourselves\nfor punching up. And it began to feel weird and empty\nwhen there wasn\'t a powerful person who had misused their privilege\nthat we could get. A day without a shaming\nbegan to feel like a day picking fingernails and treading water. Let me tell you a story. It\'s about a woman called Justine Sacco. She was a PR woman from New York\nwith 170 Twitter followers, and she\'d Tweet little\nacerbic jokes to them, like this one on a plane\nfrom New York to London: [Weird German Dude: You\'re in first class.\nIt\'s 2014. Get some deodorant."" -Inner monologue as inhale BO.\nThank god for pharmaceuticals.] So Justine chuckled to herself,\nand pressed send, and got no replies, and felt that sad feeling that we all feel when the Internet doesn\'t\ncongratulate us for being funny. (Laughter) Black silence when the Internet\ndoesn\'t talk back. And then she got to Heathrow,\nand she had a little time to spare before her final leg, so she thought up\nanother funny little acerbic joke: [Going to Africa. Hope I don\'t get AIDS.\nJust kidding. I\'m white!] And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,\ngot on the plane, got no replies, turned off her phone, fell asleep, woke up 11 hours later, turned on her phone while the plane\nwas taxiing on the runway, and straightaway there was\na message from somebody that she hadn\'t spoken\nto since high school, that said, ""I am so sorry\nto see what\'s happening to you."" And then another message\nfrom a best friend, ""You need to call me right now. You are the worldwide number one\ntrending topic on Twitter."" (Laughter) What had happened is that one\nof her 170 followers had sent the Tweet to a Gawker journalist, and he\nretweeted it to his 15,000 followers: [And now, a funny holiday joke\nfrom IAC\'s PR boss] And then it was like a bolt of lightning. A few weeks later, I talked\nto the Gawker journalist. I emailed him and asked him how it felt,\nand he said, ""It felt delicious."" And then he said,\n""But I\'m sure she\'s fine."" But she wasn\'t fine,\nbecause while she slept, Twitter took control of her life\nand dismantled it piece by piece. First there were the philanthropists: [If @JustineSacco\'s unfortunate\nwords ... bother you, join me in supporting\n@CARE\'s work in Africa.] [In light of ... disgusting,\nracist tweet, I\'m donating to @care today] Then came the beyond horrified: [... no words for that horribly disgusting\nracist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco. I am beyond horrified.] Was anybody on Twitter\nthat night? A few of you. Did Justine\'s joke overwhelm\nyour Twitter feed the way it did mine? It did mine, and I thought\nwhat everybody thought that night, which was, ""Wow, somebody\'s screwed! Somebody\'s life is about to get terrible!"" And I sat up in my bed, and I put the pillow behind my head, and then I thought, I\'m not entirely sure\nthat joke was intended to be racist. Maybe instead of gleefully\nflaunting her privilege, she was mocking the gleeful\nflaunting of privilege. There\'s a comedy tradition of this, like South Park or Colbert\nor Randy Newman. Maybe Justine Sacco\'s crime was not being\nas good at it as Randy Newman. In fact, when I met Justine\na couple of weeks later in a bar, she was just crushed, and I asked her to explain the joke, and she said, ""Living in America\nputs us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on\nin the Third World. I was making of fun of that bubble."" You know, another woman on Twitter that\nnight, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis, she reviewed my book on public shaming\nand wrote that she Tweeted that night, ""I\'m not sure that her joke\nwas intended to be racist,"" and she said straightaway she got\na fury of Tweets saying, ""Well, you\'re just\na privileged bitch, too."" And so to her shame, she wrote, she shut up and watched\nas Justine\'s life got torn apart. It started to get darker: [Everyone go report\nthis cunt @JustineSacco] Then came the calls for her to be fired. [Good luck with the job hunt\nin the new year. #GettingFired] Thousands of people around the world decided it was their duty\nto get her fired. [@JustineSacco last tweet\nof your career. #SorryNotSorry Corporations got involved,\nhoping to sell their products on the back of Justine\'s annihilation: [Next time you plan to tweet something\nstupid before you take off, make sure you are getting\non a @Gogo flight!] (Laughter) A lot of companies were making\ngood money that night. You know, Justine\'s name was normally\nGoogled 40 times a month. That month, between December the 20th\nand the end of December, her name was Googled 1,220,000 times. And one Internet economist told me\nthat that meant that Google made somewhere between 120,000 dollars\nand 468,000 dollars from Justine\'s annihilation, whereas\nthose of us doing the actual shaming -- we got nothing. (Laughter) We were like unpaid\nshaming interns for Google. (Laughter) And then came the trolls: [I\'m actually kind of hoping\nJustine Sacco gets aids? lol] Somebody else on that wrote, ""Somebody HIV-positive should rape\nthis bitch and then we\'ll find out if her skin color protects her from AIDS."" And that person got a free pass. Nobody went after that person. We were all so excited\nabout destroying Justine, and our shaming brains\nare so simple-minded, that we couldn\'t also handle\ndestroying somebody who was inappropriately\ndestroying Justine. Justine was really uniting\na lot of disparate groups that night, from philanthropists to ""rape the bitch."" [@JustineSacco I hope you get fired!\nYou demented bitch... Just let the world know you\'re planning\nto ride bare back while in Africa.] Women always have it worse than men. When a man gets shamed, it\'s,\n""I\'m going to get you fired."" When a woman gets shamed, it\'s, ""I\'m going to get you fired\nand raped and cut out your uterus."" And then Justine\'s employers got involved: [IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an\noutrageous, offensive comment. Employee in question currently\nunreachable on an intl flight.] And that\'s when the anger\nturned to excitement: [All I want for Christmas is to see\n@JustineSacco\'s face when her plane lands and she checks\nher inbox/voicemail. #fired] [Oh man, @justinesacco\nis going to have the most painful phone-turning-on moment ever\nwhen her plane lands.] [We are about to watch this @JustineSacco\nbitch get fired. In REAL time. Before she even KNOWS\nshe\'s getting fired.] What we had was\na delightful narrative arc. We knew something that Justine didn\'t. Can you think of anything\nless judicial than this? Justine was asleep on a plane\nand unable to explain herself, and her inability was\na huge part of the hilarity. On Twitter that night, we were\nlike toddlers crawling towards a gun. Somebody worked out exactly\nwhich plane she was on, so they linked to a flight tracker website. [British Airways Flight 43\nOn-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes] A hashtag began trending worldwide: # hasJustineLandedYet? [It is kinda wild\nto see someone self-destruct without them even being aware of it.\n#hasJustineLandedYet] [Seriously. I just want to go home\nto go to bed, but everyone at the bar is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.\nCan\'t look away. Can\'t leave.] [#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best\nthing to happen to my Friday night.] [Is no one in Cape Town going\nto the airport to tweet her arrival? Come on, twitter! I\'d like pictures] And guess what? Yes there was. [@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed\nat Cape Town international. And if you want to know\nwhat it looks like to discover that you\'ve just been torn to shreds\nbecause of a misconstrued liberal joke, not by trolls, but by nice people like us, this is what it looks like: [... She\'s decided to wear\nsunnies as a disguise.] So why did we do it? I think some people were genuinely upset, but I think for other people, it\'s because Twitter is basically\na mutual approval machine. We surround ourselves with people\nwho feel the same way we do, and we approve each other, and that\'s a really good feeling. And if somebody gets in the way,\nwe screen them out. And do you know what\nthat\'s the opposite of? It\'s the opposite of democracy. We wanted to show that we cared\nabout people dying of AIDS in Africa. Our desire to be seen to be compassionate\nis what led us to commit this profoundly un-compassionate act. As Meghan O\'Gieblyn wrote\nin the Boston Review, ""This isn\'t social justice.\nIt\'s a cathartic alternative."" For the past three years, I\'ve been going around the world\nmeeting people like Justine Sacco -- and believe me, there\'s a lot\nof people like Justine Sacco. There\'s more every day. And we want to think they\'re fine,\nbut they\'re not fine. The people I met were mangled. They talked to me about depression, and anxiety and insomnia\nand suicidal thoughts. One woman I talked to,\nwho also told a joke that landed badly, she stayed home for a year and a half. Before that, she worked with adults\nwith learning difficulties, and was apparently really good at her job. Justine was fired, of course,\nbecause social media demanded it. But it was worse than that. She was losing herself. She was waking up in the middle\nof the night, forgetting who she was. She was got because she was perceived\nto have misused her privilege. And of course, that\'s a much better thing\nto get people for than the things we used to get people for,\nlike having children out of wedlock. But the phrase ""misuse of privilege""\nis becoming a free pass to tear apart pretty much\nanybody we choose to. It\'s becoming a devalued term, and it\'s making us lose\nour capacity for empathy and for distinguishing between serious\nand unserious transgressions. Justine had 170 Twitter followers,\nand so to make it work, she had to be fictionalized. Word got around that she was the daughter\nthe mining billionaire Desmond Sacco. [Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco\nher father is a SA mining billionaire. She\'s not sorry.\nAnd neither is her father.] I thought that was true about Justine, until I met her at a bar, and I asked her\nabout her billionaire father, and she said, ""My father sells carpets."" And I think back on\nthe early days of Twitter, when people would admit\nshameful secrets about themselves, and other people would say,\n""Oh my God, I\'m exactly the same."" These days, the hunt is on\nfor people\'s shameful secrets. You can lead a good, ethical life, but some bad phraseology in a Tweet\ncan overwhelm it all, become a clue to your secret inner evil. Maybe there\'s two types\nof people in the world: those people who favor\nhumans over ideology, and those people who favor\nideology over humans. I favor humans over ideology, but right now, the ideologues are winning, and they\'re creating a stage\nfor constant artificial high dramas where everybody\'s either\na magnificent hero or a sickening villain, even though we know that\'s not true\nabout our fellow humans. What\'s true is that\nwe are clever and stupid; what\'s true is that we\'re grey areas. The great thing about social media\nwas how it gave a voice to voiceless people, but we\'re now creating\na surveillance society, where the smartest way to survive\nis to go back to being voiceless. Let\'s not do that. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon. Jon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno. BG: Don\'t go away. What strikes me about Justine\'s story is also the fact that if you\nGoogle her name today, this story covers the first\n100 pages of Google results -- there is nothing else about her. In your book, you mention another story of another victim who actually got\ntaken on by a reputation management firm, and by creating blogs and posting nice,\ninnocuous stories about her love for cats and holidays and stuff,\nmanaged to get the story off the first couple pages of Google\nresults, but it didn\'t last long. A couple of weeks later, they started\ncreeping back up to the top result. Is this a totally lost battle? Jon Ronson: You know, I think\nthe very best thing we can do, if you see a kind of unfair\nor an ambiguous shaming, is to speak up, because I think\nthe worst thing that happened to Justine was that nobody supported her --\nlike, everyone was against her, and that is profoundly traumatizing, to be told by tens of thousands of people\nthat you need to get out. But if a shaming happens and there\'s\na babble of voices, like in a democracy, where people are discussing it,\nI think that\'s much less damaging. So I think that\'s the way forward, but it\'s hard, because if you do\nstand up for somebody, it\'s incredibly unpleasant. BG: So let\'s talk about your experience, because you stood up by writing this book. By the way, it\'s mandatory\nreading for everybody, okay? You stood up because the book\nactually puts the spotlight on shamers. And I assume you didn\'t only\nhave friendly reactions on Twitter. JR: It didn\'t go down that well\nwith some people. (Laughter) I mean, you don\'t want\nto just concentrate -- because lots of people understood,\nand were really nice about the book. But yeah, for 30 years I\'ve been writing\nstories about abuses of power, and when I say the powerful people\nover there in the military, or in the pharmaceutical industry,\neverybody applauds me. As soon as I say, ""We are the powerful\npeople abusing our power now,"" I get people saying,\n""Well you must be a racist too."" BG: So the other night --\nyesterday -- we were at dinner, and there were two discussions going on. On one side you were talking\nwith people around the table -- and that was a nice,\nconstructive discussion. On the other, every time\nyou turned to your phone, there is this deluge of insults. JR: Yeah. This happened last night.\nWe had like a TED dinner last night. We were chatting and it was lovely\nand nice, and I decided to check Twitter. Somebody said, ""You are\na white supremacist."" And then I went back and had\na nice conversation with somebody, and then I went back to Twitter, somebody said my very existence\nmade the world a worse place. My friend Adam Curtis says that maybe the Internet is like\na John Carpenter movie from the 1980s, when eventually everyone\nwill start screaming at each other and shooting each other,\nand then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer, and I\'m starting to think of that\nas a really nice option. BG: Jon, thank you.\nJR: Thank you, Bruno. (Applause)']"

I didn\'t understand them and, to be honest, I was quite afraid\nto look into them. The first mystery was, I\'m 40 years old, and all throughout my lifetime,\nyear after year, serious depression and anxiety have risen, in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world. And I wanted to understand why. Why is this happening to us? Why is it that with each year that passes, more and more of us are finding it harder\nto get through the day? And I wanted to understand this\nbecause of a more personal mystery. When I was a teenager, I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling,\nlike pain was leaking out of me. I couldn\'t control it, I didn\'t understand why it was happening, I felt quite ashamed of it. And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was well-intentioned, but quite oversimplified. Not totally wrong. My doctor said, ""We know\nwhy people get like this. Some people just naturally get\na chemical imbalance in their heads -- you\'re clearly one of them. All we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemical\nbalance back to normal."" So I started taking a drug\ncalled Paxil or Seroxat, it\'s the same thing with different names\nin different countries. And I felt much better,\nI got a real boost. But not very long afterwards, this feeling of pain started to come back. So I was given higher and higher doses until, for 13 years, I was taking\nthe maximum possible dose that you\'re legally allowed to take. And for a lot of those 13 years,\nand pretty much all the time by the end, I was still in a lot of pain. And I started asking myself,\n""What\'s going on here? Because you\'re doing everything you\'re told to do by the story\nthat\'s dominating the culture -- why do you still feel like this?"" So to get to the bottom\nof these two mysteries, for a book that I\'ve written I ended up going on a big journey\nall over the world, I traveled over 40,000 miles. I wanted to sit with the leading\nexperts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially, what solves them, and people who have come through\ndepression and anxiety and out the other side\nin all sorts of ways. And I learned a huge amount from the amazing people\nI got to know along the way. But I think at the heart\nof what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for nine different causes\nof depression and anxiety. Two of them are indeed in our biology. Your genes can make you\nmore sensitive to these problems, though they don\'t write your destiny. And there are real brain changes\nthat can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. But most of the factors\nthat have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology. They are factors in the way we live. And once you understand them, it opens up a very different\nset of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the option\nof chemical antidepressants. For example, if you\'re lonely, you\'re more likely\nto become depressed. If, when you go to work,\nyou don\'t have any control over your job, you\'ve just got to do what you\'re told, you\'re more likely to become depressed. If you very rarely get out\ninto the natural world, you\'re more likely to become depressed. And one thing unites a lot of the causes\nof depression and anxiety that I learned about. Not all of them, but a lot of them. Everyone here knows you\'ve all got natural\nphysical needs, right? Obviously. You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. If I took those things away from you, you\'d all be in real trouble, real fast. But at the same time, every human being\nhas natural psychological needs. You need to feel you belong. You need to feel your life\nhas meaning and purpose. You need to feel that people\nsee you and value you. You need to feel you\'ve got\na future that makes sense. And this culture we built\nis good at lots of things. And many things are better\nthan in the past -- I\'m glad to be alive today. But we\'ve been getting less and less good at meeting these deep,\nunderlying psychological needs. And it\'s not the only thing\nthat\'s going on, but I think it\'s the key reason\nwhy this crisis keeps rising and rising. And I found this really hard to absorb. I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depression\nas just a problem in my brain, to one with many causes, including many in the way we\'re living. And it only really began\nto fall into place for me when one day, I went to interview\na South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. He\'s a great guy. And Dr. Summerfield\nhappened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introduced\nchemical antidepressants for people in that country. And the local doctors, the Cambodians,\nhad never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explained. And they said to him, ""We don\'t need them,\nwe\'ve already got antidepressants."" And he was like, ""What do you mean?"" He thought they were going to talk about\nsome kind of herbal remedy, like St. John\'s Wort, ginkgo biloba,\nsomething like that. Instead, they told him a story. There was a farmer in their community\nwho worked in the rice fields. And one day, he stood on a land mine left over from the war\nwith the United States, and he got his leg blown off. So they him an artificial leg, and after a while, he went back\nto work in the rice fields. But apparently, it\'s super painful\nto work under water when you\'ve got an artificial limb, and I\'m guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field\nwhere he got blown up. The guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out of bed, he developed all the symptoms\nof classic depression. The Cambodian doctor said, ""This is when we gave him\nan antidepressant."" And Dr. Summerfield said,\n""What was it?"" They explained that they went\nand sat with him. They listened to him. They realized that his pain made sense -- it was hard for him to see it\nin the throes of his depression, but actually, it had perfectly\nunderstandable causes in his life. One of the doctors, talking to the people\nin the community, figured, ""You know, if we bought this guy a cow, he could become a dairy farmer, he wouldn\'t be in this position\nthat was screwing him up so much, he wouldn\'t have to go\nand work in the rice fields."" So they bought him a cow. Within a couple of weeks,\nhis crying stopped, within a month, his depression was gone. They said to doctor Summerfield, ""So you see, doctor, that cow,\nthat was an antidepressant, that\'s what you mean, right?"" (Laughter) (Applause) If you\'d been raised to think\nabout depression the way I was, and most of the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? ""I went to my doctor\nfor an antidepressant, she gave me a cow."" But what those Cambodian\ndoctors knew intuitively, based on this individual,\nunscientific anecdote, is what the leading\nmedical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. If you\'re depressed, if you\'re anxious, you\'re not weak, you\'re not crazy, you\'re not, in the main,\na machine with broken parts. You\'re a human being with unmet needs. And it\'s just as important to think here\nabout what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organization\nare not saying. They did not say to this farmer, ""Hey, buddy, you need\nto pull yourself together. It\'s your job to figure out\nand fix this problem on your own."" On the contrary, what they said is, ""We\'re here as a group\nto pull together with you, so together, we can figure out\nand fix this problem."" This is what every depressed person needs, and it\'s what every\ndepressed person deserves. This is why one of the leading\ndoctors at the United Nations, in their official statement\nfor World Health Day, couple of years back in 2017, said we need to talk less\nabout chemical imbalances and more about the imbalances\nin the way we live. Drugs give real relief to some people -- they gave relief to me for a while -- but precisely because this problem\ngoes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. But when I first learned that, I remember thinking, ""OK, I could see\nall the scientific evidence, I read a huge number of studies, I interviewed a huge number of the experts\nwho were explaining this,"" but I kept thinking, ""How can we\npossibly do that?"" The things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complex\nthan what was going on with this Cambodian farmer. Where do we even begin with that insight? But then, in the long journey for my book, all over the world, I kept meeting people\nwho were doing exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo. I kept meeting people\nwho were understanding the deeper causes\nof depression and anxiety and, as groups, fixing them. Obviously, I can\'t tell you\nabout all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about, or all of the nine causes of depression\nand anxiety that I learned about, because they won\'t let me give\na 10-hour TED Talk -- you can complain about that to them. But I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutions\nthat emerge from them, if that\'s alright. Here\'s the first. We are the loneliest society\nin human history. There was a recent study\nthat asked Americans, ""Do you feel like you\'re no longer\nclose to anyone?"" And 39 percent of people\nsaid that described them. ""No longer close to anyone."" In the international\nmeasurements of loneliness, Britain and the rest of Europe\nare just behind the US, in case anyone here is feeling smug. (Laughter) I spent a lot of time discussing this with the leading expert\nin the world on loneliness, an incredible man\nnamed professor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago, and I thought a lot about one question\nhis work poses to us. Professor Cacioppo asked, ""Why do we exist? Why are we here, why are we alive?"" One key reason is that our ancestors\non the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing. They weren\'t bigger than the animals\nthey took down a lot of the time, they weren\'t faster than the animals\nthey took down a lot of the time, but they were much better\nat banding together into groups and cooperating. This was our superpower as a species -- we band together, just like bees evolved to live in a hive, humans evolved to live in a tribe. And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes. And it is making us feel awful. But it doesn\'t have to be this way. One of the heroes in my book,\nand in fact, in my life, is a doctor named Sam Everington. He\'s a general practitioner\nin a poor part of East London, where I lived for many years. And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible\ndepression and anxiety. And like me, he\'s not opposed\nto chemical antidepressants, he thinks they give\nsome relief to some people. But he could see two things. Firstly, his patients were depressed\nand anxious a lot of the time for totally understandable\nreasons, like loneliness. And secondly, although the drugs\nwere giving some relief to some people, for many people,\nthey didn\'t solve the problem. The underlying problem. One day, Sam decided\nto pioneer a different approach. A woman came to his center,\nhis medical center, called Lisa Cunningham. I got to know Lisa later. And Lisa had been shut away in her home\nwith crippling depression and anxiety for seven years. And when she came to Sam\'s center,\nshe was told, ""Don\'t worry, we\'ll carry on giving you these drugs, but we\'re also going to prescribe\nsomething else. We\'re going to prescribe for you\nto come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group of other\ndepressed and anxious people, not to talk about how miserable you are, but to figure out something\nmeaningful you can all do together so you won\'t be lonely and you won\'t feel\nlike life is pointless."" The first time this group met, Lisa literally started\nvomiting with anxiety, it was so overwhelming for her. But people rubbed her back,\nthe group started talking, they were like, ""What could we do?"" These are inner-city,\nEast London people like me, they didn\'t know anything about gardening. They were like, ""Why don\'t we\nlearn gardening?"" There was an area\nbehind the doctors\' offices that was just scrubland. ""Why don\'t we make this into a garden?"" They started to take books\nout of the library, started to watch YouTube clips. They started to get\ntheir fingers in the soil. They started to learn\nthe rhythms of the seasons. There\'s a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant. But they started to do something\neven more important. They started to form a tribe. They started to form a group. They started to care about each other. If one of them didn\'t show up, the others would go\nlooking for them -- ""Are you OK?"" Help them figure out\nwhat was troubling them that day. The way Lisa put it to me, ""As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom."" This approach is called\nsocial prescribing, it\'s spreading all over Europe. And there\'s a small,\nbut growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce real\nand meaningful falls in depression and anxiety. And one day, I remember\nstanding in the garden that Lisa and her once-depressed\nfriends had built -- it\'s a really beautiful garden -- and having this thought, it\'s very much inspired by a guy\ncalled professor Hugh Mackay in Australia. I was thinking, so often\nwhen people feel down in this culture, what we say to them -- I\'m sure\neveryone here said it, I have -- we say, ""You just need\nto be you, be yourself."" And I\'ve realized, actually,\nwhat we should say to people is, ""Don\'t be you. Don\'t be yourself. Be us, be we. Be part of a group."" (Applause) The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing\nmore and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- that\'s partly what got us in this crisis. It lies on reconnecting\nwith something bigger than you. And that really connects\nto one of the other causes of depression and anxiety\nthat I wanted to talk to you about. So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets\nand made us physically sick. I don\'t say that\nwith any sense of superiority, I literally came to give\nthis talk from McDonald\'s. I saw all of you eating that\nhealthy TED breakfast, I was like no way. But just like junk food has taken over\nour diets and made us physically sick, a kind of junk values\nhave taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. For thousands of years,\nphilosophers have said, if you think life is about money,\nand status and showing off, you\'re going to feel like crap. That\'s not an exact quote\nfrom Schopenhauer, but that is the gist of what he said. But weirdly, hardy anyone\nhad scientifically investigated this, until a truly extraordinary person\nI got to know, named professor Tim Kasser, who\'s at Knox College in Illinois, and he\'s been researching this\nfor about 30 years now. And his research suggests\nseveral really important things. Firstly, the more you believe you can buy and display\nyour way out of sadness, and into a good life, the more likely you are to become\ndepressed and anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become\nmuch more driven by these beliefs. All throughout my lifetime, under the weight of advertising\nand Instagram and everything like them. And as I thought about this, I realized it\'s like we\'ve all been fed\nsince birth, a kind of KFC for the soul. We\'ve been trained to look for happiness\nin all the wrong places, and just like junk food\ndoesn\'t meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible, junk values don\'t meet\nyour psychological needs, and they take you away from a good life. But when I first spent time\nwith professor Kasser and I was learning all this, I felt a really weird mixture of emotions. Because on the one hand,\nI found this really challenging. I could see how often\nin my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kind of\nshow-offy, grand external solution. And I could see why that\ndid not work well for me. I also thought,\nisn\'t this kind of obvious? Isn\'t this almost like banal, right? If I said to everyone here, none of you are going to lie\non your deathbed and think about all the shoes you bought\nand all the retweets you got, you\'re going to think about moments of love, meaning\nand connection in your life. I think that seems almost like a cliché. But I kept talking\nto professor Kasser and saying, ""Why am I feeling\nthis strange doubleness?"" And he said, ""At some level,\nwe all know these things. But in this culture,\nwe don\'t live by them."" We know them so well\nthey\'ve become clichés, but we don\'t live by them. I kept asking why, why would we know\nsomething so profound, but not live by it? And after a while,\nprofessor Kasser said to me, ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect\nwhat is important about life."" I had to really think about that. ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us\nto neglect what is important about life."" And professor Kasser wanted to figure out\nif we can disrupt that machine. He\'s done loads of research into this; I\'ll tell you about one example, and I really urge everyone here\nto try this with their friends and family. With a guy called Nathan Dungan,\nhe got a group of teenagers and adults to come together for a series of sessions\nover a period of time, to meet up. And part of the point of the group was to get people to think\nabout a moment in their life they had actually found\nmeaning and purpose. For different people,\nit was different things. For some people, it was playing music,\nwriting, helping someone -- I\'m sure everyone here\ncan picture something, right? And part of the point of the group\nwas to get people to ask, ""OK, how could you dedicate\nmore of your life to pursuing these moments\nof meaning and purpose, and less to, I don\'t know,\nbuying crap you don\'t need, putting it on social media\nand trying to get people to go, \'OMG, so jealous!\'"" And what they found was, just having these meetings, it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous\nfor consumerism, right? Getting people to have these meetings,\narticulate these values, determine to act on them\nand check in with each other, led to a marked shift in people\'s values. It took them away from this hurricane\nof depression-generating messages training us to seek happiness\nin the wrong places, and towards more meaningful\nand nourishing values that lift us out of depression. But with all the solutions that I saw\nand have written about, and many I can\'t talk about here, I kept thinking, you know: Why did it take me so long\nto see these insights? Because when you explain them to people -- some of them are more\ncomplicated, but not all -- when you explain this to people,\nit\'s not like rocket science, right? At some level, we already\nknow these things. Why do we find it so hard to understand? I think there\'s many reasons. But I think one reason is\nthat we have to change our understanding of what depression\nand anxiety actually are. There are very real\nbiological contributions to depression and anxiety. But if we allow the biology\nto become the whole picture, as I did for so long, as I would argue our culture\nhas done pretty much most of my life, what we\'re implicitly saying to people\nis, and this isn\'t anyone\'s intention, but what we\'re implicitly\nsaying to people is, ""Your pain doesn\'t mean anything. It\'s just a malfunction. It\'s like a glitch in a computer program, it\'s just a wiring problem in your head."" But I was only able to start\nchanging my life when I realized your depression\nis not a malfunction. It\'s a signal. Your depression is a signal. It\'s telling you something. (Applause) We feel this way for reasons, and they can be hard to see\nin the throes of depression -- I understand that really well\nfrom personal experience. But with the right help,\nwe can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together. But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying they\'re a sign of weakness,\nor madness or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people. We need to start\nlistening to these signals, because they\'re telling us\nsomething we really need to hear. It\'s only when we truly\nlisten to these signals, and we honor these signals\nand respect these signals, that we\'re going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing,\ndeeper solutions. The cows that are waiting all around us. Thank you. (Applause)']"

It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be, back in the \'50s,\na very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger\nand bigger and bigger, and now it\'s 886 pages long. And it lists currently\n374 mental disorders. So I was leafing through it, wondering if I had any mental disorders, and it turns out I\'ve got 12. (Laughter) I\'ve got generalized anxiety disorder, which is a given. I\'ve got nightmare disorder, which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being\npursued or declared a failure, and all my dreams involve people\nchasing me down the street going, ""You\'re a failure!"" (Laughter) I\'ve got parent-child relational problems, which I blame my parents for. (Laughter) I\'m kidding. I\'m not kidding. I\'m kidding. And I\'ve got malingering. And I think it\'s actually quite rare to have both malingering\nand generalized anxiety disorder, because malingering tends\nto make me feel very anxious. Anyway, I was looking through this book, wondering if I was much crazier\nthan I thought I was, or maybe it\'s not a good idea to diagnose\nyourself with a mental disorder if you\'re not a trained professional, or maybe the psychiatry profession\nhas a kind of strange desire to label what\'s essentially normal\nhuman behavior as a mental disorder. I didn\'t know which of these was true,\nbut I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I should\nmeet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up having\nlunch with the Scientologists. (Laughter) It was a man called Brian,\nwho runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy\npsychiatry wherever it lies. They\'re called the CCHR. And I said to him, ""Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo-science\nthat can\'t be trusted?"" And he said, ""Yes,\nwe can prove it to you."" And I said, ""How?"" And he said, ""We\'re going\nto introduce you to Tony."" And I said, ""Who\'s Tony?"" And he said, ""Tony\'s in Broadmoor."" Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor\nAsylum for the Criminally Insane. It\'s where they send the serial killers, and the people who can\'t help themselves. And I said to Brian,\n""Well, what did Tony do?"" And he said, ""Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something, and he decided to fake madness\nto get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well,\nand now he\'s stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe he\'s sane. Do you want us to try and get you\ninto Broadmoor to meet Tony?"" So I said, ""Yes, please."" So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably\naround Kempton Park, which apparently is what dogs\nalso do when anxious, they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate\nafter gate after gate after gate into the wellness center, which is where\nyou get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It\'s all peach and pine\nand calming colors. And the only bold colors\nare the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweight\nand wearing sweatpants, and quite docile-looking. And Brian the Scientologist\nwhispered to me, ""They\'re medicated,"" which, to the Scientologists,\nis like the worst evil in the world, but I\'m thinking\nit\'s probably a good idea. (Laughter) And then Brian said, ""Here\'s Tony."" And a man was walking in. And he wasn\'t overweight,\nhe was in very good physical shape. And he wasn\'t wearing sweatpants, he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice. He looked like a man\nwho wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me\nthat he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said, ""So is it true\nthat you faked your way in here?"" And he said, ""Yep. Yep. Absolutely.\nI beat someone up when I was 17. And I was in prison awaiting trial, and my cellmate said to me, \'You know what you have to do? Fake madness. Tell them you\'re mad, you\'ll get\nsent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas,\nyou\'ll have your own PlayStation.\'"" I said, ""Well, how did you do it?"" He said, ""Well, I asked to see\nthe prison psychiatrist. And I\'d just seen a film called \'Crash,\' in which people get sexual pleasure\nfrom crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \'I get sexual pleasure\nfrom crashing cars into walls.\'"" And I said, ""What else?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah.\nI told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died, because it would make\nme feel more normal."" I said, ""Where\'d you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from a biography\nof Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library."" Anyway, he faked madness\ntoo well, he said. And they didn\'t send him\nto some cushy hospital. They sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there, said he took one look at the place,\nasked to see the psychiatrist, said, ""There\'s been\na terrible misunderstanding. I\'m not mentally ill."" I said, ""How long have you been here for?"" He said, ""Well, if I\'d just\ndone my time in prison for the original crime,\nI\'d have got five years. I\'ve been in Broadmoor for 12 years."" Tony said that it\'s a lot harder\nto convince people you\'re sane than it is to convince them you\'re crazy. He said, ""I thought\nthe best way to seem normal would be to talk to people\nnormally about normal things like football or what\'s on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist, and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was training\nbumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, \'Did you know that the U.S. Army\nis training bumblebees to sniff out explosives?\' When I read my medical notes,\nI saw they\'d written: \'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.\'"" (Laughter) He said, ""You know, they\'re always\nlooking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way? How do you cross your legs in a sane way? It\'s just impossible."" When Tony said that to me, I thought to myself,\n""Am I sitting like a journalist? Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"" He said, ""You know, I\'ve got\nthe Stockwell Strangler on one side of me, and I\'ve got the \'Tiptoe\nThrough the Tulips\' rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lot\nbecause I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. They say it proves\nthat I\'m aloof and grandiose."" So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting\nto hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway, he seemed completely normal\nto me, but what did I know? And when I got home I emailed\nhis clinician, Anthony Maden. I said, ""What\'s the story?"" And he said, ""Yep.\nWe accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence,\nbecause his hallucinations -- that had seemed\nquite cliche to begin with -- just vanished the minute\nhe got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him, and we\'ve determined that what he is is a psychopath."" And in fact, faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning\nand manipulative act of a psychopath. It\'s on the checklist:\ncunning, manipulative. So, faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain\nhas gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts, and they said the pinstripe\nsuit -- classic psychopath -- speaks to items one\nand two on the checklist: glibness, superficial charm\nand grandiose sense of self-worth. And I said, ""Well, but why didn\'t\nhe hang out with the other patients?"" Classic psychopath -- it speaks\nto grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemed\nmost normal about Tony was evidence, according to his clinician, that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me, ""If you\nwant to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopath-spotting course run by Robert Hare, who invented\nthe psychopath checklist."" So I did. I went on a psychopath-spotting course, and I am now a certified -- and I have to say, extremely adept --\npsychopath spotter. So, here\'s the statistics: One in a hundred regular people\nis a psychopath. So there\'s 1,500 people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percent\nof CEOs and business leaders, so I think there\'s a very good chance there\'s about 30 or 40\npsychopaths in this room. It could be carnage\nby the end of the night. (Laughter) Hare said the reason why\nis because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative. In fact, capitalism, perhaps\nat its most remorseless, is a physical manifestation\nof psychopathy. It\'s like a form of psychopathy\nthat\'s come down to affect us all. Hare said, ""You know what?\nForget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares? That\'s not a big story. The big story,"" he said,\n""is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourself\nsome corporate psychopaths."" So I gave it a try.\nI wrote to the Enron people. I said, ""Could I come\nand interview you in prison, to find out it you\'re psychopaths?"" (Laughter) And they didn\'t reply. (Laughter) So I changed tack. I emailed ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent\nof the workforce, just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said, ""I believe you may have\na very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special, and interested in the predatory\nspirit, and fearless. Can I come and interview you\nabout your special brain anomaly?"" And he said, ""Come on over!"" (Laughter) So I went to Al Dunlap\'s\ngrand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures\nof predatory animals. There were lions and tigers --\nhe was taking me through the garden -- there were falcons and eagles, he was saying, ""Over there\nyou\'ve got sharks and --"" he was saying this\nin a less effeminate way -- ""You\'ve got more sharks\nand you\'ve got tigers."" It was like Narnia. (Laughter) And then we went into his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in\nto save failing companies, he\'d close down 30 percent\nof the workforce. And he\'d quite often\nfire people with a joke. Like, for instance,\none famous story about him, somebody came up to him and said,\n""I\'ve just bought myself a new car."" And he said, ""Well,\nyou may have a new car, but I\'ll tell you what you\ndon\'t have -- a job."" So in his kitchen -- he was in there with his wife, Judy,\nand his bodyguard, Sean -- and I said, ""You know\nhow I said in my email that you might have a special brain\nanomaly that makes you special?"" He said, ""Yeah, it\'s an amazing\ntheory, it\'s like Star Trek. You\'re going where\nno man has gone before."" And I said, ""Well --"" (Clears throat) (Laughter) Some psychologists might say that this makes you --""\n(Mumbles) (Laughter) And he said, ""What?"" And I said, ""A psychopath."" And I said, ""I\'ve got a list\nof psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you?"" And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, ""Okay, go on."" And I said, ""Okay.\nGrandiose sense of self-worth."" Which I have to say, would\nhave been hard for him to deny, because he was standing\nunder a giant oil painting of himself. (Laughter) He said, ""Well, you\'ve\ngot to believe in you!"" And I said, ""Manipulative."" He said, ""That\'s leadership."" (Laughter) And I said, ""Shallow affect, an inability to experience\na range of emotions."" He said, ""Who wants to be weighed\ndown by some nonsense emotions?"" So he was going down\nthe psychopath checklist, basically turning it\ninto ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" (Laughter) But I did notice something happening\nto me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to me\nthat was kind of normal -- like he said ""no"" to juvenile delinquency, he said he got accepted into West Point, and they don\'t let\ndelinquents in West Point. He said ""no"" to many short-term\nmarital relationships. He\'s only ever been married twice. Admittedly, his first wife\ncited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered\nwhat human flesh tasted like, but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages\nin the heat of an argument, and his second marriage\nhas lasted 41 years. So whenever he said anything to me\nthat just seemed kind of non-psychopathic, I thought to myself, well I\'m not\ngoing to put that in my book. And then I realized that\nbecoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me\na little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him\nin a box marked ""Psychopath."" I was desperate to define him\nby his maddest edges. And I realized, my God -- this is what I\'ve been doing for 20 years. It\'s what all journalists do. We travel across the world\nwith our notepads in our hands, and we wait for the gems. And the gems are always\nthe outermost aspects of our interviewee\'s personality. And we stitch them together\nlike medieval monks, and we leave the normal\nstuff on the floor. And you know, this is a country\nthat over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar -- children as young as four\nare being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them high\non the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London, Tony phoned me. He said, ""Why haven\'t you\nbeen returning my calls?"" I said, ""Well, they say\nthat you\'re a psychopath."" And he said, ""I\'m not a psychopath."" He said, ""You know what? One of the items on the checklist\nis lack of remorse, but another item on the checklist\nis cunning, manipulative. So when you say you feel\nremorse for your crime, they say, \'Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels\nremorse when he doesn\'t.\' It\'s like witchcraft, they turn\neverything upside-down."" He said, ""I\'ve got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it?"" So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after 14 years\nin Broadmoor, they let him go. They decided that he shouldn\'t\nbe held indefinitely because he scores high\non a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater\nthan average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me, ""You know what, Jon? Everyone\'s a bit psychopathic."" He said, ""You are, I am.\nWell, obviously I am."" I said, ""What are you going to do now?"" He said, ""I\'m going to go to Belgium. There\'s a woman there that I fancy. But she\'s married, so I\'m going to have\nto get her split up from her husband."" (Laughter) Anyway, that was two years ago, and that\'s where my book ended. And for the last 20 months,\neverything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was, according\nto Brian the Scientologist, making up for lost time,\nwhich I know sounds ominous, but isn\'t necessarily ominous. Unfortunately, after 20 months, he did go back to jail for a month. He got into a ""fracas""\nin a bar, he called it. Ended up going to jail for a month,\nwhich I know is bad, but at least a month implies\nthat whatever the fracas was, it wasn\'t too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what, I think\nit\'s right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn\'t define\npeople by their maddest edges. And what Tony is,\nis he\'s a semi-psychopath. He\'s a gray area in a world\nthat doesn\'t like gray areas. But the gray areas\nare where you find the complexity. It\'s where you find the humanity, and it\'s where you find the truth. And Tony said to me, ""Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank you\nfor everything you\'ve done for me."" And I didn\'t go. What would you have done? Thank you. (Applause)']"

They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature\nleaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations\nwith difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path\nby accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power\nwhatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees\nto believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point\nyou got lied to, it\'s because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:\nLying\'s a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we\'re willing\nparticipants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should\nbe kept secret, secret. We say, ""Nice song."" ""Honey, you don\'t look fat in that, no."" Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, ""You know, I just fished\nthat email out of my Spam folder. So sorry."" But there are times when we are unwilling\nparticipants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone\nin the United States. That\'s an eyelash\nunder a trillion dollars. That\'s seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case\nof double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,\nthey can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths\nof those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,\nhe was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire\nbanking system of the Western world. And you can\'t find this guy on Google;\nyou can\'t find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,\nand he said the following. He said, ""Look, I\'ve got one rule."" And this was Henry\'s rule, he said, ""Look, everyone is willing\nto give you something. They\'re ready to give you something\nfor whatever it is they\'re hungry for."" And that\'s the crux of it. If you don\'t want to be\ndeceived, you have to know, what is it that you\'re hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were\nbetter husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,\nhow we wish we could be, with what we\'re really like. And boy are we willing to fill in\nthose gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show\nthat you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes\nof meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear\nthis data, we recoil. We can\'t believe how prevalent lying is. We\'re essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,\nthe plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers\nthan we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves\nthan they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you\'re an average married couple, you\'re going to lie to your spouse\nin one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that\'s bad. If you\'re unmarried,\nthat number drops to three. Lying\'s complex. It\'s woven into the fabric\nof our daily and our business lives. We\'re deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because\nwe don\'t understand the gaps in our lives. That\'s truth number two about lying. We\'re against lying, but we\'re covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned\nfor centuries and centuries and centuries. It\'s as old as breathing. It\'s part of our culture,\nit\'s part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,\nthe Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value\nto us as a species. Researchers have long known\nthat the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla\nwho was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate\nvia sign language. Here\'s Koko with her kitten. It\'s her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten\nfor ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We\'re hardwired to become\nleaders of the pack. It\'s starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who\'s coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you\'re going to lie to your mom\nin one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world\nand we\'re breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered\nwith Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls\na post-truth society. It\'s been very confusing\nfor a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take\nto navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth\n90 percent of the time. The rest of us,\nwe\'re only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.\nWe all use the same techniques. So what I\'m going to do is I\'m going\nto show you two patterns of deception. And then we\'re going\nto look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We\'re going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:\nI want you to listen to me. I\'m going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations\nwith that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,\nnot a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work\nfor the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,\nwhat were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what\'s known\nas a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people\nwho are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather\nthan informal language. We also heard\ndistancing language: ""that woman."" We know that liars will unconsciously\ndistance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,\n""Well, to tell you the truth ..."" or Richard Nixon\'s favorite,\n""In all candor ..."" he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it\'s called,\nqualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated\nthe question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account\nwith a little too much detail -- and we\'re all really glad\nhe didn\'t do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,\nthere\'s much more to it than speech: ""No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,\nhe chatters with his fingertips."" And we all do it no matter\nhow powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I\'m going to show you\nDominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who\'s chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,\nwhich is body language. With body language,\nhere\'s what you\'ve got to do. You\'ve really got to just throw\nyour assumptions out the door. Let the science temper\nyour knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars\nfidget all the time. Well guess what, they\'re known to freeze\ntheir upper bodies when they\'re lying. We think liars won\'t look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look\nyou in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles\nconvey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter\ncan spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract\nthe muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile\'s in the eyes,\nthe crow\'s feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don\'t overdo the Botox;\nnobody will think you\'re honest. Now we\'re going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what\'s happening\nin a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone\'s words\nand someone\'s actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you\'re having a conversation\nwith someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked\nbut telling of indicators. An honest person\nis going to be cooperative. They\'re going to show\nthey\'re on your side. They\'re going to be enthusiastic. They\'re going to be willing and helpful\nto getting you to the truth. They\'re going to be willing\nto brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They\'re going to say, ""Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll\nthat forged those checks."" They\'re going to be infuriated\nif they sense they\'re wrongly accused throughout the entire course\nof the interview, not just in flashes; they\'ll be infuriated throughout\nthe entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen\nto whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather\nthan lenient punishment. Now let\'s say you\'re having\nthat exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person\nto tell their story, they\'re going to pepper it\nwith way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they\'re going to tell their story\nin strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways\nover the course of several hours, they will ask that person\nto tell that story backwards, and then they\'ll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce\nthe highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?\nWell, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say ""yes,"" we shake our heads ""no."" We tell very convincing stories,\nwe slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight\nin getting away with it. Now, that smile is known\nin the trade as ""duping delight."" And we\'re going to see that\nin several videos moving forward, but we\'re going to start --\nfor those of you who don\'t know him, this is presidential\ncandidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering\na child out of wedlock. We\'re going to see him talk\nabout getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him\nsaying, ""yes"" while shaking his head ""no,"" slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I\'d be happy\nto participate in one. I know that it\'s not possible\nthat this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it\'s not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,\nand would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do\nthat soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I\'m only one side.\nI\'m only one side of the test. But I\'m happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes\nare much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times\nwhen someone makes one expression while masking another that just\nkind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner\nmight shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you\nand then leak an expression of anger. And we\'re not all going to become\nfacial expression experts overnight here, but there\'s one I can teach you\nthat\'s very dangerous and it\'s easy to learn, and that\'s the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you\'ve got\ntwo people on an even playing field. It\'s still somewhat\nof a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,\nyou\'ve been dismissed. It\'s associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it\'s very,\nvery hard to recover from. Here\'s what it looks like. It\'s marked by one lip corner\npulled up and in. It\'s the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,\nwhether or not deception follows -- and it doesn\'t always follow -- look the other way,\ngo the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, ""No thank you. I\'m not coming up\nfor just one more nightcap. Thank you."" Science has surfaced\nmany, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves\nand the person that is interviewing them. They\'ll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here\'s the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They\'re not proof of deception. They\'re red flags. We\'re human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures\nall over the place all day long. They don\'t mean anything\nin and of themselves. But when you see clusters\nof them, that\'s your signal. Look, listen, probe,\nask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable\nmode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,\nask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person\nyou\'re talking to with rapport. Don\'t try to be like those folks\non ""Law & Order"" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects\ninto submission. Don\'t be too aggressive, it doesn\'t work. Now, we\'ve talked a little bit\nabout how to talk to someone who\'s lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we\'re now going\nto look at what the truth looks like. But I\'m going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,\none is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher\nDavid Matsumoto in California. And I think they\'re an excellent example\nof what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital\nwhile they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you\'ll see when you see the video, she can\'t even pretend\nto be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here\nis an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes\nand her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you\'ll see\nduping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:\nAt night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching\nher hand out to me while I\'m driving, and the blood just kept\ncoming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe\nit\'ll fade too with time -- but I don\'t think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I\'m going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,\nErin Runnion, confronting her daughter\'s murderer\nand torturer in court. Here you\'re going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression\nof a mother\'s agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:\nI wrote this statement on the third anniversary\nof the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you\nwith those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don\'t understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there\'s no doubting\nthe veracity of those emotions. Now the technology\naround what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers\nand infrared brain scans, MRI\'s that can decode the signals\nthat our bodies send out when we\'re trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going\nto be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove\nincredibly useful some day. But you\'ve got to ask yourself\nin the meantime: Who do you want on your side\nof the meeting, someone who\'s trained\nin getting to the truth or some guy who\'s going to drag\na 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, ""Character\'s who you are in the dark."" And what\'s kind of interesting\nis that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It\'s transparent\nwith blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz\nof a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live\ntheir lives in public. It\'s a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that\'s not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting\ncan blind us to the fact that the subtleties\nof human decency -- character integrity -- that\'s still what matters,\nthat\'s always what\'s going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit\nabout our moral code. When you combine the science\nof recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself\nfrom collaborating in a lie. You start up that path\nof being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, ""Hey, my world, our world,\nit\'s going to be an honest one. My world is going to be\none where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized\nand marginalized."" And when you do that, the ground around you starts\nto shift just a little bit. And that\'s the truth. Thank you. (Applause)']"
32,0,How breathing and metabolism are interconnected | Ruben Meerman | TEDxBundaberg,Ruben shares his knowledge on how to breathe yourself thin by explaining where fat goes when you lose weight.  Ruben is better known to Aussie kids as the Surfing Scientist. He performed experiments on ABC television programs for more than a decade and was the first ever resident scientist on Play School. Ruben's research was published in the British Medical Journal and he is the Author of Big Fat Myths. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx,TEDx Talks,nM-ySWyID9o,"['Transcriber: Yoshie Asahara\nReviewer: Tanya Cushman About seven years ago, I saw this photo of myself and decided that I had to do something about this thing. So I ate less food,\nmoved around a bit more, and lo and behold, this happened. I lost 16 kilograms. And you\'re probably wondering, How did he do it? But I was wondering, Where did the 16 kilograms go? And I\'ve been infatuated\nwith this question ever since. I ended up publishing a paper about it\nin the British Medical Journal, very brief paper - 850 words, two figures. And then, I published a book about it,\nwhich was no bestseller because it told you that you had to eat less\nand move more to lose weight. No one wants to hear that. But it\'s now a first-year subject\nat the University of New South Wales, and so I better explain that I did not figure out\nwhere fat goes when you lose weight. That was done a long time ago. In fact, here\'s some time posts for you. When Captain Cook sailed\npast Bundaberg in 1770, we didn\'t know what happens to fat\nwhen you lose weight. But when the First Fleet\nsailed into Sydney Cove, we did know the answer, and it was all figured out\nby this bloke in between. His name\'s Antoine Lavoisier. He figured out that respiration\nis a combustion. You turn food into\ncarbon dioxide and water. And in the process, nothing is lost. Nothing is created. Everything is just transformed. And so, what did I do? Well, when I lost weight and I first\nthought about this, I was so infatuated. I wanted to know if I lose 10 kilos, where\ndoes the 10 kilos go precisely? And it took me months to figure this out. But it turns out that\nwhen you lose weight, 8.4 kilos out of every 10\ncomes out of your lungs, which I think is the best fact\nI\'ve ever heard, so I gave - you\'ve got to add oxygen to do this,\nso you can\'t do it (snap) like that. It takes a while. So I gave a talk about this at TEDxQUT\na long time ago now, and then I did a story\nfor ABC TV Catalyst, and I met this fellow, \nProfessor Andrew Brown, who teaches biochemistry. And I showed him my calculations, and he said, ""That\'s pretty interesting. Let\'s try and get that published."" And so he helped me get it\ninto the British Medical Journal. And the other thing we did was we surveyed 150 doctors,\ndieticians and personal trainers and asked them what they thought. And here\'s the thing: what they think happens is impossible. You can\'t turn fat into energy,\nbecause it\'s made of atoms. And you would need antimatter atoms\nto annihilate them. So that\'s literally impossible. And since then,\nI\'ve realised, well, hang on, this is part of a much bigger gap\nin health literacy. I\'ve asked literally thousands\nof kids this question: When you breathe in,\nwhat are you inhaling? Oxygen. And what are you exhaling? Carbon dioxide. What they don\'t realise\nis that they\'re breathing in atoms, and two go in, but three come out. And it\'s this atom here\nthat is the gap in health literacy. It\'s also the secret to weight loss because it means that your exhaled breath\nis heavier than your inhaled breath. And when you ask around,\nso few people know this. Well, have a listen to these people: (Audio) Ruben Meerman: What\'s\nthe gas that you inhale in out of the air that keeps you alive called? Oxygen. Oxygen. RM: And what\'s the gas you breathe out\nbecause you\'re alive? Carbon dioxide? Carbon dioxide? RM: Now third question. Where did the carbon atoms\nin the carbon dioxide come from? Oh ... I don\'t know. (Chuckle) No idea. I\'ve got no idea. I wouldn\'t have a clue, mate. Ooh, ahhhh. Ummmm, wow! Good question. I should have concentrated\nmore in chemistry. So where do carbon atoms come from? Or ... Umm, pollution? Fumes? Gas? Cars and stuff? I don\'t know. Yeah. Vehicles. Don\'t know. Cow poop? (Laughter) Should know, but don\'t know. So to be somewhere in the body, right? Out of my lungs. My lungs? From the environment? From your blood stream? From living things? Maybe from the blood? From plants? My chemistry days are over.\nI\'ve got nothing. From the food we eat? RM: You know that! You got there! Really? So you eat it. RM: Yeah We eat it? From what? RM: Have you heard of carbohydrates? Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, OK. RM: What do you think\nthe carbo bit means? Carbon dioxide. Probably carbon dioxide?\nDoes it connect to somewhere? Like carbon and hydrogen\nand oxygen together? RM: Yes! Carbon - carbohydrate, yeah. It\'s not the same word. Never thought. It\'s C-H-A.\nCarbon-hydrogen. OK, interesting. RM: What do you do for a crust? I\'m a PDH PE teacher. (Onstage) This is not a gap\nin health literacy. This is a gaping black hole\nin health literacy. And the amazing thing is we supposedly\nlearned all this stuff at school. We learned all the dots, but no one ever\nteaches you how to connect them. So the word carbohydrates is the big clue, and that\'s because it stands\nfor carbon atoms that have been hydrated by - well, if you\'re dehydrated,\nyou need to drink water. And water has a chemical formula,\nwhich stands for a bunch of atoms. So where do these carbohydrates\nthat you eat come from? I mean what is this stuff? And it all starts in plants. So Step 1 in making carbohydrates\nis plants suck water out of the soil. They take the water molecules, stick it into a molecule\ncalled chlorophyll, you\'ve all heard of. It takes a photon of sunlight\nto zap that bond and zap that bond, and now we have the atoms free. You do that twice, and you\'ve got enough atoms now\nto make an oxygen molecule, which is the waste product\nof photosynthesis. And by the way, you breathe that stuff. So every oxygen molecule you inhale\ncame from two water molecules. Step 2 is to take carbon dioxide\nout of the air into the leaf, and into a chemical process,\nwhich is called the Calvin Cycle. And if you get six carbon atoms\nand stick them together, you can make glucose, which is the most important\ncarbohydrate in the cosmos. If you rearrange those atoms,\nthen you can make fructose, which is what sugarcane does, which I have a stalk of over there, and if you stick it in sunlight, it will turn carbon dioxide\nand water into sugar. If you stick glucose to fructose, you get table sugar, and if you stick galactose to glucose, you get another famous disaccharide. It\'s called lactose. If you\'re lactose intolerant, you can\'t break the bonds between\nthis oxygen atom and its neighbours. So all of this stuff is understandable\nif you know about atoms, and it all starts in plants. But you don\'t just eat carbohydrates. So here\'s everything that you eat, all the macronutrients. We\'ve looked at carbs. Here\'s fats. The three most common\nfatty acids in nature? palmitic acid gets its name from palm oil, oleic from olive oil. There\'s only three atoms there though. Three kinds. Three elements. And if you stick those three fatty acids\nto a glycerin molecule, you\'ll make a triglyceride. This is what olive oil is; this is what every fat in nature is. It\'s the fat in your fat cells\nthat you want to lose if you\'re trying to lose weight. And when you burn it, what you\'re really doing is turning it\ninto carbon dioxide and water. You call it metabolism. People say they\'re burning fat. It means you\'re turning it\ninto carbon dioxide and water. And there\'s two ways to do it. The main highway is called\nthe beta oxidation pathway, but there\'s another way\ncalled the ketogenic pathway, and the low-carb people\nwill be all over this. It\'s taking fatty acids and turning them\ninto smaller molecules - acetyl acetate - which can then\nbe turned into acetone, and beta hydroxybutarate. But the point is you still add oxygen and it still turns\ninto carbon dioxide and water, so it doesn\'t matter\nwhat kind of diet you\'re on. If you\'re burning fat,\nyou\'re turning it into CO2 and H2O. And alcohol\'s made\nof the same three atoms. Protein\'s an interesting one. It\'s made out of 20 kinds of amino acids, but there\'s only two more kinds of atoms. So for all their complexity,\nthere\'s only five elements. And if you eat them -\nwell, let\'s take a look. Because to make a human,\nyou need those 20 amino acids. All the protein in nature\nis made out of these 20 amino acids. A baby, a human, is 60% water, 16% protein, 19% fat\nand 5% a bit of other stuff. And when you burn protein, if you eat a lot of it,\nyou can\'t store it. So you\'ll burn it, and you\'ll turn it\ninto carbon dioxide and water, a bit of urea and some sulfate. Those two things will end up\nin the toilet via your bladder, and now you know\nwhere everything that you eat goes. You might be wondering, though, ""I\'m eating carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. What\'s all this talk about diets?"" Amazingly, this junk diet is also made\nof nothing but carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, but you\'re not getting\nmany vitamins and minerals. So let\'s take a look at those. Here\'s all 14 vitamins\nthat you need to eat. If you don\'t eat them, you\'ll get scurvy,\nberiberi rickets - you\'ll go blind. But the amazing thing is per day, you only need\nabout half a gram of this stuff. The 14 elements that you have to take,\nwe call them minerals. Here they are. These are the recommended daily intakes, and if you stick all that together,\nit\'s seven grams worth of stuff. It\'s not very much. That\'s why we call them micronutrients. So when I tell people this, the first question I get asked is\n""So what? I just have to breathe more?"" And they\'ll start hyperventilating. (Laughter) So let\'s talk about breathing. Talk to anyone who works in an ICU unit, and they\'ll tell you that a human\nwho\'s lying perfectly still needs 3.5 millilitres of oxygen, and 2.6 to 2.9 millilitres of CO2\nwill come out of them per kilogram of that person. Now, I weigh 72 kilos, so that means I need about\n252 millilitres of oxygen just to stay alive. That\'s 15 litres per hour, and over here,\nI have an hour\'s worth of breathing. This is how much air I have to breathe just to get that one balloon of oxygen\ninto my bloodstream. A balloon is about 15 litres. So that\'s how much oxygen I need per hour\njust to stay awake and alive - not awake, sorry - I mean alive. It\'s my resting metabolic rate. And in that hour, when I breathe\nall this air back out again, it\'ll have a balloon worth of CO2 in it, and these numbers just get better\nand better and better. If you add up all the carbon\natoms in that much CO2, it\'s 136 to 151 grams a day\nof just carbon. It\'s about a kilo a week. It\'s about 49 to 55 kilos a year. If you want to lose weight,\ndon\'t eat that much carbon back in. That\'s the whole key\nto breathing yourself thin. Doctors will - if you are not breathing,\nthey will monitor your breathing. If you\'re having an operation, the anaesthetist\nwill look for your breaths. This is how much CO2\nthere should be in your breath. If you hyperventilate,\nyour body is not producing more CO2. You\'re just breathing out\nmore than you need to, and so this will happen. You\'re pumping out\nmore than you\'re making; the amount in your body will go down. It\'s called hypocapnia. It will lead to a loss of consciousness\nif you do it for too long. And some people ask me: ""What about people\nwho have COPD or emphysema? Could they get overweight\nbecause they can\'t get rid of enough CO2?"" Well, they can\'t do the Calvin Cycle - a plant can - so you can\'t turn the CO2\nthat you\'re not breathing out back into fat. It\'s impossible. So, you know, there\'s a lot\nof misconceptions about this business. Now, it takes a while to breathe out\nthe carbon that you eat. So let\'s have a look at how much carbon\nyou can put in really quickly. I quite like this stuff, and there is a lot of sugar\nin lemon-flavoured soft drink. It\'s one of the highest. So, how much sugar are we talking about? Well, one stick is 3 grams, so there\'s 23\nand a third of a stick in there, which looks like this. And if you want to turn that much sugar\ninto carbon dioxide and water, well, it\'s going to take a while. You\'re going to need to breathe in\nthat much oxygen. You\'ll make that much CO2. How much is that?\nIt\'s four balloons worth. And it\'s four balloons\' worth of CO2. So, how long is it going to take me\nto breathe out that much carbon? It\'s going to take me four hours because I only breathe out one balloon\nof carbon dioxide per hour if I stay still, but if I go for a walk,\nI\'ll breathe it out in an hour. If I run, it\'ll only take me 30 minutes. That\'s why they say eat less, move more. Because when you\'re moving more,\nyou\'re breathing more. And there\'s always CO2 in your breath. What about if we compare it\nto something a bit healthier? Because this has got vitamins\nand amino acids and all the good stuff in it. But if we take those ingredients, and we chuck it \ninto the equation for food, then you discover that, actually,\nit\'s four hours as well. And so is this tuna salad sandwich\non organic wholemeal bread, grown on the north side of the hill,\nblessed by a monk, all the things. (Laughter) But it\'s still four hours \nof breathing, right? So the point is they\'re not equivalent\nin how healthy they are, but they are equivalent\nin how long they take to exhale. An apple takes an hour; a fun size chocolate bar,\nan hour, 10 minutes; regular size, 3.5 hours;\nand a king-sized, 5.25. If you\'re trying to lose weight,\ndon\'t drink soft drink, because that\'s got carbon atoms in it. Drink water. If you like this stuff -\nand who doesn\'t? - a large coffee and a piece of cake. That\'s 10 hours of breathing between breakfast and lunch. So be careful. A large, lovely burger\nlike this guy - 7 hours. Have a large fries with it, 13 hours; large drink, 16 hours; bang in a large sundae -\nit\'s a whole day worth of breathing. You can see why\nthere\'s an obesity epidemic, but no one knows what really\nis going on in their body. So, usually, we talk about\ncalories in, calories out. How\'s this information going to help you? Well, I would like to talk about\natoms in, atoms out. And when you\'re counting calories,\nyou\'re actually counting carbon atoms because the energy in food is wherever you see a carbon\nand a hydrogen atom stuck together. And it\'s in all food. So just - and it\'s sunlight\nthat put that there. So my project that I really want to get up\nand running here at Bundaberg is let\'s teach your children this, and you can do it. Little kids love learning about atoms. Adults freak out at the idea. But little kids absolutely love it. This is Ithaca Creek\nState School in Brisbane. This is a school in India, and these kids are using amino,\nand they\'re making amino acids and sticking them together\nto build a protein. You can do that with amazing resource\nthat my friend Ian Stewart invented. They\'re called ""sticky atoms"". He\'s a retired physics\nand chemistry teacher. He taught in Brisbane. They have magnetic bonds\nso three-year-olds, even younger, can play with these things\nand learn about atoms. And for the educators in the room, they conform to the concrete\npictorial abstract way of teaching. It\'s a fantastic pedagogy, and Ian and I are hoping to work together. We took this out backstage,\njust moments ago. Because what we want to do\nis teach children what\'s actually going on in their bodies. And you can\'t do that if you\'re not talking about\nthe atoms that they\'re made of. Unfortunately, the curriculum does not introduce\nthe concept of atoms and molecules until kids are in Grade 9, and they don\'t see the periodic table\nuntil they\'re in Grade 10. Why? Because a fellow called Jean Piaget,\nwho was kind of a contemporary of Freud. He thought that kids\ncan\'t have these abstract thoughts until they\'re about 14. We don\'t use Freud\'s psychology anymore. We still learn it, but we don\'t use it. But our curriculum is still under the spell\nof a person who died long ago, whose ideas about education were, well,\nsomeone had to have those ideas, but they were wrong. So I hope to see what happens\nif kids grow up with this knowledge. In 10 years, what do obesity rates\nlook like in a town like Bundaberg if all the children learn this\nat primary school? Will they grow up to accept the advice that to lose weight, just eat less,\nmove more and keep breathing? Thank you. (Applause)']"

well I might get myself into a position here and on the red carpet I don't think I need to introduce myself do I but this is the last talk for the day we will have a little bit of wrap up after this and we will have a little time to to reflect and maybe some questions I know some of you will want to get home but let's get cracking because we've got about well probably 12 minutes is my talk maybe might go for 15 so don't panic if that thing goes over so here we go the mathematics of weight loss well let me start with this last year I went surfing in Fiji and the resort had a photographer following us around taking all these photos which was really great except that I couldn't help but notice this somehow I'd managed to become 5 kilograms overweight couldn't believe my eyes so I did what they tell you to do I ate less and I moved more and within just three months I discovered I'd lost 6 kilograms so then I did what a normal person does I did physics but anyone would do this I graphed my weight and when I did the linear regression I discovered that lo and behold on average I'd been losing 85 grams a day which got me thinking in fact it got me very curious about this question that I've since discovered most people have no clue about in fact they've never even thought about this and to prove my point I've made a little video on Bondi Beach and the question was this when somebody loses weight where does it go what does it become how does it get out of your body you're probably dumbstruck by the question these people were so listen to this where does it go where does the weight go well well I don't know I don't know that I don't know the mysteries of science it gets used up the universe another dimension doesn't go anywhere it comes over to me becomes nothing don't exist anymore I guess that's a very good question question what it fascinating question what would you say it goes right in the crapper mate sweat moisture and sweat evaporates up a Bondi Beach that's where I go well basically you burn it up as energy darkness is energy heat energy burnt in energy yeah you got me there I'm not quite sure mmm so what the heck is going on we're in the middle of an obesity epidemic I don't need to tell you about it so why don't these people know the answer to this fundamental question because not one of them was right and we do know the answer this is not groundbreaking stuff I'm about to tell you so let me just remind you of a few things you do know what's the chemical formula for water h2o chemical formula for carbon dioxide you all know it right so you know what human fat is made of so what is the chemical formula for human fat there is such a thing believe it or not it's been known since the 60s it's C 55 H 104 oh six that's the chemical formula for the average fat molecule in a human body some of the molecules might have a few more carbon atoms and a few more hydrogen some might have less they all have just six oxygen atoms that's very important and helpful for later but this is the average fat molecule hate c55 hate 104 oh six so let's be very clear about this the difference between that and that is C 55 H 1 Oh 406 I kid you not the difference between that and that same thing c55 h1 Oh 406 so how does this stuff get out of a human body well here's the general equation looks pretty sort of interesting slightly complicated not if you've done some year 10 chemistry surely this is year 10 chemistry although well it's not really but here's what it says fat plus oxygen gives you carbon dioxide and water that's what it becomes and this biochemist have known this for ages you inhale that you exhale that that's what happens to it amazing now that little arrow there is kind of oversimplifying something called biochemistry that's three years at university and my apologies to the biochemist so that men doubt oversimplify but I'm trying to get to the crunch it's really complicated it doesn't just come out of you for no reason you've got to do stuff eat less move more what we'll come to that in a minute but look when you want to lose weight you want to lose kilograms that's all kilograms all that stuff there so what do people say heat it burns up as energy because that's what we've been telling them all this time and it's very confusing because energy has different units kilojoules or you might use calories and yes that's heat that's motion when you move or it's thinking your brain needs energy or it's growing but that's not where the fat goes so what are we talking about here well let me just show you a couple more things so I've got some carbon dioxide here in its frozen form we call it dry ice it's carbon dioxide it has mass thing is you're not used to seeing it but here's some dry ice and it's heavy and if you put it in water lo and behold it does this cool thing in bubbles like you've all seen that before well that's carbon dioxide in water that's what fat is kind of made out of but it's not fat I'm not making fat that is not fat so how does that become fat well it doesn't just like that it becomes sugar first plants make fat well they start the whole thing a plant takes six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water uses an amazing chemical called chlorophyll holds them together and then sunlight comes in and finds those molecules together and it becomes sugar c6h12o6 is glucose fructose same formula c6h12o6 sucrose is glucose plus fructose stuck together - and h2o molecule so it's do the maths c20 no 12h 2205 right well here some this is sucrose plants make it and it's this stuff joined together it's now got chemical energy holding these molecules together so they don't just fly around like that and by the way if you drink that 600 mil of lemon flavored soft drink you'll get 17 teaspoons of this stuff are in there I'll just quickly show what that looks like here's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 right so if you drink that it's the equivalent of doing what I just did with the spoon except munching it all down exactly the same no difference so if you do do that then what happens well let me explain something else that I've been telling kids for a little while and they get this so when you eat food it's not in your body straight away if you swallow that sugar it's not in you yet so here's a pool noodle right it's got a hole running through it and here's an almond and if we put the almond in there can go all the way through and out the other end whoop-dee-doo here's another almond if I put an almond in here is where's the almond you would say the almonds in the pool noodle okay but is it in the foam that the pool noodle is made of no of course not it's just in the hole that runs through it that's food you swallow food it's not in you it's in the hole that runs from here to the back door and getting food into you it's called digestion so with this stuff you've got to break the bond that's holding the fructose to the glucose and as soon as you do that then that stuff can cross the barrier or internal skin and into your body and then it can go around in your blood that's digestion but now it's not metabolism yet it's got to go into your cells and then you've got to burn it up and if you don't burn it up if you eat all that sugar after you've had your three meals in the day your body doesn't waste it doesn't come out here the stuff that comes out the back door was never in you apart from a few molecules of cholesterol it's just fiber that you couldn't digest plus the bacteria that live in your gut you lose about 500 billion of those in one single sitting they're tiny that's many times the population of the earth every time you flush the toilet it's amazing but that stuff was never really in you so here's what happens if you don't then metabolize that sugar well then it's going to get converted into the stuff that we all have a problem with fat now better just prove that you do breathe breathe this stuff out right if you metabolize sugar you turn it back into carbon dioxide and water so every time you exhale out comes a bit of carbon dioxide you can't see it this is the problem this is why people don't know how you lose weight so there you go of traps and breath I've inhaled that 5% of the air in there is now carbon dioxide because it's come out of my lungs I've got some liquid nitrogen here and I'm going to use that to freeze this air liquid nitrogen is minus 196 very handy um where did I write that in fact I'll just pour it straight on so be a little bit careful with this stuff I use it all the time if I look a little blase I don't mean to it's please respect this stuff if you play with it the way you would respect boiling hot water now if you pour it onto a balloon the balloon does not pop which is incredible the nitrogen is minus 196 oxygen turns into a liquid at minus 183 so the oxygen in the balloon is turning into liquid carbon dioxide turns solid I've got a big bowl of it there but it turns solid at minus 78 so in the balloon now I have frozen well I have liquefied oxygen and frozen carbon dioxide I'm gonna take it out you'll see them so I'll just take a while for the balloon to go a little bit clear at the top the nitrogen in here air is 79% nitrogen the nitrogen is in the top of the balloon but now look at that liquid down there can you see that that's the oxygen from my breath that I hadn't used but once it's all gone there'll be some white powder left right the white powder is breakfast that's the carbon dioxide the carbon atoms I ate in the last 24 hours and when I blow on them they get warm enough to turn back into gas and they vanish and people think there's nothing in the balloon the balloon has mass those atoms have mass you can see carbon dioxide has mass when you solidified but when you breathe it out you don't see it and we've been confusing people by talking about kilojoules or calories and they're really important but people do not seem to understand that when you lose weight you're losing atoms you can't just turn atoms into nothing in fact science teachers out there you need to change the way you teach chemistry because those people and many in this room think that you can turn atoms into energy well it's one of the founding principles of modern chemistry you cannot turn an atom into pure energy it's called the conservation of mass before a reaction and after a reaction we teach kids you've got to have the same number of atoms it's called stoichiometry well we haven't been teaching it very well at all because people think you can turn fat which is kilograms into nothing or just kilojoules can't do it so he was my big fat question I'm a physicist I knew that bit but my question was if I've got 10 kilograms of this stuff then how much carbon dioxide does that become and how much water and turns out that that's really simple - this is year 10 chemistry and year 10 maths you need the periodic table of elements you have to look up hydrogen carbon and oxygen there they are now the periodic table has some important information on it the weight of a single atom of these elements so the weight of a single atom of carbon is twelve point zero zero one zero one one atomic mass units doesn't matter what they are in kilograms just yet I'll show you why in a minute we've got 55 of those in a average fat molecule so there's six hundred sixty point five nine what about the hydrogen okay there's a hundred and four of those so we have in one molecule of fat 104 point eight three atomic mass units okay great the oxygen is a little trickier this stumped me for quite some time in fact I rang around and I couldn't get a very clear answer on this because it doesn't seem that many biochemists have thought about it this way that's not because they're silly or whatever they just haven't thought about it in this way which really surprised me because this bit of information is the most motivating bit of information I had in my personal little journey of losing seventeen kilograms in six months it's all gone breathe it out amazing you could anyone can do this it's not hard so how much carbon dioxide and water well the oxygen is important there's six atoms of it in a molecule but what are they going to become are they gonna go out as carbon dioxide are they gonna go as water are they going some ratio of the two how do you figure this out took me ages and then the answer turned up in a very old paper from the 1940s where they'd taken water labelled the oxygen atoms made them put some an isotope of oxygen on to those and oxygen 18 gave it to mice the mice had it go in their belly but then it came out in their breath so water had the oxygen in it but then that oxygen turned up in the exhaled breath which showed that oxygen atoms are exchanged between carbon dioxide molecules and water molecules there's a really good reason for that here's some phenylthaline in water it's a bit hard to pronounce it's got a bit murky because I've left it sit but look if your barn here changes color great whoop-dee-doo what does it show you show you the carbon dioxide dissolves in water forms carbonic acid there's an exchange of oxygen atoms so what this told me is that the way these six atoms are going to leave your body is in the same ratio that they exist in the molecule so that's a two to one ratio so that means four will go out as carbon dioxide and two go it is water that's great now I know the answer so now you do the maths so we've got the first two answers I'm gonna add to the carbons the weight of four of these oxygen atoms they're gonna go out with carbon so check that up there and I've got two to go so two times that there we go check that with the hydrogen's because they're gonna go out with some hydrogen and now I can figure out the ratio of carbon dioxide and water from my fat so there's the totals and now we've just got to divide it by the total total and you get 84% will go out as carbon dioxide and 16% will go out as water so here's the answer then to my big fat question 84% of fat is exhaled 16% is excreted as water somehow it can be in your urine and your feces sweat that means that 10 kilograms of fat becomes eight point four kilograms of invisible gas that you breathe out that's amazing every time you're doing some exercise and your breathing rate goes up you're losing more weight than when you're sitting down and not breathing as rapidly and one point six kilograms will come out as water now we don't know if that comes out in your poo or in your where and your sweater in your tears because you cry a lot who knows but now I've got some frequently asked questions that I need to answer because there's lots of them well there's three main ones one can I just surround a breathe more everyone asks me straight away well you can't sit around and breathe more but it's called hyperventilation you've got a coax 4c 55 h1 Oh 406 out of the fat cells they're called adipocytes and to do it biochemistry made it amazing what really goes on it's a long story but you need to get them out by first of all moving more or eating less you've got to sort of starve yourself of energy so that you start turning these big molecules of fat they get broken into three fatty acids each they're called a triglyceride but they have to be broken apart before they can come out of the cells the hidey-holes that they live in in your bingo wings or you have double chins or your butter your muffin tops or wherever it is it's hanging around in there it's not going to come out until this hormone breaks them apart into its fatty acids it goes into your bloodstream and then you can oxidize them beta oxidation big long story really complicated amazing that we know but FAQ number two is does weight loss cause climate change well this is another really disturbing little thing because it means people don't understand climate change they just don't because if you did you wouldn't even think that but people think so why doesn't it cause climate change because food was made by plants just in the last couple of years and the way it did it was it took sunlight and glued water to carbon dioxide when you eat you're actually the energy is sunlight it was put there by the Sun if I wasn't well I'm not a hippie but I just about am because I think that this is amazing you eat sunlight that's the energy that you get but it's modern sunlight when you burn fossil fuels that's ancient sunlight it's locked up in the ground as carbon in wood Deadwood ancient fossilized coal and oil is ancient dead fossilized critters that lived in the sea that photosynthesize that died that got buried that eventually turned it all this does not cause climate change and the fact that people don't know that means we need to teach them more about climate change no wonder there are so many myths about both these things there are myths about weight loss there are so many diet gurus out there mate if they didn't know this are you gonna trust anything else they have to say to you no hopefully not stop buying their books that pills their rubbish why did you not know this until today I don't know the answer but it certainly makes me very very skeptical about any health claim that anyone makes who's supposedly a guru the third question that you don't get asked but I should get asked that I don't get asked at all except the biochemist would be sitting there wondering it right now did you take into account ketosis and no not really I did not ketosis is when you starve yourself of carbohydrates when there's no glucose in your blood and you can do this thing called ketogenesis your liver does it and can convert fat molecules into ketone bodies there acetone is one of them you go to a nail shop get your nail polish removed acetone right your body makes that stuff but you don't want to make it in huge quantities because you go into acidosis so I'm not going to comment on whether or not eating low protein diets is a good idea because I'm not an expert on that I would say that I'd be careful because it's linked to depression apparently in some papers I don't know I'm not making any health claims about low protein diets what I'm saying is that this is very simple if you just do what I did and what lots and lots and lots of other people I don't want to meddle it's easy all you have to do to lose weight is turn it into carbon dioxide and water and to do that all you have to do is eat less move more and keep reading thank you you""]"
34,0,Intermittent Fasting: Transformational Technique | Cynthia Thurlow | TEDxGreenville,"NOTE FROM TED: Please do not look to this talk for medical advice and consult a medical professional before adopting an intermittent fasting regiment. This talk only represents the speaker’s views on fasting, diet, and health. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...Two-thirds of women 40-59 years old are overweight and more than 1/2 are obese. Intermittent fasting can help women lose weight effectively. And can have profound impact on bio-physical profiles, but also improved self esteem and interpersonal relationships. It is easy to implement, it is inexpensive and flexible.Cynthia is a Western medicine trained nurse practitioner and functional nutritionist who is passionate about female hormonal health. She believes that the inherent power of food and nutrition can be your greatest asset to your health and wellness journey. She works 1:1 with female clients and is the creator of Wholistic Blueprint a 6-week signature program for female hormonal health, she's also the co-host of Everyday Wellness podcast and a recurring segment contributor on her local ABC affiliate in Washington, DC.

(Laughter) What if I told you it is more important\nwhen you eat than what you eat? Perhaps much of the nutritional dogma\nthat we\'ve been raised with is now outdated, like snacking all day long\nand eating many meals. Over the next few minutes,\nI plan to discuss with you what I believe to be the most profoundly\ntransformational concept and strategy as it pertains to health and aging. Over the last 20 years, as a nurse practitioner\nand a functional nutritionist, I\'ve seen tremendous shifts, tremendous shifts in health and wellness: escalating rates of obesity, diabetes\nand cardiovascular disease - many of which are preventable. The choices we make in terms of nutrition\nare profoundly impactful on our health, more than most of us realize. During my training as a nurse practitioner many years ago, the dominant nutritional paradigm\nwas exercise more, eat less. I\'ve found this\nto be profoundly ineffective for most, if not all,\nof my female patients. The concept of ""calories-in,\ncalories-out"" alone is just not effective. Many of the things that I work with,\nwith my female patients really focus on the connection\nbetween our lifestyle choices and how that impacts healthy aging and weight gain. I do not believe, nor do I support,\nthe limiting belief that women have to accept weight gain\nas a normal function of aging. The National Health\nand Nutrition Exam Survey, which looks at data\nwith regard to children and adults in terms of their nutrition\nand escalating obesity rates, compares what went on in the 1970s, where most Americans\nconsumed three meals a day and no snacks; fast forward to today, most of what we are doing as Americans\nis eating three meals a day and snacking all day long. Really. And so one of the things\nthat starts to happen when healthcare providers\nare telling our patients that we need to eat all day long - it\'s wrong. Eating all day long overtaxes\nour pancreas and our digestive system. It overtaxes it so much\nthat it cannot work properly. And if it cannot work properly,\nwe cannot absorb our food or the nutrients in that food. Another really important distinction\nwhen it comes to meal frequency, or how frequently we\'re eating, is the debate over sugar burners\nversus fat burners. And when we\'re talking about that, a sugar burner is someone\nthat consumes lots of carbohydrates and taps into glucose\nas their primary fuel source, which is incredibly inefficient. If you recognize these individuals: They are frequently hungry. They often get hangry. They have - yes - significant dips\nin their energy level. They struggle more with fat loss,\nand they struggle more with their weight because insulin levels are high. Insulin is that fat-storing hormone. So if levels remain high,\nwe have more oxidative stress; we have more inflammation; and we struggle more with weight gain. In sharp contrast to this are fat burners. They tap into fat stores for energy; they have sustained energy; they are much more clear cognitively; they don\'t get hangry; it\'s easier for them to lose weight because they tap into those fat stores; they sleep better;\nand they age more slowly. So meal timing and how frequently\nwe are eating - it\'s absolutely crucial. Absolutely crucial. Let\'s talk about some statistics\nas they pertain to women and healthy aging. So we know two-thirds of women\n40-50 years of age are overweight, and more than half are obese. How do we proactively\naddress this statistic without quick fixes? It makes me want to cry when my female patients\nwould prefer I write them a prescription than work on changing their diet, more exercise, other lifestyle changes. Women in their 50s and 60s\ngain an average of 1.5 pounds per year. Per year. That\'s average. And some of this is attributable\nto things like hormonal fluctuations, women having less lean muscle mass\nthan their male counterparts, sleep disturbances and mood disorders. However, there are strategies\nwe can use to help offset this. So folks, I want you to save your money on potions and powders and supplements\nthat are not long-term solutions. I\'ve got a better idea. And I\'m going to tell you about it. I\'ve got a better idea. There are lots of strategies\nthat I use with my female patients, but none more powerful\nthan intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting\ncan help fuel fat loss as well as many other benefits\nthat I\'ll talk more about in a second. But it also can improve\ninterpersonal relationships and self-esteem. And for many women, this permits them - it\'s the magic bullet that allows them\nto gain back their former selves. Really powerful. And the really cool thing\nabout intermittent fasting is it\'s free, it\'s flexible and it\'s simple. You take nothing else away. Free. Flexible. Simple. So let\'s talk about intermittent fasting. It is the absence of food\nduring a prescribed time period. You exist either in a fed\nor a fasted state. I\'m sure for many of you,\nyou had breakfast this morning. So when you eat, insulin\nis secreted by the pancreas to move sugar into the cells. We store the bulk of our sugar\nin our liver and our skeletal muscle. But when we exceed those storage sites, we store it as fat. When we\'re fasted, insulin levels are low and we can tap into fat stores for energy. Free. Flexible. Simple. And so, when we\'re talking about\nintermittent fasting, it\'s fairly simple. If you skip breakfast - If you skip breakfast in the morning, you can reduce your caloric intake\nby 20 to 40 percent. And the typical time frame\nthat I recommend to my female patients is a 16:8. Sixteen hours a day fasted\nwith an eight-hour feeding window. I know that seems\na little overwhelming at first, but I\'ll give you some strategies\nfor how you go about doing that. So, the 20-40 percent\nreduction in calories means that you can fuel fat loss. So what are some of the benefits\nother than fat loss - fat loss and especially visceral fat\naround our abdomens, around our major organs? We know that it improves mental clarity\nbecause insulin levels are low. We know that it spikes\nhuman growth hormone, which helps us with lean muscle mass. We know that it induces\nsomething called autophagy - I will speak more about this in a second. But this is spring cleaning for the cells. It is only evoked when we are fasted. Autophagy. We know that it lowers insulin levels, blood pressure, improves our cholesterol profile. And we know that it can reduce your risk\nfor developing cancer and Alzheimer\'s disease,\nwhich I like to call type 3 diabetes. If, for no other reason,\nwe want to protect our brains. As wonderful a strategy as this is,\nit is not for everyone. I\'m going to talk briefly about the individuals\nthat want to avoid this strategy. First and foremost,\nif you are a brittle diabetic, or you have difficult-to-control diabetes; if you are a child, an adolescent\nor age greater than 70 - might not be the best strategy; if you are pregnant; if you have chronic heart issues,\nkidney or renal issues - not the best strategy. If you have a history\nof a disordered relationship with food, whether it is anorexia,\nbulimia or binge eating - might not be the best strategy\nbecause it can invoke those tendencies. And last but not least,\nif you have a low body mass index, you\'re frail or you\'ve recently been in the hospital\nlike I was for 13 days. I\'m not currently intermittent fasting. Now, everyone always asks, Well, when you\'re fasting,\nwe know we\'re not eating food, but you can absolutely consume things\nlike filtered water, plain coffee or tea. They will not break your fast. But when you\'re ready to eat,\nwhat do you eat? Now, I would be remiss\nif I did not mention that there are foods that are going to be more\nadvantageous for you to consume when you\'re ready to break your fast. So I want you to focus\non real whole foods. That\'s what your body needs,\nwants and deserves. So I want you to purchase the best quality\nprotein that your budget permits. Ideally, organic or pastured meat,\nwild-caught fish. Healthy fats - so crucial - helpful for building healthy hormones and also really important for satiety -\nmaking sure our taste buds light up, make us happy. I\'m not part of the anti-fat brigade. Really, really important. Twenty years ago, I might\nhave told you not to eat fat, but now we know better. So I want you to focus\non things like avocados, coconut oil, grass-fed butter and nuts -\nreally great, healthy fats. Unprocessed carbohydrates. Ladies, absolutely crucial, if you\'re in perimenopause,\nthe five to seven years before menopause, or you\'re in menopause, quality and quantity are crucial. So I want you to consume things\nlike low-glycemic berries, green leafy vegetables, squash,\nquinoa, sweet potatoes as opposed to bread and pasta. Cautionary tale: I want you\nto limit sugar and alcohol. By that I mean, I want you\nto not consume those things because they can offset\nall the good that you\'re doing. And lastly, keep yourself well hydrated. Now, I want to make sure that I briefly touch on\nsome of the practical implications for how you would go about\nstarting intermittent fasting. Generally, I have my ladies\nstart with 12-13 hours of fasted period. And they can slowly increase\nby an hour or so every day until they\'ve reached that 16 hour mark. Again, you want to keep yourself\nreally well hydrated. You can also have plain coffee or tea. In addition to that, you want to ensure\nthat you give it a solid 30 days before you determine\nif it\'s the right strategy for you. And if you have chronic health conditions, I want to make sure you discuss it\nwith your healthcare provider. Really important. And recognize it may take\nsix to eight weeks to really see the full benefits\nof what you\'re doing. The biggest pain point\nfor my female patients is weight gain. I have a fantastic strategy\nto help with this, but I don\'t want you to buy into\nthe next $50 container of protein powder or the hottest weight loss\nsupplement that\'s out there. I want you to think about the fact\nthis is a simple, flexible and free option that you can try at home, discuss with your healthcare\nprovider if necessary. I really feel so passionately about this because it\'s something that all of us\nshould be discussing with our patients. Thank you. (Applause)']"
35,0,Recipe to losing weight | Anna Verhulst | TEDxMaastricht,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Anna Verhulst (23) is a fifth year medical student at Maastricht University, doing her internship in Eindhoven. She has a particular interest in the fields of oncology and sports medicine, but isn’t quite sure yet what kind of doctor she wants to become when she graduates in 2016. Anna is a keen writer, sharing her experiences as a junior intern through columns, essays and opinion pieces. A selection of her publications can be found at annaverhulst.blogspot.nl. In between her internships, she is also involved in a research project that explores the possibilities of exercise rehabilitation in cancer survivors.On stage at TEDx Maastricht 2014, Anna will share a story that she has purposely kept silent for a long time. It is a story that has nothing to do with her work as a medical student, researcher or writer. It is her personal story, for which she has finally worked up the courage to share it with the public.Website: http://tedxmaastricht.nlFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxmaa...Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/TEDxMaastrichtTwitter: https://twitter.com/TEDxMaastrichtAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

And I mean our average caveman\nin the Stone Age had to walk for up to 16 kilometers a day, had to chase his prey for days on end, so then when he finally made his kill, he could rightfully stuff\nhis face with meat and eat as much as he wanted. However, nowadays,\novereating is a global problem and the cause of many\nsevere health threats. 44% of the diabetes burden,\n23% of the ischemic heart disease burden, and up to 41% of certain \ncancer burdens are linked to obesity. So, these numbers are the things\nyou learn from text books, the facts everyone \ncan look up on the Internet, but once I started working\nin the hospital as a junior intern, and met people \nwho were struggling with obesity, I realized that it\'s often not\nthese physical consequences that seem to matter most to those \nwho are overweight themselves. Let\'s take a look at the picture\nof this girl as an example. The quote that came to my mind\nwhen I saw this picture was: ""To lose confidence in one\'s body,\nis to lose confidence in oneself."" Because the girl you see\nis only 15 years old, but already weighs over 100 kilograms, and tonight she\'s going\nto her high school\'s prom, and you can see she\'s all dressed up,\nposing for a picture, probably taken by one of her parents. And yet, in spite of the brave smile\nshe\'s putting up, you can also instantly\nsense her insecurity. You can see she\'s not really\nlooking forward to the night. Only 15 years old\nwith a whole life ahead of her, and already she has\nlost confidence in herself. This is only one example of people\nwho are severely unhappy in their body, but still can\'t manage to lose weight. And it made me wonder why because there are stacks of books\non how to lose weight, web pages full of tips and tricks, and plenty of experts to guide\nyou through the process. So, if it\'s not for a lack of tools\nthen why is it so many of us can\'t manage to lose weight\nor keep the weight off? And I ask myself all these questions, and then, as we are taught\nwithin the problem-based learning system here at Maastricht University, I realized that the best way to find\nthe answer was to go look for it myself. And so I stumbled upon some research\non the science of complexity by two professors\nat York University in Canada. And I found their theory\nsurprisingly applicable to the process of losing weight. You see, they proposed there are\nthree types of problems in the world: the simple, the complicated,\nand the complex. So, simple problems are \nthe ones like following a recipe. You need some basic techniques\nand perhaps a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, following the recipe has\na very high chance of success. Complicated problems cover problems \nlike sending a rocket to the Moon, which does sound pretty complicated to me. However, complicated problems\ncan often be broken down into a string of simple problems. So when coordinated well, these complicated problems\nstill carry a high rate of success. Finally, complex problems\nare the ones like raising a child. There is no recipe for success. And while raising one child\nmay certainly provide experience, it doesn\'t guarantee success\nwith the next child because every child is unique and may require\nan entirely different approach. So, our cavemen in the Stone Age didn\'t have any notice of complexity,\nhis life was simple, and basic, and as simple pretty much as it could be. But, nowadays, in our modern time, the process of losing weight definitely\nseems to be a complex problem, there is no recipe for success. And certainly there may be\nsome basic ingredients, eating differently,\nchanging your exercise pattern, but there are no standard tools to use, and no definitive order\nof steps to follow. The remarkable thing is that many things\nin our environment suggest that losing weight is, in fact,\nsimply a matter of following a recipe. Drink these shakes, eat \nthese protein bars, skip all carbs, drink gallons of water, avoid all sugars,\nand you will lose weight, and you will be happy forever, and you will never feel insecure\nin your life anymore, ever, right? No. I\'d like to take you back to the picture\nof the girl we saw at the beginning because the next picture is\nthe same girl one year later. And seven years later,\nshe\'s standing here right in front of you sharing a story that appears to be now\nabout as personal as it gets. And five months ago I told my story for the very first time\nat the TEDxMaastricht pitch night. I showed the audience\nthe same two pictures leaving the second one\nto right before the end. When I told them that it was\nthe same girl as in the first picture, an audible sigh of genuine surprise\nwent through the public because they realized, as you do \nby now, that that girl was me. And what struck me most\nafter the pitch night were not the kind words from my friends, and not the compliments\nfrom strangers in the audience. No, it was that audible sigh\nof genuine surprise that I had heard\nwhen showing the second picture that quite confused me. You see, I had never expected\nthat anyone seeing that first picture wouldn\'t immediately recognize\nthe girl to be me because whenever\nI picture myself in my head, I still look that way. Seven years after physically\nlosing 40 kilos, I still struggle to recognize \nthe way my body looks now. And it confused me\nbecause I\'d always thought that losing weight was as simple as,\nwell, losing the weight. So, only a moment ago, I told you about\nhow losing weight is a complex problem, that there are no standard tools to use and no definitive order\nof steps to follow. But most importantly,\nthat it\'s a personal problem requiring a personal solution, it\'s a matter of compiling your own\npersonal recipe to losing weight. So, have I found all the ingredients\nto my recipe of losing weight and keeping the weight off \nand being happy with my new body? I think that in past few years\nI have found out about quite a few things that work for me, but it\'s the final seasoning of the dish\nthat\'s still a bit of a struggle. You see, it\'s scary as hell to admit\nthat sometimes I\'m still feeling fat, and that when I look in the mirror\nI struggle to recognize the same image other people \nsee when looking at me, and that sharing my story with you today, means overcoming one of my biggest fears. Because what I\'m scared of most is not that I stumble on words\nor forget my lines; what I\'m scared of most\nis that when I leave this stage, you will look at your neighbor,\nraise an eyebrow, and say: ""I don\'t get why she\'s on stage;\nshe\'s still fat."" But I also know that that fear is\nirrational, as are many fears, and I no longer want to be scared\nbecause a great man once said that: ""Courage is not the absence of fear\nbut the triumph over it,"" and that: ""the brave man is not he\nwho is not afraid, but he who conquers that fear."" And maybe, the triumph\nover one of my biggest fears is that final seasoning my dish needs, my final step to completing\nmy recipe to losing weight. So, as long as I\'m still scared,\nI will continue to conquer my fear, and I will continue to tell my story until I no longer need\nto summon up any courage to tell people that I used \nto be fat, but no longer am. And I hope some of you may\nfind comfort in this story, knowing that losing weight \nand being happy with your new body is not always as easy as\nour society makes you think. And I hope you will find\nyour own ingredients and compile your own recipe. And do remember, that, in the end,\nit\'s only one person that has to be satisfied\nwith the taste of the final dish. And that person is you. Thank you. (Applause)']"

Subscribed to our channel for more.,The Democrats,s34NWArsxVw,"[""good evening everybody welcome to the White House Correspondents Dinner the night when Washington celebrates itself somebody's got to do it and welcome to the fourth quarter of my presidency it's true why that was Michelle cheering fact is I feel more loose and relaxed than ever those Joe Biden's shoulder massages they're like magic there's a trauma or you have I am to make the most of every moment I have left after the midterm elections my advisers asked me mr. president do you have a bucket list and I said well I have something that rhymes with bucket list take executive action on immigration bucket this Harmon regulations bucket right thing to do my new attitude is paying off look at my Cuba policy the Castro brothers are here tonight welcome to America I move us que pasa what it's for Castro's from Texas Oh Iowa cream hi who Leone anyway being president is never easy I still have to fix a broken immigration system issue veto threats negotiate with Iran all while finding time to pray five times a day and it is no wonder that people keep pointing out how the presidency has aged me I look so old John Boehner czar to invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral meanwhile Miss has an age today I asked her what her secret is she just says fresh fruits and vegetables it's aggravating fact is though at this point my legacy is finally beginning to take shape the economy is getting better 9 in 10 Americans now have health coverage today thanks to Obamacare you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job you're welcome Senate Democrats not look it is true I have not managed to make everybody happy six years into my presidency some people still say I'm arrogant and aloof condescending some people are so dumb no wonder I don't meet with them and that's not all people say about me a few weeks ago Dick Cheney says he thinks I'm the worst president of his lifetime which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime what a coincidence everybody's got something to say these days Mike Huckabee recently said people shouldn't join our military until a true conservative is elected president think about that rageous 47 ayatollahs wrote us a letter trying to explain to huckabee how our system works it gets worse just this week Michelle Bachman ash actually predicted that I would bring about the biblical end of days now that's a legacy as big I mean Lincoln Washington they didn't do that but you know I just had to put this stuff aside I've got to stay focused on my job because for many Americans this is still a time of deep uncertainty for example I have a I have one friend just a few weeks ago she was making millions of dollars a year and she's now living out of a van in Iowa meanwhile back in our nation's capital we're always dealing with new challenges I'm happy to report that the Secret Service thanks to some excellent reporting by white house correspondents they're really focusing on some of the issues that have come up and they finally figured out a foolproof way to keep people off my lawn as works as not just fence jumpers a few months ago a drone crash landed out back that was pretty serious but don't worry we've installed a new state-of-the-art security system you know what let me set the record straight you know I tease Joe sometimes but he has been at my side for seven years I love that man he's not just a great vice president he is a great friend I we've gotten so close in some places in Indiana they won't serve us pizza anymore I want to thank our hosts for the evening Chicago girl be incredibly talented Cicely strong on Saturday Night Live Cicely impersonates CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin which is surprising because usually the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are journalists on CNN ABC is here with some of the stars from their big new comedy blackish it's a great show but I have to give ABC fair warning being blackish only makes you popular for so long trust me there's a shelf-life to that thing as always the reporters here had a lot to cover over the last year here on the East Coast one big story was the brutal winter the polar vortex blows they renamed it MSNBC but of course let's face it there is one issue on every reporter's minds and that is 2016 already we've seen some missteps it turns out Jeb Bush identified himself as Hispanic back in 2009 what you know what I look I understand it's an innocent mistake reminds me of when I identified myself as American back in 1961 Ted Cruz said that denying the existence of climate change may made him like Galileo now that's not really an apt comparison Galileo believed the Earth revolves around the Sun Ted Cruz believes the Earth revolves around Ted Cruz and this is an aside I want to point out when a guy who has his face on a hope poster calls you self-centered you know you've got a problem the narcissism index is creeping up a little too high meanwhile Rick Santorum announced that he would not attend the same-sex wedding of a friend or a loved one to which gays and lesbians across the country responded that's not going to be a problem don't sweat that one and Donald Trump is here still anyway it's amazing how time flies soon the first presidential contest will take place and I for one cannot wait to see who the Koch brothers pick it's exciting Marco Rubio Rand Paul Ted Cruz Jeb Bush Scott Walker who will finally get that red rose the winner gets a billion dollar war chest the runner-up gets to be the bachelor on the next season of The Bachelor mysteriously a billion dollars from just two guys is it just me or does that feel a little excessive it's almost insulting to the candidates though the Koch brothers think they need to spend a billion dollars to get folks to like one of these people it's got to hurt their feelings a little bit and look I know I've raised a lot of money too but in all fairness my middle name is Hussein what's the excuse the trail hasn't been easy for my fellow Democrats either as we all know Hillary's private emails got her in trouble frankly I thought it was going to be a private Instagram account that was going to cause her bigger problems hilary kicks things off by going completely unrecognized and it's your polling not to be outdone martin o'malley kick things off completely unrecognized that a martin o'malley campaign event and Bernie Sanders might run I like burning Bernie's an interesting guy apparently some folks really want to see a pot-smoking socialist in the White House we could get a third Obama term after all could happen anyway as always I want to close on a more serious note and I often joke about tensions between me and the press but honestly what they say doesn't bother me I understand we've got an adversarial system I'm a mellow sort of guy and that's why I invited Luther my anger translator to join me here tonight hold on to your lily-white butts in our fast-changing world traditions like the White House Correspondents Dinner are important because despite our differences we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day then we could count on Fox News to terrify all white people responses ridiculous we won't always see eye to eye in CNN thank you so much for the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage but two whole weeks we were one step away from the walking dead that was awesome oh and by the way just if you've noticed you don't have Ebola but I still deeply appreciate the work that you do don't know what I had that big old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and then I plugged it remember that which Obama's Katrina was that one was at 19 over was a 22 doctor I can remember protecting our democracy is more important than ever for example the Supreme Court ruled that the donor who gave Ted Cruz six million dollars was just exercising free speech yeah it's the kind of speech like this I just wasted six million dollars and it's not just Republicans Hillary will have to rage use sums of money - Oh so go get that money she'll get off all the money Khaleesi is coming to Westeros Oh an unsent focus on billionaire donors creates real problems for our democracy that's why we've got it no we're not we're not who the hell said that but we do need to stay focused on some big challenges like climate change this is odd you haven't noticed California is bone dry it looked like a trailer for the new Mad Max movie up in there y'all think that Bradley Cooper came here because he wants to talk to Chuck Todd he needed a glass of water the science is clear the science is clear nine out of the ten hottest years ever came in the last decade not a lot of scientists but I do know how to conjugate rising seas more violent storms got mosquitos sweaty people on the train stinking it up is just nasty look at is what look at what's happening right now every serious scientist says we need to act the Pentagon says it's a national security risk Miami floods on a sunny day and instead of doing anything about it we've got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate it's okay I think I got it Brian it is crazy what about our kids what kind of stupid short-sighted irresponsible Hey whoa all due respect sir you don't need an anger translator you need counsel and I'm out of here man I try to get into all this go Luther my anger translator is young now that I got that off my chest you know investigative journalism explanatory Pleasant journalism that exposes corruption and injustice and gives voice to the different and the marginalized the voiceless that's power it's a privilege it's as important to America's trajectory to our values our ideals than anything that we could do in elected office we remember journalists we lost over the past year journalists like steven sotloff and james foley murdered for nothing more than trying to shine a light into some of the world's darkest corners we remember the journalists unjustly imprisoned around the world including our own jason raize an for nine months jason has been imprisoned in Tehran for nothing more than writing about the hopes and the fears of the Iranian people carrying their stories to the readers of The Washington Post an effort to bridge our common humanity as was already mentioned Jason's brother Ali is here tonight and I have told him personally we will not rest until we bring him home to his family safe and sound these journalists and so many others view their work is more than just a profession but as a public good an indispensable pillar of our society so I want to give a toast to them I raise a glass to them and all of you with the words of the American foreign correspondent Dorothy Thompson it is not the fact of Liberty Liberty is exercised that ultimately determines whether Liberty itself survives thank you for your devotion to exercising our Liberty and in telling our American story god bless you god bless the United States of America""]"
37,1,Covid-19: why the economy could fare worse than you think | The Economist,"Three months after lockdown was relaxed in China, its economy is now running at around 90% of normal levels.

life after lockdown China's economy is now functioning it's around 90 percent of normal levels 90 percent is an incredible achievement but in practice will feel very very strange a 90 percent economy may not sound too bad but for many it could be catastrophic some of the worst unemployment numbers in this country's history 6.6 million plus people laid off in a single week it wouldn't be that surprising if we think we kind of through the worst of it we end a lockdown and then actually been finished that's it even worse as global lock downs ease the economy faces the greatest challenge in living memory here's what you need to know [Music] in China factories are up and running classrooms are full restaurants are open but the economy has not returned to normal in fact its operating at around 90% of usual levels and as lockdowns e's elsewhere this 90% economy could be what the rest of the world has to look forward to regardless of how countries have dealt with the pandemic it's becoming clear that once businesses have to operate with social distancing in place the economy can be expected to shrink by about 10 percent whether that's in South Korea America or Sweden but the missing 10% will mean life will feel far from normal in China large chunks of everyday life are missing having collapsed in January consumer footfall has recovered to about half its previous levels hotel occupancy is still down by around 50% and 75% fewer people are flying what's mainly in the missing 10% is stuff that it's hard to do if you're trying to social visit so things like restaurants at hotels theaters cinemas and crucially it's also the way in which people tend to have fun there's a world where you work and then as soon as the day is over you immediately get back to your house as fast as possible this dip in so-called fun spending will continue even after lockdowns are relaxed in Sweden most people were never asked to stay at home during the pandemic but Swedish spending patterns over the past few months have mirrored those in neighboring Denmark which has been under lockdown daily restaurant turnover fell by 70 percent last month as uncertainty over the economy and fear of infection meant fewer Swedes ate out and while overall Danish spending fell by 29 percent during lockdown Swedes cut their spending by almost as much what the evidence suggests now is that actually it's people's own voluntary decisions about how they behave with shaping economies actually more than what the government is telling people to do the lockdown itself is not really influencing behavior that much the true economic impact of imposing lockdowns will take time to emerge in China it was several months after the lockdown began to be lifted before bankruptcy numbers started to rise it wouldn't be that surprising if we think we kind of through the worst of it we end the lockdown and then actually bail in film starts to get even worse than we had expected for the past few months the global economy has been propped up by unprecedented levels of state aid in Europe's five largest economies one in five workers is currently in a special scheme where the state pays their wages the governor has deployed 750 billion euros to sustain companies that's unprecedented the government is going to step in and help to pay people's wages it's only as this support is gradually withdrawn that the wider cost of covert 19 will become clear it will feel quite sort of uncertain because you know no one really knows how businesses and households are going to be able to survive weeks and months of of much lower incomes it will impact all levels of the economy let's take a look at one scenario a small business owner runs a chain of restaurants when the pandemic hits he takes out a loan and furloughs his staff he's not alone in March more cash was handed out to UK businesses than in any month since records began after lockdown he reopened but business is slow so he makes staff redundant and closes a restaurant as he can't pay the rent this has already been happening in the first quarter of the year the share of commercial tenants who paid their rent on time in Britain fell from ninety percent to 60 percent with big firms like Burger King admitting they couldn't make rent on empty restaurants without these rent payments his landlord can no longer keep up with her mortgage and ultimately her bank is left with debt that cannot be repaid the problem with all of these losses across the economy is that someone eventually has to sort of admit that they are going to bear these losses and the color consequences of that for business confidence and for investment could be could be very significant if you are concerned that your customers or your tenants or whoever is not going to actually be paying the money they owe you then making new investments is not just risky it's actually completely impossible to price because everything is so unstable and so the risk of that is that things like investment get cut back massively and that will you know that will have very large effects key economic factors already indicate that the world is facing a prolonged recession already unemployment in America is at its highest rate since the Great Depression but these losses will not be felt equally to see how let's go back to our restaurant owner the industry's hit hardest by the clover 19 pandemic our labor intensive and rely on an army of low paid workers and it is these people who are particularly likely to lose their jobs in America you are already twice as likely to be made redundant if you're earning less than $20,000 a year then $80,000 a year the kind of jobs that won't exist at all or in much reduced numbers will be the kind of jobs that are typically done by people who are paid less john started on by women and jobs that are done by I think minorities more commonly so that's jobs and things like pleasure hospitality retail trade and that kind of thing so I think you could expect an employment to be really concentrated in certain groups and these economic changes will shape the political agenda in the post lockdown world you can imagine a situation where it becomes kind of common sensical that the essential workers who've kept the economy going you can imagine a push towards trying to improve their standard of living and standard of work on the other hand you could imagine a situation where countries kind of closed it on themselves and say you know we don't want to move boats because immigrants bringing disease and we want to make sure that we have capacity to build vaccines for our citizens for no one else it's too soon to know which way the political tide will turn and each country's response will be different but one certainty is that the longer we all have to wait for a vaccine to be developed and distributed or effective treatment found the more pronounced the effects of the 90% economy will be my name

38,0,President Obama Addresses the British Parliament,"In an address to Parliament, President Obama discusses how the special relationship between the United States and Great Britain can continue to help the two nations serve as catalysts for global action as the world faces a new series of threats and challenges. May 25, 2011.",The Obama White House,fp85zRg2cwg,"['Speaker:\nMr. President,\nladies and gentlemen, history is more than the\npath left by the past. It influences the present\nand can shape the future. We meet today in\nWestminster Hall, a building begun 900 years ago\nwhen the Vikings were visiting the shores of what would\nbecome the United States, even if it was Columbus who\nwould subsequently demonstrate the politician\'s art\nof arriving late, but claiming all the credit. (laughter) This hall has witnessed grim\ntrials in the sentencing to death of a king, coronation\nbanquets, ceremonial addresses, and the coffins of those\nreceiving the last respects of our people. Few places reach so far into\nthe heart of our nation. Yet until today, no American\npresident has stood on these steps to address our\ncountry\'s Parliament. It is my honor, Mr. President,\nto welcome you as our friend and as a statesman. Statesmanship is the cement\nwhich seals our shared idealism as nations. It makes meaningful the unity of\nambition, passion for freedom, and abhorrence of injustice\nthat is the call of our close alliance. It has fallen to you to tackle\neconomic turbulence at home, to protect the health\nof those without wealth, and to seek that precious\nbalance between security which is too often threatened, and\nhuman rights which are too often denied. History is not the burden of\nany one man or woman alone. But some are called to\nmeet a special share of it\'s challenges. It is a duty that you discharge\nwith a dignity, determination, and distinction that\nare widely admired. Abraham Lincoln once observed\nthat nearly all men can stand adversity. But if you want to test a man\'s\ncharacter, give him power. Ladies and gentlemen, the\nPresident of the United States of America, Barack Obama. (applause) President Obama:\nThank you very much. (applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. (applause) Thank you. (applause) Thank you so much. (applause) My Lord Chancellor, Mr. Speaker,\nMr. Prime Minister, my lords, and members of the\nHouse of Commons: I have known few greater honors\nthan the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments\nat Westminster Hall. I am told that the last three\nspeakers here have been the Pope, Her Majesty the\nQueen, and Nelson Mandela -- which is either a very high\nbar or the beginning of a very funny joke. (laughter) I come here today to\nreaffirm one of the oldest, one of the strongest alliances\nthe world has ever known. It\'s long been said that the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom share a\nspecial relationship. And since we also share an\nespecially active press corps, that relationship is often\nanalyzed and overanalyzed for the slightest hint\nof stress or strain. Of course, all relationships\nhave their ups and downs. Admittedly, ours got off on the\nwrong foot with a small scrape about tea and taxes. (laughter) There may also have been\nsome hurt feelings when the White House was set on fire\nduring the War of 1812. (laughter) But fortunately, it\'s been\nsmooth sailing ever since. The reason for this close\nfriendship doesn\'t just have to do with our shared history,\nour shared heritage; our ties of language\nand culture; or even the strong partnership\nbetween our governments. Our relationship is special\nbecause of the values and beliefs that have united\nour people through the ages. Centuries ago, when\nkings, emperors, and warlords reigned\nover much of the world, it was the English who first\nspelled out the rights and liberties of man\nin the Magna Carta. It was here, in this very hall,\nwhere the rule of law first developed, courts\nwere established, disputes were settled, and\ncitizens came to petition their leaders. Over time, the people of\nthis nation waged a long and sometimes bloody struggle\nto expand and secure their freedom from the crown. Propelled by the ideals\nof the Enlightenment, they would ultimately forge\nan English Bill of Rights, and invest the power to govern\nin an elected parliament that\'s gathered here today. What began on this island would\ninspire millions throughout the continent of Europe\nand across the world. But perhaps no one drew greater\ninspiration from these notions of freedom than your\nrabble-rousing colonists on the other side\nof the Atlantic. As Winston Churchill\nsaid, the ""...Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, Habeas\nCorpus, trial by jury, and English common law find\ntheir most famous expression in the American Declaration\nof Independence."" For both of our nations, living\nup to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents has\nsometimes been difficult, has always been a\nwork in progress. The path has never been perfect. But through the struggles\nof slaves and immigrants, women and ethnic minorities,\nformer colonies and persecuted religions, we have learned\nbetter than most that the longing for freedom and human\ndignity is not English or American or Western\n-- it is universal, and it beats in every heart. Perhaps that\'s why there are\nfew nations that stand firmer, speak louder, and fight harder\nto defend democratic values around the world than the United\nStates and the United Kingdom. We are the allies who\nlanded at Omaha and Gold, who sacrificed side by side to\nfree a continent from the march of tyranny, and help prosperity\nflourish from the ruins of war. And with the founding of\nNATO -- a British idea -- we joined a transatlantic\nalliance that has ensured our security for over\nhalf a century. Together with our allies,\nwe forged a lasting peace from a cold war. When the Iron Curtain lifted, we\nexpanded our alliance to include the nations of Central\nand Eastern Europe, and built new bridges to Russia\nand the former states of the Soviet Union. And when there was\nstrife in the Balkans, we worked together\nto keep the peace. Today, after a difficult decade\nthat began with war and ended in recession, our nations have\narrived at a pivotal moment once more. A global economy that once stood\non the brink of depression is now stable and recovering. After years of conflict, the\nUnited States has removed 100,000 troops from Iraq, the\nUnited Kingdom has removed its forces, and our combat\nmission there has ended. In Afghanistan, we\'ve broken the\nTaliban\'s momentum and will soon begin a transition\nto Afghan lead. And nearly 10 years after 9/11,\nwe have disrupted terrorist networks and dealt al Qaeda a\nhuge blow by killing its leader -- Osama bin Laden. Together, we have\nmet great challenges. But as we enter this new\nchapter in our shared history, profound challenges\nstretch out before us. In a world where the prosperity\nof all nations is now inextricably linked, a new era\nof cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stability\nof the global economy. As new threats spread\nacross borders and oceans, we must dismantle terrorist\nnetworks and stop the spread of nuclear weapons, confront\nclimate change and combat famine and disease. And as a revolution races\nthrough the streets of the Middle East and North Africa,\nthe entire world has a stake in the aspirations of a\ngeneration that longs to determine its own destiny. These challenges come at a time\nwhen the international order has already been reshaped\nfor a new century. Countries like China, India,\nand Brazil are growing by leaps and bounds. We should welcome\nthis development, for it has lifted hundreds of\nmillions from poverty around the globe, and created new\nmarkets and opportunities for our own nations. And yet, as this rapid\nchange has taken place, it\'s become fashionable in some\nquarters to question whether the rise of these nations will\naccompany the decline of American and European\ninfluence around the world. Perhaps, the argument goes,\nthese nations represent the future, and the time for\nour leadership has passed. That argument is wrong. The time for our\nleadership is now. It was the United States and\nthe United Kingdom and our democratic allies that shaped a\nworld in which new nations could emerge and individuals\ncould thrive. And even as more nations take on\nthe responsibilities of global leadership, our alliance will\nremain indispensable to the goal of a century that\nis more peaceful, more prosperous and more just. At a time when threats and\nchallenges require nations to work in concert\nwith one another, we remain the greatest\ncatalysts for global action. In an era defined by the\nrapid flow of commerce and information, it is our free\nmarket tradition, our openness, fortified by our commitment to\nbasic security for our citizens, that offers the best chance\nof prosperity that is both strong and shared. As millions are still denied\ntheir basic human rights because of who they are, or\nwhat they believe, or the kind of government\nthat they live under, we are the nations most willing\nto stand up for the values of tolerance and self-determination\nthat lead to peace and dignity. Now, this doesn\'t mean we\ncan afford to stand still. The nature of our leadership will\nneed to change with the times. As I said the first time I\ncame to London as President, for the G20 summit, the days\nare gone when Roosevelt and Churchill could sit in a room\nand solve the world\'s problems over a glass of brandy --\nalthough I\'m sure that Prime Minister Cameron would agree\nthat some days we could both use a stiff drink. (laughter) In this century, our joint\nleadership will require building new partnerships,\nadapting to new circumstances, and remaking ourselves to meet\nthe demands of a new era. That begins with our\neconomic leadership. Adam Smith\'s central insight\nremains true today: There is no greater generator of wealth and\ninnovation than a system of free enterprise that unleashes the\nfull potential of individual men and women. That\'s what led to the\nIndustrial Revolution that began in the factories of Manchester. That is what led to the dawn of\nthe Information Age that arose from the office parks\nof Silicon Valley. That\'s why countries like China,\nIndia and Brazil are growing so rapidly -- because\nin fits and starts, they are moving toward\nmarket-based principles that the United States and the United\nKingdom have always embraced. In other words, we live in a\nglobal economy that is largely of our own making. And today, the competition for\nthe best jobs and industries favors countries that\nare free-thinking and forward-looking; countries with\nthe most creative and innovative and entrepreneurial citizens. That gives nations like the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom an inherent advantage. For from Newton and Darwin\nto Edison and Einstein, from Alan Turing to Steve Jobs,\nwe have led the world in our commitment to science and\ncutting-edge research, the discovery of new\nmedicines and technologies. We educate our citizens and\ntrain our workers in the best colleges and\nuniversities on Earth. But to maintain this advantage\nin a world that\'s more competitive than ever, we will\nhave to redouble our investments in science and engineering, and\nrenew our national commitments to educating our workforces. We\'ve also been reminded in the\nlast few years that markets can sometimes fail. In the last century, both our\nnations put in place regulatory frameworks to deal with such\nmarket failures -- safeguards to protect the banking system\nafter the Great Depression, for example; regulations that\nwere established to prevent the pollution of our air and\nour water during the 1970s. But in today\'s economy, such\nthreats of market failure can no longer be contained within\nthe borders of any one country. Market failures can go\nglobal, and go viral, and demand international responses. A financial crisis that began\non Wall Street infected nearly every continent, which is why we\nmust keep working through forums like the G20 to put in place\nglobal rules of the road to prevent future\nexcesses and abuse. No country can hide from the\ndangers of carbon pollution, which is why we must build on\nwhat was achieved at Copenhagen and Cancun to leave our\nchildren a planet that is safer and cleaner. Moreover, even when the free\nmarket works as it should, both our countries recognize\nthat no matter how responsibly we live in our lives,\nhard times or bad luck, a crippling illness or a layoff\nmay strike any one of us. And so part of our common\ntradition has expressed itself in a conviction that every\ncitizen deserves a basic measure of security -- health\ncare if you get sick, unemployment insurance\nif you lose your job, a dignified retirement after\na lifetime of hard work. That commitment to our citizens\nhas also been the reason for our leadership in the world. And now, having come through\na terrible recession, our challenge is to meet these\nobligations while ensuring that we\'re not consuming -- and hence\nconsumed -- with a level of debt that could sap the strength\nand vitality of our economies. And that will require difficult\nchoices and it will require different paths for\nboth of our countries. But we have faced such\nchallenges before, and have always been able to\nbalance the need for fiscal responsibility with the\nresponsibilities we have to one another. And I believe we\ncan do this again. As we do, the successes and\nfailures of our own past can serve as an example for emerging\neconomies -- that it\'s possible to grow without polluting; that\nlasting prosperity comes not from what a nation consumes,\nbut from what it produces, and from the investments\nit makes in its people and its infrastructure. And just as we must lead on\nbehalf of the prosperity of our citizens, so we must\nsafeguard their security. Our two nations know what it is\nto confront evil in the world. Hitler\'s armies would not have\nstopped their killing had we not fought them on the beaches\nand on the landing grounds, in the fields and\non the streets. We must never forget that there\nwas nothing inevitable about our victory in that terrible war. It was won through the courage\nand character of our people. Precisely because we are\nwilling to bear its burden, we know well the cost of war. And that is why we built an\nalliance that was strong enough to defend this continent\nwhile deterring our enemies. At its core, NATO is rooted in\nthe simple concept of Article Five: that no NATO nation\nwill have to fend on its own; that allies will stand\nby one another, always. And for six decades, NATO\nhas been the most successful alliance in human history. Today, we confront\na different enemy. Terrorists have taken the lives\nof our citizens in New York and in London. And while al Qaeda seeks a\nreligious war with the West, we must remember that they have\nkilled thousands of Muslims -- men, women and children\n-- around the globe. Our nations are not and will\nnever be at war with Islam. Our fight is focused on\ndefeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies. In that effort, we\nwill not relent, as Osama bin Laden and his\nfollowers have learned. And as we fight an enemy\nthat respects no law of war, we will continue to hold\nourselves to a higher standard -- by living up to the values,\nthe rule of law and due process that we so ardently defend. For almost a decade, Afghanistan\nhas been a central front of these efforts. Throughout those years,\nyou, the British people, have been a stalwart ally, along\nwith so many others who fight by our side. Together, let us pay tribute to\nall of our men and women who have served and sacrificed over\nthe last several years -- for they are part of an unbroken\nline of heroes who have borne the heaviest burden for the\nfreedoms that we enjoy. Because of them, we have\nbroken the Taliban\'s momentum. Because of them, we have\nbuilt the capacity of Afghan security forces. And because of them, we are now\npreparing to turn a corner in Afghanistan by transitioning\nto Afghan lead. And during this transition, we\nwill pursue a lasting peace with those who break free of al\nQaeda and respect the Afghan constitution and lay down arms. And we will ensure that\nAfghanistan is never a safe haven for terror, but is instead\na country that is strong, sovereign, and able to\nstand on its own two feet. Indeed, our efforts in this\nyoung century have led us to a new concept for NATO that will\ngive us the capabilities needed to meet new threats -- threats\nlike terrorism and piracy, cyber attacks and\nballistic missiles. But a revitalized NATO will\ncontinue to hew to that original vision of its founders, allowing\nus to rally collective action for the defense of our people,\nwhile building upon the broader belief of Roosevelt and\nChurchill that all nations have both rights and\nresponsibilities, and all nations share a common\ninterest in an international architecture that\nmaintains the peace. We also share a common interest\nin stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. Across the globe, nations are\nlocking down nuclear materials so they never fall into\nthe wrong hands -- because of our leadership. From North Korea to Iran, we\'ve\nsent a message that those who flaunt their obligations will\nface consequences -- which is why America and the European\nUnion just recently strengthened our sanctions on Iran, in large\npart because of the leadership of the United Kingdom\nand the United States. And while we hold\nothers to account, we will meet our own obligations\nunder the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and strive for a world\nwithout nuclear weapons. We share a common interest in\nresolving conflicts that prolong human suffering and threaten\nto tear whole regions asunder. In Sudan, after years of\nwar and thousands of deaths, we call on both North and South\nto pull back from the brink of violence and choose\nthe path of peace. And in the Middle East, we stand\nunited in our support for a secure Israel and a\nsovereign Palestine. And we share a common interest\nin development that advances dignity and security. To succeed, we must cast\naside the impulse to look at impoverished parts of the\nglobe as a place for charity. Instead, we should empower the\nsame forces that have allowed our own people to thrive: We\nshould help the hungry to feed themselves, the doctors\nwho care for the sick. We should support countries\nthat confront corruption, and allow their\npeople to innovate. And we should advance the truth\nthat nations prosper when they allow women and girls to\nreach their full potential. We do these things because we\nbelieve not simply in the rights of nations; we believe in\nthe rights of citizens. That is the beacon that guided\nus through our fight against fascism and our twilight\nstruggle against communism. And today, that idea is being\nput to the test in the Middle East and North Africa. In country after country,\npeople are mobilizing to free themselves from the\ngrip of an iron fist. And while these movements for\nchange are just six months old, we have seen them play out\nbefore -- from Eastern Europe to the Americas, from South\nAfrica to Southeast Asia. History tells us that\ndemocracy is not easy. It will be years before these\nrevolutions reach their conclusion, and there will be\ndifficult days along the way. Power rarely gives up without a\nfight -- particularly in places where there are divisions of\ntribe and divisions of sect. We also know that populism can\ntake dangerous turns -- from the extremism of those who would\nuse democracy to deny minority rights, to the nationalism that\nleft so many scars on this continent in the 20th century. But make no mistake:\nWhat we saw, what we are seeing in Tehran,\nin Tunis, in Tahrir Square, is a longing for the same\nfreedoms that we take for granted here at home. It was a rejection of the notion\nthat people in certain parts of the world don\'t want to be\nfree, or need to have democracy imposed upon them. It was a rebuke to the\nworldview of al Qaeda, which smothers the\nrights of individuals, and would thereby subject\nthem to perpetual poverty and violence. Let there be no doubt: The\nUnited States and United Kingdom stand squarely on the side of\nthose who long to be free. And now, we must show that\nwe will back up those words with deeds. That means investing in the\nfuture of those nations that transition to democracy,\nstarting with Tunisia and Egypt -- by deepening ties\nof trade and commerce; by helping them demonstrate\nthat freedom brings prosperity. And that means standing\nup for universal rights -- by sanctioning those\nwho pursue repression, strengthening civil\nsociety, supporting the rights of minorities. We do this knowing that the West\nmust overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the\nMiddle East and North Africa -- a mistrust that is\nrooted in a difficult past. For years, we\'ve faced charges\nof hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedoms\nthat they hear us espouse. And so to them, we must\nsquarely acknowledge that, yes, we have enduring interests in\nthe region -- to fight terror, sometimes with partners\nwho may not be perfect; to protect against disruptions\nof the world\'s energy supply. But we must also insist that\nwe reject as false the choice between our interests\nand our ideals; between stability and democracy. For our idealism is rooted in\nthe realities of history -- that repression offers only the\nfalse promise of stability, that societies are more\nsuccessful when their citizens are free, and that democracies\nare the closest allies we have. It is that truth that\nguides our action in Libya. It would have been easy at the\noutset of the crackdown in Libya to say that none of this was\nour business -- that a nation\'s sovereignty is more important\nthan the slaughter of civilians within its borders. That argument carries\nweight with some. But we are different. We embrace a broader responsibility. And while we cannot\nstop every injustice, there are circumstances that cut\nthrough our caution -- when a leader is threatening\nto massacre his people, and the international community\nis calling for action. That\'s why we stopped\na massacre in Libya. And we will not relent until the\npeople of Libya are protected and the shadow of\ntyranny is lifted. We will proceed with humility,\nand the knowledge that we cannot dictate every outcome abroad. Ultimately, freedom must be\nwon by the people themselves, not imposed from without. But we can and must stand\nwith those who so struggle. Because we have always believed\nthat the future of our children and grandchildren will be better\nif other people\'s children and grandchildren are more\nprosperous and more free -- from the beaches of Normandy\nto the Balkans to Benghazi. That is our interests\nand our ideals. And if we fail to meet\nthat responsibility, who would take our place,\nand what kind of world would we pass on? Our action -- our leadership\n-- is essential to the cause of human dignity. And so we must\nact -- and lead -- with confidence in our ideals,\nand an abiding faith in the character of our people,\nwho sent us all here today. For there is one final quality\nthat I believe makes the United States and the United\nKingdom indispensable to this moment in history. And that is how we define\nourselves as nations. Unlike most countries\nin the world, we do not define citizenship\nbased on race or ethnicity. Being American or British is not\nabout belonging to a certain group; it\'s about believing\nin a certain set of ideals -- the rights of individuals,\nthe rule of law. That is why we hold incredible\ndiversity within our borders. That\'s why there are people\naround the world right now who believe that if\nthey come to America, if they come to New York,\nif they come to London, if they work hard, they can\npledge allegiance to our flag and call themselves Americans;\nif they come to England, they can make a new life for\nthemselves and can sing God Save The Queen just\nlike any other citizen. Yes, our diversity\ncan lead to tension. And throughout our history there\nhave been heated debates about immigration and assimilation\nin both of our countries. But even as these\ndebates can be difficult, we fundamentally recognize that\nour patchwork heritage is an enormous strength -- that in\na world which will only grow smaller and more interconnected,\nthe example of our two nations says it is possible for people\nto be united by their ideals, instead of divided\nby their differences; that it\'s possible for hearts to\nchange and old hatreds to pass; that it\'s possible for the sons\nand daughters of former colonies to sit here as members\nof this great Parliament, and for the grandson of a Kenyan\nwho served as a cook in the British Army to stand\nbefore you as President of the United States. (applause) That is what defines us. That is why the young men and\nwomen in the streets of Damascus and Cairo still reach for the\nrights our citizens enjoy, even if they sometimes\ndiffer with our policies. As two of the most powerful\nnations in the history of the world, we must always remember\nthat the true source of our influence hasn\'t just been\nthe size of our economies, or the reach of our militaries,\nor the land that we\'ve claimed. It has been the values that we\nmust never waver in defending around the world -- the idea\nthat all beings are endowed by our Creator with certain\nrights that cannot be denied. That is what forged our bond\nin the fire of war -- a bond made manifest by the\nfriendship between two of our greatest leaders. Churchill and Roosevelt\nhad their differences. They were keen observers of\neach other\'s blind spots and shortcomings, if not\nalways their own, and they were hard-headed\nabout their ability to remake the world. But what joined the fates of\nthese two men at that particular moment in history was not simply\na shared interest in victory on the battlefield. It was a shared belief in the\nultimate triumph of human freedom and human dignity -- a\nconviction that we have a say in how this story ends. This conviction lives on\nin their people today. The challenges we\nface are great. The work before us is hard. But we have come through\na difficult decade, and whenever the tests and\ntrials ahead may seem too big or too many, let us\nturn to their example, and the words that Churchill\nspoke on the day that Europe was freed: ""In the\nlong years to come, not only will the people of this\nisland but...the world, wherever the bird of freedom\nchirps in the human heart, look back to what we\'ve done,\nand they will say \'do not despair, do not yield...\nmarch straightforward.\'"" With courage and purpose,\nwith humility and with hope, with faith in the\npromise of tomorrow, let us march\nstraightforward together, enduring allies in the cause of\na world that is more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just. Thank you very much. (applause) Speaker:\nMr. President, I think that\nresponse describes far more eloquently than any words of\nmine could do how much that very memorable and inspiring address\nwas appreciated by everybody who heard it here today. You spoke -- (applause) You spoke with great warmth\nand great generosity about the British Parliament and the\nBritish people and about the links that bind us, the\nvalues and the traditions that we share. The history that we have\nexperienced together. But more than that, you\nspoke too not just of the relationships of the past, but\nthe relationships of the future. And I think that was what made\nwhat you said so inspirational. It was a distinguished American\ngovernor of New York who remarked on the propensity of\npoliticians to campaign in poetry, but to govern in prose. The world you described to us\ntoday was not just one that is prosaic; it was one where the\nchallenges are difficult and sometimes dangerous. One that is fast\nmoving, that is complex, sometimes contradictory. And that offers at least as\nmany threats as opportunities. But in the eloquence\nof your address, you reminded us of the\nimportance of maintaining the poetry in government. Because to lead, that\npoetry is necessary. Necessary not only to\narticulate the challenges, as you did so masterfully. But also to bring others\ntogether to face those challenges with common\nprinciples and with shared purpose. Mr. President, it has been a\nprivilege for all of us to hear you speak today. It is a privilege for me to have\nthe responsibility of thanking you on behalf of both\nHouses of Parliament, for coming to Westminster, and\nto wish you and Mrs. Obama a very happy and pleasant\nrest of your stay in the United Kingdom. Thank you so much. (applause)']"
39,0,The lost neighborhood under New York's Central Park,"Before Central Park was built, a historically black community was destroyed. Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labIf you’ve been to New York, you’ve probably visited Central Park. But there’s a part of its story you won't see. It’s a story that goes back to the 1820s, when that part of New York was largely open countryside. Soon it became home to about 1,600 people. Among them was a predominantly black community that bought up affordable plots to build homes, churches and a school. It became known as Seneca Village. And when Irish and German immigrants moved in, it became a rare example at the time of an integrated neighborhood.Everything changed on July 21, 1853. New York took control of the land to create what would become the first major landscaped park in the US -- they called it “The Central Park.” In the Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present.

It’s an iconic part of New York City. A piece of nature, tucked inside Manhattan. If you’ve lived in New York, or even visited, you’ve probably been here. But, there’s a part of this land’s story that visitors will never see. It’s the story of what was here before the park. And the community that was destroyed to make way for it. In the 1820s, New York City looked like this. Most people lived in this area — Lower Manhattan. Pretty much everything above it, was yet to be settled. In this map, you can see how different the\ngeography was. These little lines illustrate what used to be hills in Manhattan. This was the countryside. Downtown was the opposite. Lower Manhattan was dense and crowded. A few small neighborhoods were home to many of the city’s poor whites, and immigrants. and also, to much of its black population. This document shows the number of slaves in New York State. You can see how it went down gradually, from 20,000 in 1800, to 10,000 in 1820, and finally to just 75 in 1830. That’s because in New York, slavery wasn’t abolished all at once. Instead, it was ended gradually over about 30 years. And as more free black people joined the work force, racial tensions rose. The people who were enslaved were now in competition\nwith people coming over for jobs. That tension led to violence — and lower Manhattan became increasingly dangerous for free black people. Then, in 1825, plots of land started to go up for sale here, uptown. It was a way out. A black man named Andrew Williams decided to buy three lots. You know word gets out, black people, seeing other black people and say oh there's a little bit of a community developing here, maybe we can just fold into this community, so they start to move in. After Williams, more lots filled up with black families and churches. And it was here, between 82nd and 89th Street, that the community of Seneca Village was born. Moving up to Seneca Village offered black families, an affordable, safe place. It also gave them the chance to vote. Black men could only vote in New York if they owned property. Over the course of the next three decades, the community grew to nearly 300 residents. Records from the census show that they were laborers, domestic workers, waiters, and shoemakers. And they built dozens of homes, three churches, and a school for black students. Later, when Irish and German immigrants started moving into Seneca Village, it became unique for another reason. It was an integrated community. It seems that people of all ethnicities were likely getting along based on the church records that were here. Among the documents, are evidence that some white and black families attended baptisms together, were buried next to each other in the same cemetery, and intermarried. The people who lived in this area were individuals who were trying to find a new way of life. Over the next three decades, the population of New York City nearly quadrupled. Lower Manhattan could no longer hold everyone. The city’s white elite were worried that the entire island would be consumed by development. They said it called for the necessity of a city park, to “give lungs to the city”. This came out of the elite being able to start to travel to Europe and they see the Champs Elysees and they see Kensington Park and they think that the city deserves to have a park of that stature. On July 21, 1853, New York set aside 750 acres of land to create America’s first major  landscaped public park. “The Central Park.” But the proposed area for the park included Seneca Village — along with thousands of  other lots of land, home to about 1600 people. In order to facilitate the park’s development, the city’s newspapers started to downplay who really lived there. They really describe these people as living in shanties and shacks, people of debased cultures were living off the land. But that wasn’t true. In 2011, Cynthia and a team of archaeologists excavated in the former Seneca Village site. They came away with 250 bags of objects to analyze, which now live here, in New York City’s Archaeological Repository. These objects suggest that Seneca Village was wealthier than many assumed. When we compared the objects from the homes of the people in the village with artifacts from Greenwich Village, an elite upper middle class neighborhood. In some cases, they were using the same kind of ironstone plate in what was called the Gothic pattern. Quite a few pieces of porcelain in Seneca Village and porcelain was an expensive ware. They also found other objects — like a comb, a smoking pipe, roasting pan, and part of a\xa0 toothbrush, that probably didn’t belong\nto poor people. Toothbrushes were not common among the working class as well as the middle class until around 1920. And the artifacts themselves were only one part of their analysis. For example, from the census records from 1855, we know that there was a very high level of education. Getting a high school education was clearly an important factor in the community and that’s very much a part of middle class identity. The findings indicate that Seneca Village wasn’t a shantytown. It was a working and middle class community, a growing neighborhood of black property owners, and an experiment in integration. But to the white New York elite of 1856, it wasn’t worth saving. A July 1856 article in the New York Times referred to it with a slur. “The Ebon inhabitants, after whom the village is called...have been notified to remove by the first of August.” Many residents fought to keep their land by filing objections to their forced removal. But Seneca Village — along with the other\nsettlements on the land for Central Park -- was seized and destroyed. In their place, the city made pathways,\nbuilt bridges and arches, and planted thousands of trees. Central Park was done, and Seneca Village was gone forever. We can't imagine New York City without Central Park. But I'm finally grateful that the recognition of the pre-park history has emerged. Today, New York is starting to reckon with this part of its history. An exhibition with information about Seneca Village is temporarily up in the park. But the real legacy of Seneca Village is a story that’s repeated itself again and again, in cities everywhere. Land, property ownership, That's how you get wealth and you pass wealth on from generation to generation. But you’re getting a bulldozer that comes\nthrough because a new highway has to come through or a new hospital or development site\nhas to come in. Seneca Village was no different. It's time that we own it and we come to recognize that there are these great stories that live beneath the surface of the park. It's not just African-American history. It's just American history.""]"

It’s time to require a background check\nfor anyone who wants to buy a gun. I’m one of the Republicans who does believe\nthere should be background checks. It is an open secret that the existing background\ncheck system is broken. Oh I have an appetite for background checks.\nWe’re going to be doing background checks. Here’s what they want to change: Right now,\ngun buyers in the US only have to go through a background check at a gun store. But they don’t have to go through one if\nthey buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer, like at a gun show or a private sale.\nBut with universal background checks, everyone who buys a gun would go through one. Pretty much every American is in favor of\nthis. There’s only one problem. Universal background\nchecks won’t solve America’s gun crisis. But there’s something else that might. To understand how background checks work,\nit helps to imagine two very different people, who both want to buy a gun. This first person is dangerous. Maybe he has\na history of domestic violence or mental illness. And most importantly — he has a record. And the second one is not dangerous. He just\nwants a gun for protection or to go hunting or cause shooting guns is kinda fun. Before either one can buy a gun, they first have to go through an FBI instant background check. And I mean instant — it only takes an average\nof 108 seconds to get a response from the FBI’s database. That database is made up of records sent in\nby state police and other agencies. And it’s checked to see if the buyer has things like\na criminal record, addiction, a restraining order or has been hospitalized for a mental\nillness. Under a universal background check system,\nanyone buying a gun — whether in a gun store, or through a private sale — would have to\nbe checked through that database. That means our second person walks out with a gun.\nAnd our first person, with a criminal record, doesn’t. Or, at least he shouldn’t. I’ve done a lot of reporting on this, we\nhave just seen time and time again background checks just do not stop people we don’t\nwant having guns from actually getting the weapons. There are a couple problems with the background\ncheck system. One is that the FBI database is about as outdated as its logo. It’s missing millions of records. That’s why the Charleston church shooter\nwas able to buy a gun, despite having a record. Or why the man who killed 26 Texan churchgoers\nwas also able to pass a background check, after the Air Force failed to send his domestic\nabuse convictions to the FBI. So even with a background check for every\ntype of sale, there’s still a chance this guy gets a gun. That’s partly why study after study has\nfound that while background checks “prevent, or make substantially more difficult, the\ncriminal acquisition of firearms.” Making them universal doesn’t actually have\nany effect on the actual gun crisis in America: gun deaths. A Johns Hopkins study of California, where\ncomprehensive background checks were implemented in 1991, found the law was “not associated\nwith changes in firearm suicide or homicide.” Thanks in part to those incomplete and missing\nrecords. The other problem is that background checks\nonly look at “good” people and “already bad” people. But there is an in between. The background checks are supposed to catch\npeople who have a record already. It just misses all the people who haven’t done anything\nbad yet but might do something bad in the future. German is not advocating for a Minority Report\nsituation. He’s talking about someone like this guy,\nwho is also dangerous, but who doesn’t have a record. Under a universal background check system\n— he could get a gun. In 108 seconds. But there’s another system that could prevent\nthis. Twelve states and Washington, DC have gone\none step further and established a licensing system. How’s it different? Well, Here’s how it\nworks in Massachusetts: Before you ever go to a gun store, you first\nhave to take a firearm safety course. Then you go to the police department and submit\nan application, give references and give your fingerprints for a background check. Then not only is the FBI database checked,\nbut all local law enforcement agencies wherever you’ve lived are directly contacted, along\nwith the Department of Mental Health. That entire process in Massachusetts usually\ntakes about 3 weeks. And most people‚ about 97% — pass. Nothing about a gun licensing system will\nprevent a law-abiding citizen from going through the process and obtaining a firearm. That’s Dr. Cassandra Crifasi, she researches\nhealth policy at Johns Hopkins, and she’s one of the authors of the studies earlier. And she says the reason licensing works is\nthat it’s designed to do both of the big things background checks fail at. A, to properly identify and screen out people\nwho shouldn’t have guns. And B, create a system to reduce impulsive\ngun purchases. The licensing system is more comprehensive\nthan the one-database background check system, so our criminal will be reliably denied a\ngun. But because it’s so meticulous it also stands\na chance of keeping our third guy, without a record, from getting a gun. There are people who, may want to impulsively\nacquire a firearm, for example to harm themselves or others. And the process of obtaining a license can\nat least delay that person during that time of crisis or maybe deter them from getting\nthat firearm at all. In 1995, Connecticut implemented a licensing\nsystem. Over the next 10 years, they saw a drop in\ngun homicides and gun suicides. Compare that to Missouri, which once had a\nlicensing system, but got rid of it in 2007. Over the next decade, they had a huge spike\nin homicides and gun suicides. In both states there were lots of factors\ninvolved. But researchers say this shows that licensing works. It’s also… pretty popular. Among voters\nwho live in a house with a gun, more than two-thirds think that it’s a good idea.\nAsk all Americans and more than three-quarters support it. Background checks are supposed to stop bad\npeople from getting guns. But they often don’t. Licensing picks up that slack. By making sure that people are crossing these hurdles,\nwe just make sure, in a much better, stronger way, that people are not getting firearms\nwhen they shouldn’t have them.']"
41,0,This photo triggered China's Cultural Revolution,"Mao Zedong swimming in a river in 1966 was a big deal.Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labIn 1966, Mao Zedong, China’s communist leader and the founder of the People’s Republic of China, was rumored to be in failing health. The devastating policies of his Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) — which forced millions of peasants to work tirelessly on government farming communes and by manufacturing crude steel — resulted in the greatest famine known to human history, costing anywhere between 23 and 55 million lives. Mao wanted to leave behind a powerful Communist legacy, like Marx and Lenin before him. And in order to do so, he needed to connect with the younger generation before he died. So after announcing his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he swam across the Yangtze River. Mao had done the same swim 10 years earlier to prove his vitality, and he hoped it would work again.His """"Cultural Revolution"""" was a call to hunt down and eliminate his enemies, and reeducate China’s youth with the principles Maoism. Led by the fanatical Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution was a devastating 10-year period in Chinese history that didn’t end until Mao died in 1976.Additional reading: Embodying Maoism: The swimming craze, the Mao cult, and body politics in Communist China, 1950s–1970s, by Shuk-wah Poon https://doi.org/10.1017/S0026749X1700...Red-Color News Soldier, by Li Zhenshenghttp://red-colornewssoldier.com/Darkroom is a history and photography series that anchors each episode around a single image.

The Chinese leader who had led a peasant army\nto victory in the Chinese Civil War, and established the communist People’s Republic of China\nin 1949, was getting old. Worse, his radical policies had devastated\nthe country, and triggered the deadliest famine known to human history. By the early 1960s, Mao’s once-great influence\nand public presence were at an all time low, and there were rumors that he was dying, or\neven dead already. He needed to find a way to seal his legacy\nas the face of Chinese communism. And a new revolution to lead. It started in a river. The Great Leap Forward was a disaster. It was Mao’s 1958 plan to quickly industrialize\nChina by working its massive peasant population nonstop. ARCHIVE: He promises to transform the People’s\nRepublic into an instant paradise through sheer force of numbers. Forcing workers in the countryside to farm\ncrops on government-run communes. And millions more to manufacture crude steel\nin homemade blast furnaces. And even though Mao told the world that the\nplan was succeeding… NARRATOR: Everywhere, the communists report,\nproduction records are being broken. … the truth was much more desperate. ARCHIVE: They flood the fields, exhaust the\nsoil, and farm production instead of going up, goes down. The Chinese people were being forced to work\ntirelessly on land they once owned themselves — and they were starting to lose morale. And despite reports of widespread famine,\nwith millions of people starving to death, Mao kept production quotas high. ARCHIVE: The pace grows more frantic. Ceaselessly, without rest, one observer writes. Mao's Great Leap Forward ended in 1962. By that time somewhere between 23 and 55 million\npeople had died in the famine. Over in the Soviet Union, a different political\nupheaval was happening. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who Mao modeled\nhimself after, was dead. And Mao watched as Nikita Krushchev, Stalin’s\nsuccessor, implemented a period known as “de-Stalinization.” Where Krushchev set out to reverse many of\nStalin’s policies and dismantle the personality cult that had formed around him. Mao saw his own legacy potentially suffering\nthe same fate. His Communist Revolution was long over, and\nhis ideas weren’t taken as seriously after the disaster of the Great Leap Forward. It was starting to look like Mao’s place\nin the pantheon of powerful communist figures, like Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, was in\nperil. This is where the river comes in. Mao had a reputation for being a strong swimmer. And even used it as a symbol of his ideology. In 1956, he swam across China’s biggest\nriver, the Yangtze, in three highly-publicized swims. To demonstrate that big things – like US\nimperialism – didn’t intimidate him. 10 years later, Mao took on the Yangtze again,\nto dispel rumors of his failing health. This time with cheering crowds swimming alongside\nhim. He brought his personal photographer, who\nsnapped this photo of the aging dictator in the river. And another one showing Mao waving to his\nfellow swimmers, with the landmark Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge behind him. An iconic architectural achievement of the\ncommunist government, and proof that he was at the Yangtze. The swim made the front page of China’s\nstate newspaper, reporting that Mao swam around 15 kilometers, a little more than 9 miles,\nin a span of 65 minutes. Which meant the 72-year-old would have shattered\nworld speed records. A lot of people outside of China laughed at\nthe outlandish story, but some saw the swim for what it was: a sinister sign. Pointing out that Mao’s swims from a decade\nearlier preceded the catastrophic Great Leap Forward. Experts feared that Mao was on the verge of\nkicking off another disastrous period of turmoil in China. They were right. Two months before the swim, Mao had announced\nthe beginning of his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A call to hunt down and eliminate the “bourgeoisie\nwho [had] sneaked into the party.” Basically to purge the government of anyone\nwho strayed from principles of Maoism. And it kicked into high gear after his historic\nswim. Which prompted a craze for swimming in swept\nChina, but more importantly, a craze for Mao. Especially among the group that Mao wanted\nto influence the most: China’s youth. Writer Liang Heng recalled that seeing Mao\nas “human flesh and blood” after the Yangtze swim resolved him to “serve him with all\nhis heart.” Millions of Chinese youth organized into the\nfanatical Red Guards, a paramilitary force concentrated mostly in Chinese cities. And, with Mao’s blessing, they wreaked havoc\nin the name of Cultural Revolution. Their mission was to destroy the four olds: ARCHIVE: Old culture. Old ideology. Old customs. Old traditions. The idea was basically to tear down the vestiges\nof Imperial China and rewrite history centered around Mao Zedong. Renaming buildings and streets, destroying\ncultural sites, and violently humiliating, and often torturing and murdering, anyone\nthey accused of opposing Mao’s ideas. Which they plastered all over the cities. And carried in their pockets in the form of\nMao’s “Little Red Book” a collection of his sayings and principles. And although the violent Red Guards were basically\ndissolved by 1969, the Cultural Revolution is considered to have continued until Mao’s\ndeath in 1976. Ending a decade of destruction that had elevated\nthe leader to god-like levels. And resulted in over 1 million people dead. The chaos of the Cultural Revolution scarred\nChina for generations. But Mao basically got what he wanted. Even though the Chinese Communist Party condemned\nthe Cultural Revolution in 1981, and Chinese communism diverted away from Maoism, they\ndidn’t denounce Mao himself. The Cultural Revolution solidified Mao’s\ncult of personality, and that influence has lasted. Mao’s swim, which is still commemorated\neach year in China, was more than a display of strength. It was a message: to get behind Mao as he\nbegan his last revolution.""]"
42,0,We measured pop music’s falsetto obsession,"From Justin Timberlake to the Bee Gees, we charted the popularity of men singing high.Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labIt’s nearly impossible to turn on the radio and not hear a male artist singing really high. Likely he’s a tenor, and more often than not he’ll sing in falsetto. Think Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Drake, Charlie Puth, Shawn Mendes, Adam Levine, Sam Smith ... the list goes on and on and on. This isn’t a trend — it has been the status quo for decades. Using the data diving know-how of The Pudding, and drawing on the expertise of Anthony Roth Costanzo, a professional opera singer, I dig into the world of the high male vocal range by tracking how pervasive it really is across the decades.

This one hasn’t either nor has this one. None of these have. That because I made them, along with Matt\nhere. My name is Matt Daniels and I'm a journalist\nat the Pudding, which is a publication for visually led storytelling. Well, mainly Matt made them, I just sent him\na bunch of emails. These charts are the result of a year long\nobsession I’ve had over a very specific trend I’ve noticed in music. Men singing really high. When I listen to the radio, I’ve come to\nexpect one thing. Male pop stars exploiting their upper register. Bruno Mars, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Charlie\nPuth, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Adam Lavine, the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, Khalid,\nChildish Gambino, Frank Ocean, all of One Direction, BTS, Chris Martin, One Republic,\nand Sam Smith. I’m not the first person to pick up on this. In 2015 alone it seemed every guy was singing\nhigh. There was Jason Derulo “Just the thought of you, gets me so high\n(so high)” Maroon 5 “I’m right here, cause I need a little\nlove a little sympathy” And Justin Bieber “Yeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?” But maybe this fact is best illustrated by\nthis 10 week period on the Billboard Charts. When The Weekend battled for the top spot\nagainst Justin Bieber “And I know she'll be the death of me” “What do you mean?” And then Himself “I only call you when it's half past five” until finally his Michael Jackson inspired\nvoice was was dethroned by Adele’s “Hello.” “Hello, It’s Me” Really the only way to know if this hypothesis\nholds up, though, is to crunch the numbers and quantify it. And that’s where Matt came in. It kind of fits a really good mold of the\nquestions that I really like, where we have a cultural question about vocal ranges and\nusage of falsetto and music and there is no perfect data set for that. We wanted to make a chart that showed how\nprevalent the male falsetto was in pop music, not just in the last 5 years, but as far back\nas we could go. That meant looking at music streaming services. Every streaming platform tags the millions\nof songs in their respective libraries with metadata, but each one does it a little differently. For example, Spotify has over 35 millions\nsongs in their library, but their metadata is algorithmically driven and pretty broad. Matt: some of it was around the tempo of music\nand how danceable it was or its somber or positive tone. Pandora, on the other hand has a smaller library,\nbut they are committed to very specific data. In their case it wasn’t algorithmically\ndriven. They were actually having humans review songs\nand say what its DNA, or what its genome was. The result is a library of 2 million songs\nwith up to 450 individual identifying markers. So that was interesting to me because falsetto\nand vocal range, while could be determined by a computer, often lends itself to the human\near because there is some subjectivity to it. So, we asked Pandora if they had vocal data. They did. And they shared it with us. So do you actually have available the original\ndataset that we received? Oh yeah yeah I can. Should I just bring that up? It's forty two thousand rows. The first entry is by George P. Watson from\n1911 He was a Yodeler. One hundred and eight years later and 42,948\nrows down we have the iconic high voice of Thom Yorke. Sudden words We’ll get to exactly how these are scored\nin a bit, but damn that’s a lot of songs. So what we said was “OK this is great to\nsee these forty three thousand songs but really we only care about songs that charted.” So we created a data set of the Billboard\nHot 100, a 28,000 song list of the 100 most popular songs in the US every week since 1958. and we went back to Pandora. And said we only really want the falsetto\ndata for these songs, and not only do we want the falsetto data, but we also\nneed data about the register. And a few other important things, like the\ngender of the person singing. It’s not just a matter of like putting\ninto their system and it spits out the falsetto data. We need to match the names of the songs and\nthe artists names to whatever Pandora has. Wait. So you have to do that manually? We write fancy programs to guess that there's\na match and confirm that there's a match. So with Matt’s fancy program we matched\n20,075 songs. So the biggest gap in the data is actually\nthe missing songs that aren't on streaming services, but were on the Billboard Hot 100\nand did have very valid falsetto data behind them. So in 1958 we have data for 50% of the songs\nthat charted. In 2018 we have data for 95% of the songs\nthat charted. The good thing though is, you think of an\naverage number one hit from 1958 - that's more likely to appear on Pandora than a song\nthat hit number 100 for one week. When I first sat down with this giant spreadsheet,\nI immediately wanted to see how songs that I thought had a lot of falsetto had actually\nbeen scored. The first song that I looked for was Childish\nGambino’s “Redbone.” “If you want it, you can have it, ohhhhhh” His voice is super high and very memorable. Not only that, a lot of articles about this\nsong mentioned it had a lot of falsetto. To my astonishment, Pandora determined there\nwas no falsetto in the song, instead they said it was just sung in a high register This trend was most stark in the hard rock\nand heavy metal genres. Def Leppard’s “Rock of Ages” had a falsetto\nscore of zero but register score of 9 out of 10. I don't care if it takes all night\nI gonna set this town alight, come on Knowing this, let’s define what falsetto\nand vocal register actually are. To do that I’ve brought in an actual opera\nsinger. Hi I'm Anthony Roth Costanzo and I'm a countertenor\nand opera singer. Prove it. Perfect, let’s talk about vocal range first. The voices starting from the bottom in the\nclassical tradition are bass, baritone, tenor, contralto, countertenor, mezzo soprano, Soprano. Countertenor is kind of a catch all term and\nit's a range that goes up and down. Most male pop stars today are tenors. That means their average range is somewhere\nbetween here and here. Pandora’s data scores vocal register - which\nmeasures a singers ability to go up and down their range consistently. A super high register Pandora rates songs from 0-10 from low to\nhigh. “Rock of Ages” ranked super high with\na 9 - Pharrell’s voice in “Get Lucky” was\ngiven an 8 “I’m up all night to get some, she’s\nup all night for good fun, I’m up all night to get lucky” As was Elton John in “Crocodile Rock” “I never knew me a better time and I guess\nI never will” So I think it's safe to say that between a\n7 and 8 is pretty high on the vocal register range. But it's not crazy. So when these artists want to access even\nhigher notes they’ll likely switch to their falsetto register. Falsetto is an Italian word which means “false\nlittle voice.” Falsetto is typically a technique ascribed\nto a male singer that switches from their chest voice to their head voice. Whenever you're going from chest voice - meaning\nthe speaking register - to head voice, there's often a little break because there are two\ndifferent sets of muscles handing off to each other, and that's how you yodel right. [demonstrates yodeling] And that's what yodeling\nis. George, you’re back! It’s not just Yodeling. It happens in pop all the time, though that\ntransition is often more invisible. Notice how Freddie Mercury goes from his chest\nvoice to falsetto when he says the word “decline” “A built-in remedy\nFor Kruschev and Kennedy At anytime an invitation\nYou can't decline” Okay so let me just pause for a second and\nsay that “falsetto,” as a term, has been around forever, but its definition has changed and\nevolved. Many vocal coaches would say that falsetto\nis that breathy, light sound you heard from Freddie Mercury. And they say the generic term “head voice”\nshould describe crisper, reinforced high notes. A perfect example of that is from this 90s\nclassic. “I knew I loved you before I met you. I knew I loved you.” That's amazing. I mean you know that's like a really well\nintegrated instrument. For your average music listener, aka me, the\ntechnical distinction between head voice and falsetto is less important than the fact that\nthey both just sound impossibly high. That brings us again to the scoring system. A 10 on the Pandora scale is a song that’s\nsung entirely in Falsetto “Staying alive” That’s pretty extreme, and according to our data set, it’s also pretty\nrare. So here’s the tricky determination I’ve\ngot to make. What falsetto score is enough to really define\na song. I think a good place to start is a song literally\ncalled “Falsetto” “Now I got her talking like this, in a falsetto. She’s like oooh oooh baby ahh ah ah” Pandora gave this song a 6 - in their ears,\nThe-Dream only used the technique moderately. This is where I could split hairs all day. Because while, yeah, The-Dream doesn’t use\na falsetto the whole time, the technique plays does play a central role in the track. The hook of the song, the most memorable part,\nis sung in falsetto. Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River”\nalso got a 6. “Cry me a river (go on and just)\nCry me a river (go on and just) Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)” So, I’m going to look at songs with a falsetto\nabove a 5 If there’s one thing I can’t stress enough,\nit’s that this data can be addressed in a 1,000 different ways. To keep things simple, though we’ve separated\nfalsetto and vocal register as two separate data points. I think this is probably the first chart I\nmade that just was super simple and just said all right “What is the average value of\nall the songs that charted in a year.” First let's focus on vocal register. I was not expecting to see this just a very\nclear like march to the top in the late 80s The average vocal register for male singer\nin 1988 was a 7.1. But as you can see across any time period,\nthat average never really dropped below 5.4. Because there were so many songs in 1988 that\nhad a register of 7 or higher, we’re going to make this a little bit tougher. I’m going to boost the register to an 8\nand only allow songs that made it in the top 10. We’ve got a strong hard rock and heavy metal\nshowing. “She's got a smile it seems to me” There’s my man Phil Collins “I'm always right there beside her\nWe're two hearts” I’ve literally never heard this song “I can rocket 2 u” Okay, wow. If we push the Falsetto score up to a 6, we’re\nleft with just two songs from 1988. “Smooth Criminal”\n“He came into her apartment He left the bloodstains on the carpet” and “Nite and Day” by Al B Sure! “I can tell you how I feel about you night\nand day” With Nite and Day just barely edging out to\nwin. The 1980s blew a high male vocal register\nout of the water. So let’s see how this chart changes when\nwe just focus on falsetto. Things start to shift going back from the\n1980s to the 1970s - the disco era. 1975 was the highest year for falsetto. Where 18% of songs had a value over 4. It also serves as a turning point for the\nBee Gees. This might be surprising to hear, but before\n1975 the Bee Gees’s average falsetto was around 0.8. After 1975 it rose to a 5.5. And that makes sense. They had to compete with the likes of Earth,\nWind, and Fire, Ohio Players, Eddie Kendricks, Curtis Mayfield - all artists whose careers\nwere defined by their high voices. I can imagine a record executive in a room\nlistening to a song and they're like “Yeah that's great but you should put some falsetto\nin there somewhere” It wasn’t until 1976 that their now trademark\nfalsetto hit number one. “You should be dancing, yeah” Looking back at both of these charts, it’s\nobvious something shifted after the 1980s. The thing that changed after the 80s is you\nhave hip hop becoming massively popular. And today it's the most popular genre. If you look at the average song there just\nisn't as many opportunities for for a falsetto because there's just less singing. So how do we account for that? So I created this toggle that basically said\nis there singing in this song which is also from the Pandora data, they basically have\na spoken variable. So first let’s see what happens when we\ntoggle the singing function for songs in the top 10. 1996 and 2015 really shoot up. Let’s focus on 1996 first. This was the year Neo-Seoul went mainstream. Artists like D’Angelo and Maxwell led the\ncharge. Their voices were a modern twist on the soul\nartists of the 1970s. I mean just listen to D’Angelo next to Curtis\nMayfield. “When I first saw you baby\nI wanted to die Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine” “So In Love, every time we kiss” 2\n1996 was a huge year for Falsetto, but so was 2015. And here are maybe your your your ears hearing\nthe right thing, relative to other years, 2015 was the year of high voices. Regardless of which toggle we select or which\ncombination of falsetto and register we choose, we did find this: if a song has falsetto,\nwhether it’s a 1 or a 10, it’s going to chart higher — and longer. This is true across nearly every year. Not only that, Top 10 Hits are more likely\nto use falsetto. Take a look at that huge spike in 2015. 66% of songs that peaked in the top 10 had\nfalsetto. Regardless of the decade, high male voices\nare iconic. From the Frankie Vallie belting Sherry “Sherry baby” To the 70s swagger of Bloodstone’s “Natural\nHigh” “I'm trying to make something out of nothing\nAnd I don't even know you” To the Weeknd’s hazy R&B “None of these toys on lease too, ah\nMade your whole year in a week too, yah” It feels like today is very good for the commercial\nviability of the high male voice. And I think that's true if the window of time is the millennials' lifetime. But if you were to talk to your parents or\nyour parents parents they'd be like Oh you think today is good. In nineteen seventy five it's not even comparable. The reason why it might feel like a trend\ntoday is because this is all we've ever known.""]"
43,0,"The massacre of Tulsa's """"Black Wall Street""""","White mobs destroyed """"Black Wall Street"""" in 1921. But where are the victims' bodies?Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labNearly 100 years ago, a white mob destroyed an American neighborhood called “Black Wall Street,” murdering an estimated 300 people in Tulsa, Oklahoma. That incident — known as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre — has been largely left out of US history books. Today, a century later, the city still has a lot of questions. For one, where are the bodies of the victims? As the city's mayor re-opens the search for mass graves, we take a look at what happened back in 1921…and why finding these graves still matters to the people of Tulsa.

And for decades, people didn’t talk about\nit. “I was an adult before I ever heard about\nit. It was something that was hidden.” “This entire historic community was obliterated.” “Bodies dumped in rivers bodies dumped in\nmass graves. It was an absolute massacre.” This story isn’t one you’ll find in most\nhistory books. And almost 100 years later, the facts of what\nexactly happened that day...are still unraveling. “So we’re driving in what’s known as\nBlack Wall Street. It’s where one of the nation’s worst episodes\nof racial violence took place.” In 1921 — a neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma\ncalled the Greenwood District, was a bustling community of black-owned businesses. Tulsa locals know that period of Greenwood’s\nhistory as a kind of Golden Age. “If you can imagine just like an old time\ndowntown, things like movie theaters, pharmacy\'s, hair salons, and so forth.” They called it, “Black Wall Street”. “It was a mecca, it was a huge success.” But Black Wall Street was also an anomaly. It thrived at a time when the KKK was incredibly\nactive in Oklahoma and the nation had just been through the “Red Summer of 1919”\n— when white mobs murdered black people in dozens of incidents across the US. “There needed to be a sort of match or an\nigniter tossed on these embers and that event was, that trigger event, was an incident that\ninvolved two teenagers: Dick Rowland, 19-year-old black boy who shined shoes downtown. Sarah Page, 17-year-old white girl who ran\nan elevator in a downtown building called the Drexel Building. He went to the building boarded the elevator. Something happened. Sarah Page began to scream. They both ran out of the elevator.” Now we don’t know exactly what happened\nin this elevator — but a day later, Rowland was arrested and taken to the courthouse. The local newspaper ran an article claiming\nRowland had assaulted Page. Even though Page refused to press charges, the\narticle was essentially a call to action for whites. “A large white mob began to gather on the\nlawn of the courthouse. Dick Rowland was in jail on the top floor. A number of black men, several dozen, marched\ndown to the courthouse to protect him. Some of them armed. There was a struggle between one of the black\nmen in the small group and one of the white men in a larger group. And things sort of went south from from that\npoint.” Hundreds of white people descended upon Black\nWall Street, armed. Black residents withdrew behind the railroad\ntracks that marked off the Greenwood district. Some of them were armed, and fought back. But they were outnumbered by the white mob, which\nshot their way through. The white mob murdered. They looted. And they set fire to Black Wall Street. “This was the strategy, if you will, of\nhow to deal with these successful black communities. The effects were disastrous.” For two days, the Greenwood district burned. Martial law was declared. And the National Guard was brought in. By the time the massacre ended, Greenwood\nwas in ruins. More than 1200 homes were destroyed, and 35\nblocks, burned. The exact number of casualties is harder to\npin down. Some initially only reported that white people\ndied. Others, reported somewhere between 30 and\n100 mostly black casualties. But estimates now put that number closer to\n300. As for those that survived, thousands of them\nlived in tents cities in the months that followed...and were left to pick up the pieces of rubble\nthey once called home. After the massacre, the cover up started. Records went missing from city files — including\nthe very article that started it all. It makes photos from this time all the more\nimportant as part of the historical record. But back in 1921, these images served a very\ndifferent purpose. “So photo postcards like these were widely\ndistributed after the massacre. At the time they were a part of white supremacist\nculture, and kept as souvenirs of racially charged crimes.” Now, they’re preserved to make sure this\npart of Tulsa’s history isn’t forgotten — and they paint a clear picture of how\nmuch destruction there was that day. On the postcards, it’s called “The Tulsa\nRace Riot” — a name that, itself, sort of erases what really happened. “By calling it a riot, \xa0it\'s a way of trying\nto rewrite the history, assuming that there were both sides at fault and that was not\nthe case. I call it a massacre and I call it that, because that’s what\nit was.” Greenwood eventually rebuilt. But nearly a century later, there’s a part\nof this story that still haunts the city. No one actually knows where the victims’\nbodies are. “We’ve got to find our people we\'ve got\nto put them at rest. If not we continue to be haunted by what was\ndone so many years ago.” Kavin Ross, a local writer, is one of many\nin Tulsa, descended from people who lost everything in the massacre. “So in this cemetery there are only two\nofficial victims of the Tulsa race massacre. How many victims do you think there are?” “After all these years, I think 300 is putting\nit mild.” In 1997, the city finally put together a commission\nto study the massacre, and help piece together what happened in 1921. They compiled records, and eyewitness accounts. “The bullets were just raining down over\nus.” “They set our house on fire and went right\nstraight to the curtains and set the curtains on fire.” These accounts are especially important now\n— because none of these survivors are alive anymore. And they also provided new information. Some mentioned trucks - like this one - loaded\nwith victims of the riot. One riot witness in particular came forth, testifying that he saw bodies being dumped in Oaklawn Cemetery. “This is it. This is the area.” Using the survivor accounts, records, and\neventually, radar — \xa0the city was able to pinpoint three locations with anomalies\nin the soil. Only one step was left, to excavate. But it was something the city, at the time,\nwasn’t up for doing. For many Tulsans, it was a part of history\nbest forgotten, and not worth investigating. In some ways, today, that sentiment remains. “Kind of a waste of money."" ""Why do you think that?"" ""It’s over. It\'s done with."" But there are clear signs of a city that’s\nready to come to terms with a dark chapter in its history. “Honestly that’s a lot of missing people,\npeople that probably had families.” “We owe it to the people who whose blood\nhas actually fertilized the grounds of this place.” “There was a tremendous amount of racism” “Injustice plus time does not equal justice.” Today, a new mayor is re-opening the investigation. “I think a pretty basic compact that a city\nmakes with its citizens is, if somebody murders you we will do everything we can to find out\nwhat happened to you and give your family closure. Whether you were murdered yesterday or you\nwere murdered 98 years ago.” The city will be looking into the three areas\nthat the commission noted. That process — of \xa0finding out what lies\nbeneath Tulsa — and DNA matching any remains with descendants, could take years. The investigation is just one part of a bigger\nhistorical reckoning. But the reality is, it can\'t undo the crimes or the cover up\nof the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. “This story is the greatest conspiracy of\nsilence that I\'ve ever seen in history.” “Thanks for watching.

It has been ranked as the least affordable housing market on Earth for eight years in a row, and the price per square foot seems to be only going up. The inflated prices are forcing Hongkongers to squeeze into unconventionally small spaces that can affect their quality of life. Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are living in spaces that range from 75 to 140 square feet. To put that in perspective, the average parking space in the US is about 150 square feet. And in the most extreme cases, Hongkongers have resorted to homes the size of a coffin.

Hong Kong has been ranked the least affordable housing\nmarket in the world eight years in a row and by a long shot. Housing prices are now almost 20 times more than annual income. That means that\na household making $50,000 USD would on average be looking for\na house that cost $980,000 USD. And it's getting really bad. Hundreds of thousands of residents now squeeze into incredibly\nsmall apartments, most of them no bigger than a parking space. So these are cage\nhomes, which basically fit one person and their belongings. And they basically\nstack these in a room in order to fit as many people as they can in the room.\nAnd yet the price per square foot for these smaller houses just keeps shooting\nup. I visited these homes to try to piece together an explanation for this trend\nand to meet the people who are being squeezed by the world's least affordable\nreal estate market. There are now tens of thousands of\npeople in this city who live in spaces that are between 75 and 140 square feet.\nFor some perspective a typical parking space in the US is 120 square feet. One of the most common strategies for small space living is this subdivided house model. This big space that's been divided up into a bunch of tiny little\nliving spaces. These people basically have room for a bed and a table and a\nfew belongings. What makes this model work is that they have a bigger\ncommunal space where they're able to have their cooking and their washing and\nthe bathroom open to everyone, so that they can save space and save money in\ntheir actual living quarters. So this is the kitchen for this space which is\nshared by four families. The tempting\nexplanation here for why the prices are so high is land scarcity. You know, seven and a half million people crammed into this series of islands, it's gonna drive up\nthe prices. The same story in a lot of places that have run out of land that\nare in high demand — in San Francisco or New York City. Okay this might be the\nstory in New York City and San Francisco, but is Hong Kong actually running out of\nland? Let's see what the drone says about this. Flying over Hong Kong you start to\nsee that, while yes, there's a very dense urban landscape, there's also a whole lot\nof green space. Government land-use data says that 75 percent of the land in Hong\nKong is not developed. Now some of that is mountainous and rocky and not easy to\nbuild on, but certainly not all of it. So I posed this question about density\nto two experts, one is a Hong Kong citizen and the other is a 30-plus year\nresident. Both are advocates for better urban design. Are high prices primarily\nthe result of land scarcity? No. No. There's a land-use issue, because also\nland is being inefficiently used or conserved. The problem isn't the shortage\nof land the problem is bad land management. Land use, land management, what\nthese experts are referring to is that of all the land in Hong Kong only 3.7% is zoned for urban housing. But it's not because of\nmountains, it's because of policy and this gets to the heart of the\nexplanation of why more and more people are living in homes the size of parking\nspaces. The first thing to note if you want to understand the real explanation,\nis that the government owns all of the land in Hong Kong. Well, all except for\nthis one church that the British built here when they ruled it back in the 1800s\nand it kind of just escaped the whole government-owns-all-the-land thing. So the government owns all the land and it leases it out to developers, usually for\n50 years in an auction process where the highest bidder gets the contract. With\nsuch scarce and valuable land zoned for housing, real estate companies more and\nmore of them coming from mainland China with lots of money, will duke it out in\nthese auctions. And will end up at an astronomically high price. Like this plot of land that was just leased out for 2.2 billion dollars, which\nset an all-time record for the most expensive land of ever leased by the Hong\nKong government to a developer. So the way the government zones and leases\nland is the first part of this. The other part of this explanation has a lot to do\nwith taxes. If you're the type of person who navigates away from this video when\nyou hear the word tax policy, stay with me here. This place loves low\ntaxes. It's a great place to do business, because the corporate tax is low\nno value-added tax, no sales tax, free market economics, low taxes. That's\nembedded into the fabric of this place. Look at all those low taxes doing their\nwork, building up those skyscrapers, slapping on those bank logos all over\ntown. So if the government isn't getting revenue from taxes, it really needs it from\nanother source and in the case of Hong Kong that source is land sales. A lot of the government revenues here driven by land revenues and it's about 30% of government public financing income. The government of Hong Kong can\nlease out this land to developers at astronomical prices, make a ton of\nrevenue from that and not have to raise taxes on the people or the corporations\nthat reside here and they still proudly retain their ranking\nas the freest economy on earth. What this means is that the Hong Kong government\ndoesn't have a huge incentive to free up more land and lower prices, but while\nthis current arrangement of bidding and auctions is really good for revenue for\nthe government and good for the market generally, it's not super good for the\npeople of Hong Kong. Of all the small spaces, this is easily the most cramped. These are\ncoffin homes. Could I ask you just a quick question about your living space? The government is slowly working on this\nproblem. Year after year new policies come in\nthat are meant to fix this, but they're slow to change, mainly because they have\nan incentive to keep the status quo as it is. Out here at this industrial\ncomplex in Hong Kong, I met with a guy named Eric Wong, a local inventor and\nbusinessman who has seen a business opportunity in the midst of this space\ncrisis. Eric grew up in Hong Kong and has been\nthinking about small-space living for a long time. Oh it has WiFi. These capsules come in one or two-person sizes and are meant to provide a more\nefficient and hygienic version of the cage and coffin homes, all at a\nrelatively low price. Down here there's a little box where you can put all your\nvaluables and so there's mirror lights, there's reading lights. But these capsules,\ninnovative as they are, really just put a band-aid on this housing problem.\nThey don't serve as a real solution. A real solution would need to come from\nsomething that's much less profitable and fun to look at: Government policy and\nzoning reform that will free up more land and put the interests of the people\nabove the interests of the market, but until the government can make that\nhappen people in Hong Kong will continue to squeeze into smaller and smaller\nspaces.""]"

In 1912, he reached the Pole only to learn that his Norwegian rival, Roald Amundsen, had beat him to it. Caught by freakish weather and a string of bad luck, his entire party died trying to get back. Reasons for his failure range from his use of ponies rather than dogs to a highly unusual temperature drop that made the journey back impossible to survive.Darkroom is a new series from Vox producer Coleman Lowndes that digs into stories of the past, one photograph at a time.

These are British explorers standing at the\nSouth Pole in January 1912. The photo marks the finish line of a race\ninto the unknown. Two teams, one British, one Norwegian, trekked\n900 miles into brutal territory and had to get back to safety before winter hit. And at first glance, this looks like a victory\nphoto for the British. Except that is the Norwegian flag. And it only gets worse from here. Robert Falcon Scott was a meticulous planner. And his dream was to be the first person to\nreach the South Pole. He and his English team of explorers and scientists\nhad been conducting research in Antarctica and collected years of data on seasonal cycles\non the continent. These lines show what they estimated average\ntemperatures would be throughout the year, with summer ranging from around 30 to negative\n10 degrees Fahrenheit, and huge drops beginning around April. Remember this chart because later, it will\nhelp us understand Scott’s decision-making. Scott planned to use pony transport for the\nfirst 425 miles across the Ross Ice Shelf, shoot them at the base of the Beardmore Glacier,\nand finish the rest of the journey on foot. Which included a 125-mile hike across the\ntop of the glacier, 350 more miles to the pole, and all the way back again, all while\nhauling hundreds of pounds of equipment. Using ponies and brute strength made sense\nto Scott at the time: British explorers had used this method to\nhaul equipment during an earlier attempt on the South Pole. Plus, the English didn’t have experience\nwith the other good option: dog teams. And they believed man-hauling was the surest\nway to make the tricky climb up the glacier and on to the Polar Plateau, where the South\nPole sits. It was hard, slow work, but the route they\nwere on had reached the plateau before, and it seemed to be worth the effort. But Scott’s team wasn’t alone. Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was camped\nnearby. And he wanted to get to the pole first. The Norwegian team, all of them expert skiers,\nknew how to travel in cold conditions. And to make matters worse for the English,\nAmundsen had dogs — and he knew how to use them. News of the Norwegians’ last-minute bid\nworried Scott, but he was still optimistic. Amundsen had started about 60 miles closer\nto the pole but was taking a route not yet proven to be passable. Coming against an unknown obstacle or falling into an unmarked crevasse could end his attempt prematurely. But that’s not how it happened. By the time Scott reached his goal, Amundsen’s\nflag was there waiting for him. The Norwegians and their dogs had comfortably\nreached the pole five weeks earlier and were almost back to their starting point\nby the time the English arrived. Scott and his team were heartbroken. They took this photo outside of Amundsen’s\ntent the day they started their long journey back. Scott wrote: Left a note to say I had visited the tent\nwith companions. Bowers photographing and Wilson sketching. We have turned our back now on the goal of\nour ambition and must face our 800 miles of solid dragging — and good-bye to most of\nthe daydreams! This is where the trouble really begins. It’s mid-January in this photo — still the height of the Antarctic summer. Told you this chart was coming back. According to their research, the team had\nabout 3 months left before temperatures on the Ross Ice Shelf, the last leg of the journey\nback, would drop to deadly levels. That left plenty of time to make the long\ntrek on foot. But this isn’t what happened in 1912. This is that average line again, and these\nare the temperatures Scott’s party endured that summer: consecutive days of temperatures\naround minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Those conditions, at prolonged exposure, are\nnot survivable. The first man died here — he collapsed and\nsoon went comatose following several falls on the glacier. The next man died about a month later, after\ncrippling frostbite in his hands and feet began hurting the team’s progress and their\nchances of survival. Nearly unable to walk, he left the tent and\nsacrificed himself to a snowstorm. The last three, including Scott, made it here\nbefore getting trapped in their tent by a blizzard, just 11 miles from the supply depot that would\nhave saved their lives. The tent, along with the bodies, journals,\nand photographs, was found 8 months later by a search team. As time went on, Scott’s legacy vacillated\nbetween fearless explorer and bumbling fool who tried to take ponies into the Antarctic. But the thing is his plan should have worked. Measurements from modern weather stations\nalong his route show the predictions he was relying on were impressively accurate. What Scott couldn’t have known is that 1912\nwas an anomaly — the temperatures his party suffered through occur roughly once every\n15 years, turning an already risky venture into a hopeless one. The photo they took outside of Amundsen’s\ntent was meant to be a gentlemanly admission of defeat at the end of a long race. But instead, it was the starting line of a\nrace they didn't see coming — a desperate attempt to escape from the coldest place on\nEarth.

46,0,These photos ended child labor in the US,"Child labor was widely practiced until a photographer showed the public what it looked like.This video is presented by CuriosityStream: https://www.curiositystream.com/VoxBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labThe 1900 US Federal Census revealed that 1.75 million children under the age of 16, more than one in five, were gainfully employed. They worked all over the country in cotton mills, glass blowing factories, sardine canneries, farms, and even coal mines. In an effort to expose this exploitation of children, the National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to travel around the country and investigate and report on the labor conditions of children. Lewis Wickes Hine photographed and interviewed kids, some as young as 4 years old, and published his findings in various Progressive magazines and newspapers. Once the public saw the plight of these children, state legislatures were pressured to pass bills regulating labor for workers under the age of 18, effectively bringing an end to child labor in the United States.

Operating heavy machinery that’s nearly\ntwice her height in a cotton mill in Lancaster, South Carolina, in 1908. She was just one of many children working\nin mills, fields, factories, and mines. And although these kids were spread across\nthe United States, working in separate industries, they all had one thing in common: They all met Lewis Hine. At the turn of the 20th century, the United\nStates knew it had a child labor problem. The 1900 federal census revealed that 1.75\nmillion children under the age of 16, more than one in five, were working at this time. The Industrial Revolution had mechanized American\nand European manufacturing, and a cheap labor force was needed to complete repetitive tasks\nfor hours on end. Children from poor families were targeted\nfor these jobs because they would work for next to nothing and were less likely to strike\nthan adults. State legislatures and the American public\nknew this was happening on a mass scale, but didn’t act. Until they saw what it actually looked like. Starting in 1908, the newly formed National\nChild Labor Committee hired a photographer to investigate and report on the industries\nemploying children. That photographer was Lewis Wickes Hine: educator,\nsociologist, and member of the Progressive Movement. A period in the United States that saw a wave\nof political activism and social reform. Hine emphasized the potential power of photography\nas a tool for social reform in a speech he gave in 1909 called “Social photography:\nhow the camera may help.” He said, “The dictum, then, of the social\nworker is “Let there be light;” and in this campaign for light we have for our advance\nagent the light writer — the photograph.” He traveled extensively, gathering information,\ninterviews, and images of working children across the country. He visited coal mines in Pennsylvania. Where adolescent “breaker boys” worked\nunderground for hours, separating impurities from coal. Sardine cutters in Maine. Oyster shuckers in Louisiana, some as young\nas 4 years old. Tobacco pickers in Kentucky. Cranberry pickers in Massachusetts. Beet farms in Colorado. And young messengers and newsboys in cities\nall over the country. Many of the photos captured adults nearby,\nsupervising the children while they worked. When Hine wasn’t allowed access to the mills\nand factories, he waited outside and documented the comings and goings of its\nworkers, whose shifts often lasted late into the night. Laborers would pose for portraits and tell\nHine a bit about themselves, their wages, and their work conditions. Sometimes they showed their horrific injuries\nand described what happened, like this boy from Bessemer City, North Carolina, whose\nhand got crushed in the gears of a cotton spinner. We know that because each photo, numbering\nover 5,000, includes a detailed caption written by Hine. Hine coined the term “photo stories” to\ndescribe this marriage of images and text, and it’s a big part of how the photos humanized\nthe lives of child laborers to an indifferent public. But it’s also his photographic technique\nthat makes them feel so personal. Let’s use the photos of cotton mill workers\nlike Sadie as an example. First, many of these photos are framed the\nexact same way, just substituting a different worker. Hine was trying to show that each child’s\nexperience was part of a widespread problem, and the repetition in the images signals that. You can really see how intentional the framing\nis when you look at how the image of Sadie appeared when it was first published in a\nProgressive magazine, in 1909. It’s opposite a nearly identical photo of\na different worker, set so that the symmetry of the two images makes the machinery seem\nto go on and on. The left-hand caption says, “Spinner. A type of many in the mill.” Hine’s photographs are also shot with a\nvery shallow depth of field, which basically means a narrow part of the photo is in focus,\nand the rest is blurred out. A photo with a deep depth of field would look\nlike this one by Jacob Riis, who was photographing New York City slums around the same time as\nHine. Notice how the playground in the background\nis in focus, just like the kids in the foreground. Now look at Hine’s portraits. In this one, the factory this boy works at\nlooms behind him, but it’s almost totally blurred out. This was a recurring visual theme — to include\nthe machinery or the workplace in the frame, but obscure it, favoring the worker instead. This narrow point of focus, combined with\nshooting from a lower angle — the eye level of these children — is why these images\nare so effective at humanizing their subjects. Photos like the ones from the South Carolina\ncotton mills changed the public perception of child labor in the United States, ultimately pressuring state legislatures to\nintroduce laws regulating work for those under the age of 18 — and sending kids back to\nschool. Lewis Hine went on to photograph the construction\nof the Empire State Building in New York City, using the same dignifying techniques he photographed\nchild laborers with: Considering the perspective of his subjects with a narrow focus, emphasizing the worker,\nnot the machinery. Hine was one of the first to use a camera\nas a tool for social documentary, to shine a light on the mostly unseen. He understood early on the power images have\nto tell stories. As he said in that 1909 speech: “Take the photograph of a tiny spinner in\na Carolina cotton mill. With a picture thus sympathetically interpreted,\nwhat a lever we have for the social uplift.” Hey everyone, that was Darkroom season 1!

It uses an incredible amount of resources, emits toxic pollutants into the air, and pumps the ground full of formaldehyde, which is known to cause cancer. It's also prohibitively expensive. The average cost of a modern funeral costs between $10,000 to $12,000.There are a number of greener options available though. Cremation uses less resources and requires less space than a traditional burial, but isn't perfect. There are more experimental methods on the horizon  such as promession and alkaline hydrolysis. No matter which method we choose, it's clear that we need to reform how we bury the dead.Also be sure to read Mark Harris's excellent book about green burials http://www.gravematters.us",Vox,o2dvXWX3Sdw,"[""When I say “funeral” this is probably\nwhat you think of, right? The cemetery, the casket, the gorgeous floral\narrangements. Vin Diesel stylishly going two buttons undone\non the dress shirt. But what if I told you that other than Dominic\nToretto’s effortless style, this was probably the worst way you could\ndispose of a body? This traditional casket in the ground method\nmost of us are used to is what journalist Mark Harris calls a “modern\nburial.” And that is the chemical embalming of the\nremains, the burial of the body or the placement of\nthe body into a metal casket, and then the placing of that casket and embalmed\nbody in the bottom of the grave that we call the\nburial vault. So that’s pretty much the American way of\ndeath. Aside from being a great name for a novel, the American way of death actually turns out\nto be pretty terrible. The average cost of modern burial runs on\naverage from $10,000 to $12,000. Although you can talk to families who will\ntell you they paid a lot more than that. In many cases, a lot more. This KISS casket alone will set you back seven\ngrand. No word on if the amps are included though. The funeral industry has also been known to\nengage in predatory business practices, like selling vulnerable families add-ons and\nservices that they don’t need. They’ve also been the subject of a number\nof class action lawsuits, including one for conspiring to fix the prices\nof caskets at artificially high prices. “Modern” burials are also incredibly wasteful. The average grave site takes up 32 square\nfeet of land in a cemetery. And that’s just space. It uses a staggering amount of resources as\nwell. Which \nalmost sounds kind of fun right? Grill up some hotdogs, toss some diving rings\nin for the kids to fetch. Not so fast. Formalin, which is the formaldehyde-based\npreservative solution embalmers use, is incredibly toxic. OSHA deems it a dangerous carcinogen and strictly\nregulates its use, and the EPA treats it as a hazardous waste. Embalmers experience higher levels of brain,\ncolon, and prostate cancer as well as leukemia. To embalm a typical body it requires 3 pounds\nof this formalin solution and sends 120 gallons of untreated “funeral\nwaste” directly into the sewage system, including blood, water, fecal matter, organ\nfluid, and carcinogenic chemicals, as well as whatever unknown diseases the body\ncontains. Okay cool, so modern funerals suck. But what are the other options? Well, let’s start with cremation. Countries all across the world cremate bodies. In Great Britain, 75% of people get cremated, in Switzerland it’s 85%, and in Japan that number is almost 100%. Two years ago, for the first time in this\ncountry’s history, more Americans were cremated than buried and then pretty soon we’re going to hit\n50% of Americans being cremated. For one thing, it’s a lot cheaper. A typical cremation costs around $1,400 compared\nto the $10,000 to $12,000 price tag we mentioned earlier. (Again, a little more for that sweet KISS\ncasket.) Cremating a body also requires much less space, since there doesn’t need to be a grave. And it doesn’t require a swimming pool full\nof formaldehyde either … sorry kids. You can also do all sorts of fun stuff with\nyour ashes like put them in fireworks, spread them in a National Park, or even turn them into a reef. But is it actually better \nfor the environment? So it sounds like cremation is better, although\nit’s far from perfect. Is there no way to do this without hurting\nthe environment? Swedish scientists asked that same question\nand developed something called promession. It’s a process where you freeze a corpse\nin liquid nitrogen, rapidly vibrate the body so it breaks into\nmillions of tiny particles in just a few minutes, then freeze dry the particles and remove the\nharmful metals leftover from your dental fillings. You’re left with a fine dust which actually\nlooks very similar to cremated remains. It solves most of the problems of “modern”\nburial and cremation but unfortunately hasn’t been approved for\nhuman beings yet. Another option is alkaline hydrolysis, where a body is put into a chamber which is\nthen filled with water and lye, pressurized, and heated up to about 320 °F. The body tissue is broken down in a process\nthat’s similar to natural decomposition, and dissolved to nothing but a skeleton in\nabout 12 hours. Damn, spooky. It’s more environmentally friendly since\nthere’s zero toxic emissions and it has about one-tenth of the carbon footprint\nas a cremation. All that said, the simplest option might be\nnatural burial. A number of natural cemeteries have sprung\nup across the country where unembalmed bodies are buried in biodegradable\ncontainers, or sometimes nothing at all, and allowed to\ndecompose naturally. It’s inexpensive, natural, and can actually help preserve and restore\nvulnerable land and wildlife. Not to mention it’s how humans have done\nit for most of recorded history. No matter what the method, though, it’s\nclear that we have to reform the way that we bury the dead. In less than a quarter-century 76 million\npeople in America alone will get to the average life expectancy of\n78 years. If all those people were buried in traditional\ngraves, we'd need a cemetery the size of Las Vegas\nto accommodate their bodies. The point is, we're all going to die. The question is, what are we going to do with\nall the bodies?""]"
48,0,Why so many sitcoms look the same,"The one about sitcom lighting.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOIn this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards explores the surprising history behind sitcom lighting.Karl Freund was the genius cinematographer behind Metropolis, the silent film classic.

But at the time, Freund had a good reason to tackle the challenge.These lighting techniques are still in use today on sitcoms like Friends, the Big Bang Theory, and other multi-camera hits.

No, it’s not all the audience laughter. They all kind of look…the same. And the shots and lighting all are kinda the\nsame. These are three camera sitcoms, with very\nfamiliar camera angles and lighting. And the guy who perfected the style of light\nthat would one day shine upon Urkel’s face? “Did I do that?” It’s Karl Freund. The same guy who made...this. He was the German cinematographer behind the\nlook of “Metropolis,” the 1927 classic. And there was actually a good reason that\na genius decided that going from this to this was a challenge worth betting his\ncareer on. This right here is cinematic history. It’s from 1924’s “The Last Laugh.” For this movie, Karl Freund invented what\nwas probably the first dolly shot in history - that’s when a camera moves on a cart or\na track. When Freund moved from Germany to Hollywood,\nhe continued to make visual masterpieces from directing the original “The Mummy,” to\nbeing the cinematographer on “Dracula.” This scene from Dracula is emblematic of his\nwork, with shadows and light serving as powerful tools in the scene. With 1937’s “The Good Earth,” he won\nan Academy Award for Cinematography. Freund’s art came from powerful imagery\nand stark contrasts, like in this scene from Metropolis. I Love Lucy looked good - but pretty flat. That’s why it’s so surprising that he\nthought it could be a breakthrough. We know Freund was nervous about making a\ntransition from movies like this to television filmed in front of a live audience. Traditional movie lighting wouldn't work in\nthat environment and on a tight TV schedule. Here's why. Dramatic lighting is cool. But if I move, the way people move in sitcoms,\nI lose the light and the shot. You also can't reset and move that light in front\nof a live audience. The shot also has to be lit so that it can be shown\nby three different cameras at the same time. That challenge appealed to Freund, and, laugh\ntrack jokes aside, he wrote that a live studio audience had “an astonishing effect in stimulating\nperformers.” There were earlier experiments with live taping,\nbut Freund perfected it. You can see how he did it in I Love Lucy’s\nvery first episodes and in this on set picture. First, he put three cameras on his trademark\ndollies - which is why these are called three camera sitcoms. Usually it has one camera in the middle, for\nwide shots, and two on the sides for closeups. You can see it here, as well as in the tape\nhe used to mark the cameras’ positions. This is how it worked — letting cameras\nmove on the fly, without relighting. Cameramen coordinated at all times using headsets\nand they were connected to the control room. To light this set up, Freund used an overhead\ngrid of lights like these and even put floor lights on the bottom of each camera to flatter\nactors’ faces. This? This is not like I Love Lucy. He also placed microphones around the set\nso they wouldn’t get in the way. Lucy and Ethel could bounce around the living\nroom without needing to stop taping — or stop the laughter. All of this let them keep a strict shooting\nschedule with minimum reshoots after the show. For Freund, all this visual work was in service\nof making one sound possible. This is still kind of how it’s done today. Freund’s tricks established a template for\nthe three camera sitcom that’s still in use today. As you can see it in “Vox”\n- the first workplace sitcom where people actually work. Anyway, as you can see, there’s no need\nto relight Dean as he crosses the room in this scene, only to be ignored by Ashley, because she's too busy working. Freund’s techniques did have drawbacks,\nsome of those drawbacks are visible in today’s sitcoms, and some are specific to the time\nin which he worked. He had to put darker makeup on his actors\nso they wouldn’t be blown out by the lights - and you can see it on Lucy and Ethel here. In this scene, they were probably wearing\npastel clothing as well, because nothing could be too bright — film processing gave everything\nhigher contrast than normal. Even today the three camera sitcom has\na less adventurous look — as you can see as AJ and Ashley go through all their unread emails. It affects focus, too - look at the Big Bang\nTheory next to its prequel, Young Sheldon. Big Bang Theory, the 3 camera sitcom, looks\npretty much like I Love Lucy. There are very few, or faint shadows, everything’s\nin focus, and the camera angles are familiar. Young Sheldon is single camera, like a movie,\nand that allows it to have light and shadow and a gorgeous blurred background. But Freund’s innovation did help a live\naudience — and us — see Friends, and Seinfeld, and Frasier. As he wrote in 1953: “To have had the opportunity\nto play a part in the success of the I Love Lucy show, which is now the No. 1 rated Television\nshow in the nation assures me the efforts to overcome the handicaps have not been in\nvain.” Karl Freund was a genius. And sometimes even genius has a sense of humor.""]"

It happens just after Dorothy croons in sepia-toned\nKansas, Toto wags his tail,\nand the house gets caught in a tornado. She travels from a faded film strip to a Technicolor\nworld. But there are three things about this scene\nyou might get wrong. And each one helps show the real history of\nTechnicolor. These misconceptions explain what the\n“Technicolor triumph” really was, from the technical aspects that made it work, to\nexactly why it took over the movies, to the way in which the technology shaped the look\nof the 20th century. Lie #1 - Wizard of Oz is not the first Technicolor\nmovie. Not even close. You might know that, but a lot of people don’t. Come on Maryland Science Center, you’re\nbetter than this. Historian Barbara Flueckiger has an exhaustive\ntimeline of color in film, from hand-painted film\nto the first movie filmed in “kinemacolor,” A Visit to the Seaside. But Technicolor stood out, and even it has\na history that long predates The Wizard of Oz. Herbert Kalmus, Daniel Frost Comstock, and\nW. Burton Wescott founded the company in 1914, with the “Tech” referring to MIT, where\nKalmus and Comstock met. It started by merging red and green - into\na new image that roughly looked like this. You can see the look in this range of movies\nfrom the late 1920s and early 30s. It could do passably well with skin tones,\nbut there’s no blue in these dresses for a reason. Blue came into the mix in 1932, when Technicolor\nadded the key third strip. They showed off the process in Walt Disney’s\nFlowers and Trees, a gorgeous animated feature that was a botanist’s nightmare. You know, there are evil trees in Wizard of\nOz, too. “What do you think you’re doing?” Anyway, in order to get Technicolor to work,\nit was an insanely difficult process. Technicolor distributed\nguides like these and we can make a reasonable simulation digitally,\nwith a scene like this. So here’s a scene of some Lego people who\nare apparently worshipping Lawrence of Arabia? Not sure what’s going on here, but it’s\nour starting image. A technicolor camera would typically take\nthat picture and shoot it through a prism that split the light into red, blue, and green\nnegatives for the picture. Those negatives were then flipped into positive\n“matrices,” which eventually got soaked with dyes of the\ncomplementary colors. So the red matrix turned cyan, the green one\nmagenta, and the blue one yellow. Then the dye was transferred — this was\ncalled a “dye transfer process” to create a final gorgeous Technicolor image. So if you’re anything like me, that explanation\nmight make you feel like the scarecrow. “Oh I’m a failure because I haven’t\ngot a brain.” So let’s try it again, but only look at\nthat red channel. So keep your eye on the View-Master, the red\nin the Rubik’s cube, or maybe the Lego guy’s hat. It is all kind of dark now, because that’s\njust the red color in the negative. Now flipped in the matrix, that red is really\nbright, which means that when it’s dyed, it won’t get a lot of\ncyan. And that makes sense. Cyan is the complementary color — it’s\nthe anti-red. So where you want a lot of red, you do not\nwant a lot of cyan. That way, when it comes together, you get\na ton of magenta and some yellow. You don’t have a lot of cyan, because the\ncyan cancels out the red. In the earlier days of Technicolor, they also\nhad to amp up the contrast. The company would add a black and white layer\nunderneath the matrices to serve as something called ""the key."" You can see the results early, in films like\n1934’s La Cucaracha, The Trail of the Lonesome Pine,\nand Robin Hood, all of which came out well before the Wizard of Oz. It’s easy enough to roughly copy the technology\nthat “Technicolored” the Wizard of Oz. RGB split, color bath, mesh, repeat. But the film strip processes are just part\nof the story. Lie #2: this scene? It’s not going from a black and white world\nto a color one. The set was actually painted sepia-tone so\nthe same Technicolor process could be used for the bright Oz reveal. Today, it’s much easier. I can draw a box with my hand and with a click,\nblack and white and color play together. They even had techniques to do stuff like\nthis in the Oz days. But the fact that they built a sepia house\nshows how Technicolor’s technical limitations shaped all color movies. “This is one of the cameras that was used\nto film The Wizard of Oz.” “It weighs 4 to 500 pounds, and these cameras\nwere bigger than ordinary motion picture cameras because they had to run three strips of film\nthrough them at any given time.” So remember — this scene? That had to be done with this beast of a camera. Those three strips didn’t just require more\nspace, they needed tons of light. That set had to be blazingly overlit to get\nenough light through to these three strips of film. The set was reportedly 100 degrees Fahrenheit\nat times. Sound was an issue, too. “It’s so loud when you’re running three\nstrips of film through a camera, so they had to build this blimp around it. It’s filled with soundproofing material\nso when you’re making a sound film you don’t get all the sound from the camera throughout\nthe studio there.” Technicolor’s advantages outweighed its\nlimitations. It’s main advantage was the way in which\nit could capture the tone of a scene. Two movies made in the same year could have\na different look, not just because of the choices made in front of the camera. Technicolor consultants and directors tweaked\nthe palette of the film by adjusting the cyan, magenta and yellow dyes. The complicated dye transfer process gave\nSingin’ in the Rain some of its magenta-hued skin and deep saturated colors. The film and technology weren’t the only\nthings that gave Technicolor movies their distinctive look. It also shaped the world that they chose to\nfilm. Lie #3: This isn’t the real Dorothy. It’s Judy Garland’s body double. She wore specially designed clothes and makeup\nto match the sepia world, so Judy Garland could swoop in, in the same shot and\na blue dress, to join Technicolor Oz. These movies, and Oz, were shaped around Technicolor’s\nabilities, from head to toe. “The second page that you see here is the\npart of the script that shows the ruby slippers being unveiled, but what it shows is that\nthey were still silver shoes at this point, but the producers of the film really wanted\nto show off that Technicolor that they were paying for, so they wanted them to be sparkly\nruby slippers that would look good against the yellow brick road. So they changed it at the middle of production\nto ruby slippers.” Today, the shoes are kept under low light\nto preserve them, but during the shoot they were blasted with light to accommodate the\ncamera and make those sequins sparkle. These weren’t just on-set decisions — Technicolor\nwas always pulling strings behind the curtains. Look at the credits for Wizard of Oz, and The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and A\nStar is Born, and so on and so on. You’ll see one name over and over. Natalie Kalmus. Once married to Technicolor cofounder Herb\nKalmus, she ruled with an iron fist over Technicolor productions for many of the early\nyears. Kalmus had over 300 film credits where she\ngave Technicolor advice — and sometimes told directors what to do. This is the IMDB page for a woman born in\n1882. In \ndocuments like “Color Consciousness,” she extended her reach into art — the essay\nincludes aesthetic color theory. “Red: danger, blood, life, heat. Green: Nature, outdoors, freedom, freshness.” Kalmus’s influence was significant, but\nit’s as important as a reflection of Technicolor’s power. Technicolor had its own processing facilities,\nand its own camera crew that continued Natalie Kalmus’ work after she left the company. The technology and the production process\ngave Technicolor a significant competitive advantage to alternatives being used. Despite all those alternatives shown on Barbara\nFlueckiger’s website, studios stuck with Technicolor for a long time. It had a reliable system and\ncould be shown in any theatre in splendid color, without requiring special equipment. Technicolor eventually fell to cheaper processes\nthrough the 1950s, like Eastman Color, that used a single strip. The Godfather, Part II was one of the final\nmajor releases to use the Technicolor we recognize. But old prints remain surprisingly vibrant\ntoday due to the dye transfer process used. Today, I can snap my fingers and be in\nThe Matrix or in Stranger Things’ Upside Down. Ok. What are all these dust particles? Is this asbestos? Am I covered in asbestos right now? Technicolor was never just a click —\nthe look was formed by the camera’s strengths and weaknesses, the artistic choices made\nfor color, and the Technicolor company’s infrastructure and supervision. In that key scene from the Wizard of Oz, you\nmight not have known the trivia about Dorothy’s double, or the sepia doorway, or even that\nit wasn’t Technicolor’s debut. But one thing is easy to understand, intuitively. The movie is all about it. Technicolor wasn’t a switch or a doorway. It was a whole world, just waiting on the\nother side. You can nerd out a lot more on Technicolor\nby checking out Barbara Flueckiger’s website, or Eastman House, which was really generous\nwith their time and a lot of the images that you saw in this video. I’ve linked both of those below. You can see the director’s commentary for\nthis video in an additional video that we’ve made where I share some behind-the-scenes\ninfo and a few of the details that couldn’t quite fit in.']"

Tens of millions of people saw Captain America:\nCivil War, but this past May, Marvel only sold 177,000\ncopies of Civil War II. But if you took Marvel’s opening credits\nand replaced this with this,\neven the people who’d never touched a comic book page..would notice. Everybody knows the “comic book font.” How could there be a universally recognized\nfont for something that, for a half century, was written by hand? Is it a font at all? How is that possible? These fonts are made by people called “letterers.” And their work shows how hundreds of lettering\nartists can come together into a single recognizable style. And how we, as consumers, then manage to get\nit completely wrong. If you go to a comic book store,\nyou can see comics that were gloriously lettered by hand,\nlike this 1964 issue of Thor. (Yes, it was a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby production.) And they worked with Artie Simek. Artie probably gave Thor this epic WHOOM. Letterers place and draw expressive dialogue\nbubbles like this one. But in Artie’s day, they also hand wrote\nevery word in a dialogue bubble. And a lot of practical conditions shaped the\nartistry of the letters. “What I think of as comic book lettering\nis 1960s Marvel comics. They were mainly lettered by two guys: Artie\nSimek and Sam Rosen. For me, they kind of nailed it.” That’s John Roshell, who founded Comicraft,\na comic book font company, with Richard Starkings. They’re letterers and writers, and they\nmake fonts like this one and comics like this one. The fonts they design imitate a style that\nformed out of necessity. That style came out of the newspaper world\nand newspaper technology. Early comics like “Little Nemo,” which\ncame out in the 1900s, started to develop a style that was readable on cheap paper. You can see it forming in this bubble — it’s\nall caps, like a comic book font, but it’s somehow...wrong. As time went on, that changed. “Certainly early on, comic strips and comic\nbooks were lettered by the artist. As they gained popularity, that’s when the\nproduction model started to get split up, basically to meet the demand. The letterer was probably just somebody in\nthe office who had good handwriting, who could do it fast enough.” But the form’s limitations shaped the style\nthat emerged across the industry. Most letterers used an Ames guide like this\none to create their lines, which meant each letter hit the same height and, more likely,\nhit middle in the middle of the line. These letters became kind of squat because\nthey’re really trying to hit the lines on the top and bottom of the guide. That led to generally rounder Os\nand fatter As with lower crosses. Earlier letterers also used a Speedball Nib\npen or a technical pen. These things here: they’re nibs. They determine a letter’s shape, and an\nartist could use any type they wanted. But a lot of the time, they chose nibs that\ngave them a consistent stroke width. Compare this “Loki” to one that shows\nup in Times New Roman. Now look at the Times one. It has a skinny base on the L, a very narrow\nO at the top, and all sorts of other little details where the stroke width varies. Arti Simek’s Loki, however, has a really\nconsistent width to it. The quality of the pages also influenced the\nstyle that letterers chose. Here’s that 1964 Thor next to Thor from\n2016. Just look at the difference between the pages. Today’s glossy Thor can handle all sorts\nof letters, but 1964’s couldn’t. Letterers wrote in all caps to compensate. Look at this ad from 1964’s Thor. The ink is blotchy and hard to read. All caps helps fix that. And see how the tail on the y and g forces\nthat whole line to be longer? All caps helped letterers fit more dialogue\ninto less space, and keep it clear on lousy paper. Other rules emerged too. Never cross an I, unless it’s by itself,\nalways italicize and bold for emphasis — and all of them were made to make comics printed\non bad paper easier to read. Consistency also mattered in case another\nletterer jumped in to finish a page or fix up a typo. And all those constraints and choices created\nthe handwritten style we recognize. But today to call it handwriting would be\nlying. Richard Starkings, who runs Comicraft with\nJohn Roshell, was frustrated with the work involved in lettering. This is the Killing Joke, it’s a classic,\ncontroversial 80s comic that’s been reprinted in deluxe editions. And Richard Starkings lettered it. Starkings\nhad an experienced letterer’s appreciation of detail. He was frustrated by the work involved in\nlettering, and an industry that knew that computers were the future, but wasn’t willing\nto go there just yet. There’d been earlier attempts to standardize\nfonts in comics — most famously a publisher called EC comics\nused a guide to trace every letter, and the result ended up looking kind of mechanical,\nlike type. Other publishers played with type too. But Starkings and Roshell led the charge into\ndigital fonts. “For a long time we had things our way because\nthere were a lot of technophobes in comics. There were a lot of people who didn’t want\nto change. Those people have grown old and there are\npeople in their 20s editing and designing comics now, and they expect you to have every\nfont in our library and then some.” Today, companies like Comicraft and competitors\nlike Blambot make fonts that letterers can download and then work with in programs like\nAdobe Illustrator. They still make the bubbles and design the\ntext — they just don’t use ink to do it. But those companies don’t just sell one\n“comic book font.” They sell a ton. And that’s because the idea of a “comic\nbook font” is a mistake in the first place. The general public only really became aware\nof fonts with the rise of personal computers. This chart shows the appearances of the word\n“font” in books from 1960 to 2000. We can see Helvetica, and Arial, and Futura\nbecause our computers have trained us to look for them. Some fonts came with our machines or condensed\nin the document cloud. We notice them. We see these tiny differences. There have always been hundreds of “comic\nbook fonts” too, attuned to the idiosyncrasies of the artists who used to letter them. But most people, just like me, haven’t been\ntrained to see the nuance in their work. Comics fans and letterers do. “That’s a Todd Klein R. Different letterers\nhave their letters of the alphabet that are kind of their signature.” “Dave Gibbons, his D and his G, his G is\nalmost a six, it’s a real loop around on itself.” Even Richard Starkings has a quirk — a jagged\nhook on the S that always stands out. As technology allows for variety and ease\nof use, creativity continues to flourish, even if handwriting gets digitized. Comics like Klaus can use color with abandon,\nand artsy comics like The Joyners are able to experiment with all kinds of fonts without\nworrying about cheap paper reducing readability. The “comic book font” is a starting point\n— an idea we keep around because it shows the verve of comics. Within that style is the variety of different\nartists and designers, expressing a key element in every story. And maybe even some of those superhero movie\nfans will notice it. So in addition to identifying a letterer by\ntheir handwriting, sometimes you can spot one by the style of their bubbles. John Workman is famous for creating word bubbles\nthat jut right into the gutter of a page, and it creates a really distinctive style\nthat’s easy to spot.']"

The color of military uniforms, signs, vehicles, and world fashion spanning decades needs to be accounted for before even opening digital software like Photoshop. That means digging through sources like diaries, government records, old advertisements, and even consulting historical experts to get the colors right.But even after the arduous research, restoration, and blending of color, the image still isn’t finished. In order to achieve true photorealism, the physics of how light works in the atmosphere needs to be taken into account. Colors look different depending on the lighting conditions when the photo was taken, so artists rely on shadows and the location of light to make an educated guess about the time of day in a black-and-white photo.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Mark Twain, Amelia Earhart, a young Charlie\nChaplin. It’s incredible how normal these people\nlook because they’re no longer in black and white. Like they’re someone you could pass by on\nthe street and not someone unreachable or from another time. What I love about these photos is that they\nshow people and moments in history that have never been seen in color — except by those\nwho were actually there. I talked to several artists who do this work\nto try to figure out what it is about adding color to photos that seems to make years of\nseparation fade away. One of those artists is Jordan Lloyd, and\nhe actually does this for a living. He and his small London-based team at Dynamichrome\nuse modern technology to digitally reconstruct history’s black and white record. When you’re missing the color, you’re\nkind of looking at the entire composition as a whole. Whereas when you add the color you start looking\nat the photograph in a slightly different way, and you start picking up all these really\ninteresting details that you might not have noticed before. This change in perspective is why these images\nfeel like they’ve suddenly “come to life.” Like, when you see workers from over 80 years\nago wearing blue denim, you instantly see something you can relate to. Colorization makes old photos look more current. But adding color to black and white photos\nisn’t new. It’s a practice that is nearly as old as\nphotography itself. It dates back to the 1800s when images were\ncolored by hand or through a process called Photochrom, which added anywhere from six\nto 15 layers of color to a photo negative. But these didn’t exactly end up looking\nsuper realistic, at least not like this, for example. With digital colorization, the difference\nis that software like Photoshop, along with a vast number of online resources, has made\nit possible for artists to reconstruct images with far more accuracy. They can turn to historical documents to find\nthe exact colors that would recreate a moment in time. Sounds simple, right? Yeah, it’s a shitload of work [laughs]. The secret to doing the research for the colorization\nis, you now have a wealth of information, it’s just knowing where to look. It means digging through diaries and memoirs,\ngovernment records, old advertisements, and even consulting historical experts to be sure\nthat the colors and styles of the time are faithfully represented. A good colorizer has a good network of people\nto call on. We had one guy, he’s like a specialist at\nethnographic dress. You know, he was showing me, like, museum-grade\nsamples, you know, and he lives and breathes this stuff so, like, every single little detail,\nlike the color of beads on a Laplander necklace or something, you know, it’s really: “This\nhas got to be the exact thing.” Take this photo series of Tutankhamun’s\ntomb, which was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922. Jordan colorized these images based on the\narchaeologist’s detailed hand-written notes. And by cross-referencing his journals with\nrestored artifacts on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, he was able to recreate what\nthat day looked like almost a hundred years ago. Research like this allows colorizers to stay\ntrue to the historical moment. And sometimes a single photograph can reveal\na thing or two about the past. Like, did you know that until the late 60s,\n7UP’s logo was red on black, instead of the green we know today? That’s really important to know if you want\nto colorize this photo from 1938. And if you wanted to recreate this day in\nParis in 1888, you would need to know that the incomplete Eiffel Tower was painted a\ncolor called “Venetian red.” All right, so how do they actually do it? Essentially, it’s literally taking a graphics\ntablet and, you know, literally coloring within the lines. Okay, obviously it isn’t actually that simple. It all starts with the careful repairing of\nany cracks and scratches the black and white photo picked up through decades of deterioration\nin storage. Once the image has been restored to its original\nstate, dozens and up to hundreds of layers of color are painstakingly added and blended\ntogether. Human skin alone can have up to 20 layers\nof pinks, yellows, greens, reds, and blues to simulate what a living person is supposed\nto look like. It can take hours, even days to finish a single\nimage. I think the longest I’ve spent on an image\nis nearly a month. What comes next is pretty interesting, because\neven after meticulous research, restoration, and blending of colors, there’s something\nthat every good colorization artist needs to have: an intuitive understanding of how\nlight works in the atmosphere. Light affects our perception of color, so\neven though research can give you the color information, you’ll need to take into account\nhow those colors looked under a specific lighting condition. But how can you tell? You can usually tell what the atmospheric\nconditions were based on things like shadows, and triangulation of light location, things\nlike that. For example, this photo was taken in the late\nafternoon. Look at the long shadows the people are casting\non the sidewalk. The sun is low, and at this time of day, often\nreferred to as “the golden hour,” everything is cast in a sort of orange glow, which you\ncan see in the reflections of this car. Or take a look at this photo of Harry Houdini\nfrom 1912. The cloudy and hazy sky, the soft, almost\ninvisible shadows, and Houdini’s windswept hair are all strong indicators that this was\na dreary day at the New York docks, which calls for muted colors and a greenish tint. But weather conditions aren’t the only thing\nto consider. Reflected light off of certain materials influences\ncolor too. Like the orange glow of molten steel, or light\nbouncing up from a blue carpet, for example. These kinds of details are critical to simulating\nan environment and achieving true photorealism. I should take a second here to mention that\nnot everyone is into the work colorization artists are doing. There’s been some pushback, with critics\narguing that these photos should be left untouched. There’s a lot of accusations, not just to\nme but to pretty much anyone who does it, which is that, you know, we’re vandalizing\nart or fucking up history. And the thing about that is that these things\nare not supposed to be substitutes for original documents. It sits alongside the original. But it’s not a substitute; it’s a supplement. Colorization artists are able to create such\nhigh-quality versions of old images because institutions like the Library of Congress\nand the US National Archive have carefully digitized and cataloged thousands of original\ndocuments from over a century and a half of photographic history. And since these photos are in the public domain,\nthey can be altered in any way. Which means that we get to see a color photo\nof Abraham Lincoln, blue eyes and all. Beyond the fact that these are really fun\nto look at, colorization presents a new perspective on history. It offers a more relatable look at huge moments,\nlike the construction of the Hoover Dam. And small ones too. You find out all these amazing stories. When you start looking at all the individual\nthings. What happened to all these companies? What happened to this person, what happened\nhere? And all of a sudden, you no longer see history\nas a linear timeline, but rather it’s a tapestry of all these extremely rich moments. It’s really mind-blowing, actually.']"
53,1,How Negative Yields Work | WSJ,Negative yields are occurring with greater frequency in global bond markets. What generates negative yields and why do investors continue to buy these money-losing bonds?More from the Wall Street Journal: Visit WSJ.com: http://www.wsj.comVisit the WSJ Video Center: https://wsj.com/videoOn Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pg/wsj/videos/On Twitter: https://twitter.com/WSJOn Snapchat: https://on.wsj.com/2ratjSM #WSJ #Bonds #YieldCurve,Wall Street Journal,eyBZWrp9P4U,"[""(gentle music) - [Narrator] This chart shows the yield on the German government's 30-year bonds over the past few months. You'll notice something unusual\nhappened in early August. The yield dropped below zero. A yield is the return\ninvestors receive on a bond. A negative yield is the\nopposite, meaning investors are receiving less money\nthan they originally paid. Negative yields are a\nrelatively new feature in the world's bond markets,\nbut they're appearing with increasing frequency. Globally, around $16\ntrillion worth of bonds currently carry a negative yield. Bonds are one of the safest\ninvestments on the market. They're staples of many\ninvestment portfolios, from pension funds to retirement accounts. Investors like them because\nof their reliable returns. So how did some bond yields go negative? And why would investors\nkeep putting their money in assets with negative returns? To understand negative yields, you need to understand how bonds work. Bonds are a form of debt that governments and companies issue for\nvarious lengths of time. A bond's lifespan can\nrange from a few weeks to a few decades. Bond issuers make\nregular interest payments to bond holders over the asset's lifespan. This is known as the coupon rate. But bonds are often bought and\nsold on the secondary market. Their prices fluctuate, which affects what an investor can expect to earn. The yield is a calculation\nof how much an investor can expect to make from\nholding onto a bond bought at a particular price for a\nparticular length of time. The yield of a bond is\ninversely related to its price. High demand in the bond\nmarket drives up prices and drives down yields. This is largely why yields are negative. Right now, the bond market is experiencing unusually high demand. There are a few reasons for this. The first is that investors have grown increasingly concerned\nabout the lack of growth in the global economy. Amid low inflation, political uncertainty, and trade disputes, investors\nare putting more money into safer assets, like bonds. The second is that several\ncentral banks around the world have set their interest rates below zero. Central banks are banks\nfor commercial banks. So when they set negative\ninterest rates, commercial banks must pay them for the privilege\nof holding their money. This incentivizes commercial banks to lower the interest\nrates they charge to. So far, commercial banks\nhave been reluctant to pass that negative\nrate to average consumers, but some have passed on\nthe cost to companies and large institutional investors. Negative rates give investors\nan incentive to buy bonds rather than park their money at a bank. This drives up demand. These factors have\npushed bond prices higher and driven down yields, so\nmuch so that they are now in negative territory and,\nin some cases, even below the negative rates set by central banks. So why would investors\ncontinue to buy bonds with negative yields? Well, if demand continues\nto rise, buying now means potentially selling bonds\nlater at a higher price. This can help offset\nlosses in the short term, but the long-term implications\nof negative yields could mean lower returns on pensions\nand retirement accounts, meaning workers might have\nto save more and work longer. Negative bond yields, and\nnegative interest rates in general, are viewed\nas a short-term remedy to get economies moving. But with the footprint of\nnegative rates getting deeper and wider, investors worry\nthat they may be less of a temporary fix, and\nmore of a permanent fixture in the market. (gentle music)""]"
54,1,How the Government Creates Stimulus Money | WSJ,Both Congress and the Federal Reserve are pumping trillions of dollars into the economy to fight the economic damage caused by the coronavirus. WSJ explains where all that stimulus money is coming from.

Within weeks, the government moved to provide trillions of\ndollars of stimulus relief to workers and businesses\nthroughout the economy. - $1200 checks to anyone\nwho makes less than $75,000. - This is another $600\na week for four months. - [Reporter] Congress approving another $484 billion for loans. - [Narrator] So where does\nall this money come from? Is it taxpayer funds? Is the government printing\na bunch of new cash? As you might expect,\nthere's a lot more to know. (pleasant orchestral music) Congress can authorize taxes\nto pay for new spending, but that's not where the\nstimulus money is coming from. That money is being\nraised through borrowing. The government expects to\nborrow a record $4.5 trillion for the fiscal year\nthat ends in September. That's more than three\ntimes the $1.28 trillion it borrowed the year prior. That borrowed money is being used to subsidize small business payrolls, send checks to households, and offer taxpayers a temporary holiday on making tax payments. The Treasury Department is\nin charge of the borrowing. The agency borrows by selling\ntreasury bills or bonds to the three main groups of savers. The public sector, like other\nparts of the government, the private sector, which\nincludes companies or individuals like you and me, and foreign entities. These bills are like IOUs,\nsomeone agrees to buy them, and the government agrees to pay them back with a little bit of interest. In the meantime, the government can use that\nborrowed money for stimulus to support private\nindividuals and companies, or state and local governments. - This year, the federal\ngovernment will get most of its borrowing\nfrom the private sector, and the reason for that is\nbecause private borrowers who would normally be competing\nwith the federal government for private savings, have\nbasically disappeared. - [Narrator] That stimulus money\ncan make the economy larger than it otherwise would have been. It encourages employers\nto keep people employed, and it encourages individuals to spend. Here's a hypothetical example. Let's say Congress authorizes $1 billion in stimulus spending. The Treasury would borrow one billion by selling treasury bills. It would then use that borrowed money on the stimulus programs, with the hopes of keeping\nthe economy churning, but it doesn't end there. If the economy keeps moving, households and businesses\ncan keep earning income, and some of that income can be saved, and in the future, they\ncan use those savings to invest in more treasury bills, supplying the government\nwith more money to spend. - The amount of saving in the\neconomy is not a fixed amount. Federal stimulus can actually\nresult in more people working, more firms having profits, higher incomes than would have been the case if there hadn't been any\nfederal stimulus at all. This is known as Keynesian stimulus name for the British\neconomist John Maynard Keynes who first came up with the\nconcept back in the 1930s. The government is not like a\nfamily that has a fixed amount and can't borrow more than it can pay back because it'll go bankrupt. Government can in effect borrow enough to actually make the economy bigger. - [Narrator] Now on top\nof the three main sources of borrowing, there's another source too, the Federal Reserve. The central bank is\nlike the other sources, but with a key difference. The Fed can raise funds to buy treasuries by simply printing money. - So when we say the\nFed is printing money, we don't literally mean it's\nfiring up the printing presses and creating paper money. Instead, what we mean is the\nFed basically clicks a button and credit the Treasury's\naccount with this money. It's electronic money,\nit's not paper money. - [Narrator] In effect,\nthe Treasury sells a bond and in return gets brand new money. Right now, the Fed is\nramping up its lending. Assets on the central bank's balance sheet topped $6.7 trillion during\nthe first week of May 2020. That gives the Treasury\nmore money to spend on stimulating the economy\nand other programs. Critics of the stimulus,\nsay the government competing with other borrowers for savings will push up interest rates, making it harder for private companies and individuals to borrow and invest. They also say that if the Fed prints money to finance the borrowing, that will lead to inflation\nand economic turmoil, like what's seen in Venezuela and the trillion dollar\nnotes seen in Zimbabwe, - It's only a problem if\nthey print and they print and they print and the\nthose dollars gets spent and spent and spent again, until all that spending far exceeds the supply of goods and\nservices in our economy, that's when you get high inflation. How will we know that's happening? Well, we probably see long term\ninterest rates start to rise as investors get ready for\nthe approach of inflation. Then we'd start to see\nactual inflation rise, but we're not seeing that now. (pleasant mallet percussion music)""]"
55,1,How the Pandemic Could Transform Higher Ed | WSJ,"Will the coronavirus pandemic lead to long-term changes in higher education? To better understand the challenges facing U.S. colleges and universities, WSJ’s Alexander Hotz spoke with administrators, students, and a higher education futurist. Photo: Robert F.

In March, students were\nabruptly sent home, classes were moved online. Now, as campuses across\nthe country sit empty, administrators are scrambling to prepare for what comes next. - In many ways, the attack\nthat COVID represents to higher education is a\nreally straightforward assault on the bottom line. - The financial challenges are severe. I mean, I won't kid you,\nthey're profoundly challenging. - There will be more bankruptcies,\nmore business failures, more need to federal and state bailouts. - [Alexander] The pandemic\nhas thrown the budgets of public and private\ncolleges into turmoil. Since the lockdowns went into effect, they have seen their revenues\ndrop and their expenses climb. - And I think, yeah, more\nthan belt-tightening, this may be something like\nreconstructive surgery if not actually thoracic surgery. - [Alexander] With all\neducation now virtual, e-learning is having a moment. When students were sent home mid-semester, American higher ed began\nwhat was essentially a nationwide experiment. In the space of three weeks, all learning was moved from\nthe classroom to the internet. This has accelerated the\ntrend towards online education and raised more fundamental questions about the value of a college degree. - College students\nsuing Drexel University, the University of Miami and others saying online learning is no replacement for a bricks and mortar\non-campus experience. - What will be the\nlasting legacy of COVID-19 for higher education? Could this virus lead to a wave of college and university closures? Will the classroom we\nonce knew gradually return or could COVID permanently\ntransform how we learn? - Hello. - Hey, Bryan. To help answer these questions, I spoke to Bryan Alexander,\na higher education futurist. As his title suggest,\nAlexander spends a lot of time contemplating what might happen in the higher education space. In a passage included in his 2020 book, Alexander suggested the possibility of a global pandemic\ntransforming the industry. - I wrote the chapter in 2018, 2019, and I'm afraid it is chillingly prescient. - [Alexander] But how do you\nimagine a post-COVID future when so little is known\nabout COVID itself? With so much uncertainty\nsurrounding the pandemic, Alexander believes it's\nimpossible to divine any one outcome. Instead he sees three potential paths for the future of higher education. - One is that we could be in the middle of a short plague, that is, something which\nburns out relatively quickly, that perhaps a month from now, we are very, very far\ndown the downhill side and that, come August and September, we'll be in good shape and\ncolleges and universities can open their physical doors to welcome face-to-face students again. A second possibility is that the pandemic will extend through December into 2021. In that case, then we have to\nthink about higher education being virtual throughout\nthe entire fall semester. - [Alexander] Recently, the California State University system announced that it would be canceling most in-person classes in the fall and will instead hold them online. This is significant because\nthe Cal State system is the largest four-year\nuniversity system in the country. The system is also one of the\nmost diverse in the country, with 1/3 of undergraduates\nthe first in their families to attend college. One of those is Ana Ruth Bertolazzi, a senior at San Francisco\nState University. - As a single parent, my\nson, he's a seventh-grader, soon now close to be eighth-grader, it was a challenge. - [Alexander] Like many students, one challenge Ana has\nfaced are class disruptions due to a slow internet connection. - There are moments\nwhen, if I ask a question to my Zoom class professor, either my voice is not even\nprojecting or it stops. - [Alexander] Students like\nAna would also be impacted by Alexander's third forecast. - A third possibility is that, instead of having a simple\npandemic, short or long, that we'll have something more complicated with multiple waves. For academia, I dub this the toggle term. This is when a campus will\nhave to switch back and forth between face-to-face instruction and wholly online instruction. - [Alexander] Each of these\nscenarios would be costly. Even in the best forecast,\nwhere the pandemic is shorter and campuses reopen in the\nfall, there's no guarantee that all students and faculty will return. That means smaller classes\nand less revenue for schools. If the fall semester is online, Alexander expects the financial\nhit to be even more severe as more students demand tuition breaks. - We have about 4,400\ncolleges and universities in the U.S. all told, and\nI could see easily 10% staring into the abyss\nthis time next year. What worries me are, first of all, private colleges and universities that, you know, therefore\nlack any state support, but that are not the most highly ranked, the lower ranked and\nthe medium ranked ones. - [Alexander] Dominican\nUniversity is a small, private liberal arts college located in San Rafael, California. - We know we're gonna\nhave some financial hits. We know we'll have to make\nsome adjustments to get there, but we know where we're headed, and we're really reasonably\nwell-positioned to manage this. The place where Dominican\nis not as well-positioned, and it's true of many,\nmany small colleges, is we don't have deep pockets. You know, we have a\nreally small endowment. - [Alexander] But small private schools aren't the only ones at risk. Some state universities\nare in trouble as well. - I'm also concerned about\npublic university systems that are facing similar problems. For example, you think about Pennsylvania. - [Alexander] One of the\npublic systems at risk is Pennsylvania's State\nSystem of Higher Education, which is made up of 14 state-owned colleges and universities. - The challenges of higher education, public higher education generally, they're pretty acutely concentrated here. Obviously, a historic pattern\nof declining public investment has forced universities\nto increase tuition and actually net average price overall, so those challenges sort of have combined in our system to produce\nthe 20% enrollment decrease since 2010, between 2010 and 2019, and obviously, as our enrollments go down, we're in an enrollment-driven industry, and as a consequence, our\nrevenues have declined as well. - [Alexander] If there is\none consensus in higher ed, it's that online education is here to stay and that it will only grow in importance. One company that is uniquely positioned to understand this trend is Chegg. Chegg provides online services for about 60% of American\ncollege students. - When I went to college\nmany, many years ago, my Intro to Business courses\nwere 300-person lectures in a giant auditorium. Not only are those potentially\ndangerous right now, but the reality is, those lend\nthemselves very, very well to online learning. - [Alexander] Last semester,\nschools were forced online out of necessity, but the reality is, for many students, necessity\nmay keep them there. - We have to imagine\nthat many, many families are seeing their savings and\ninvestments put into chaos, those who have those, some of them are being hit economically by unemployment or underemployment. Some of them additionally\nare being hit by disease. - Like a lot of things right now, what you're seeing is an acceleration. There's already been a\nmovement of lots of people questioning the ROI of going\nin for a four-year degree that, all-in, may cost 250 or $300,000 for people, while they're also not working and getting a job that entire time. - [Alexander] More students\nonline means less revenue for schools, but Bryan\nAlexander is optimistic that the industry will get creative and adapt to students' needs. - Well, for looking at the fall, and if either of my\nscenarios come to pass, either the toggle term or the long plague and faculty and staff have to prepare for a full semester online, now we have months, not weeks, we have months to plan, prepare, shape, and hone the experience.
