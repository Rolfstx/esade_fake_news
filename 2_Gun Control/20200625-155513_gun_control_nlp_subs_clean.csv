0,0,Dawkins is famous as the author of  Selfish Gene the blind watchmaker and many other popular science books going back decades but hes a controversial figure out and about on Twitter these days railing against fundamentalist religious beliefs and non fundamentalist beliefs in ways that many have found objectionable he has his own foundations  reason and science one here one in the u.s. designed to try and remove the influence of religion from education and public life with religion community relations and tolerance much in the news at the moment we thought wed get his take in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks we were in the midst of a big debate really are we about the relationship between religious fundamentalists and the rest of society it was interesting that the mer Archbishop of Canterbury on  last week said the debate isnt really won between Christians and Muslims its more between the secular society and Muslims which I thought was an interesting observation but what do you think the rules of the game should be between a modern liberal democracy between these different groups you have very very different yes I mean I think thats oh thats a very profoundly important question I think the rules of the game are that you should be allowed to believe anything you like and of course thats  thats right but that you shouldnt impose your beliefs on other people and so any creed that thinks it has the right to say not only do we believe this but youve got to believe it too or else I mean that is a very very serious violation of everything that democracy stands  so lets take some examples could burqa bans they have a burqa ban in France you wouldnt be in favor of that I know I Im not in favor of a burka ban it seems to me to be a violation of individual liberty so it mean when I see a woman in a fall in a full burqa with just justice lit by feel personally offended but its part of its an important part of what I believe that what I feel personally is irrelevant it doesnt matter what I feel nobody else should abide by what I feel and that applies of course on the other side as well what about religious schools so a community sets up a school maybe pays  it itself that doesnt subscribe to your views of Education that youve set out today and now is that a freedom of speech thing  them to be able to teach what they want or not thats very difficult because there there were trespassing on the the tussle between the freedom of speech of parents to impose their views on children and the freedom of children to be educated without having erroneous views and we now know that in some cases it definitely is erroneous this is not a matter of opinion imposed upon them but youre not against teaching history and things like that oh heavens no no attractive her very keen on teaching history teaching literature very keen on teaching religion as a matter of fact I mean teaching about religion not indoctrinating in any particular religion because that good right against the spirit or critical thinking its a tricky one though isnt it because you cant build a society on the basis that you know youre right and you know that other people are wrong can you because the liberal society is we dont have to make that decision no thats your I decide yes you think and you decide what you think but you are really saying that they have to teach children have to be taught in your Creed well no no at night that there is a difference I mean let me use the example youve just used of the the but the burka ban thats a matter of opinion and theyre the society it seems to me has no right to impose on other people evolution is not a matter of opinion its a matter of fact the evidence is as overwhelming as in the case of oh that the Earth orbits the Sun thats not up  dispute you are in the camber as really I probably associated as being one of the most and I think the disparaging phrases militant atheists in the property um what do you think of that phrase what do you think of that accusation and do you if you like revel in that place or do you hate it when people try and if you like put you in the same category as fanatics on other sides of the religious well fanatics religious fanatics are apt to take the law into their own hands on occasion out there and actually threaten people actually use physical violence but you choose to go onto Twitter its not a scientific a venue  scientific debate you choose to go on Twitter just to take one example a tweet in which you drew a very invidious comparison between the number of Nobel Prizes won by people from Trinity College Cambridge and the entire Muslim population of the world Trinity code College Cambridge comes out on top on that of that comparison now not disputing the factual basis of it why make such an invidious comparison why raise that why raise the issue what is it whats the point of of drawing attention it is a fact that in the Dark Ages and Middle Ages the Islamic world was a beacon of scientific progress and enlightenment and something has gone wrong I had dinner with the then Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks a few months ago and learned there the astonishing fact that between 20 and 2 percent of all scientific Nobel Prizes have been won by Jews and I thought that was a stunning fact it really is I mean when you think of the total population of Jews in the world is is tiny compared to really any other of the major major religions so I I wanted to make this point that Islam has stagnated in the scientific field since them since the Middle Ages and the best comparison to make would have been with Jews and then I thought oh no I cant do that because that may really have upset people because of Palestine and Im very sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people in Israel so at the last minute I crossed out Jews and stuck in Trinity College Cambridge but I can think of much more gentlemanly ways of making the intellectual point that Islam has not being a great story country its just a fact whether or not it upsets people is less important to me than the dramatic nature of the fad which ought to be looked at somebody ought to be saying why but you would agree that you pick an argument with people of religion or religions dont make an argument suggest your way to say thing with the Sun pointed about that religion or those groups of people its a good point that the best way to convert people is not necessarily to tell them their ideas and I have occasionally seemed guilty of that  example I once wrote in  New York Times that anyone who doesnt believe in evolution is either ignorant stupid or insane now that sounds like an extreme point of view its actually a factual point of view because the word ignorant is not a disparaging word I make the rent of all sorts of things and so are you Im sure and we would be quite happy to own up to being ignorant of many things ignorant of  or ignorant of art or what even were to baseball whatever it might be I think a lot of moderate religious people are very turned off by your by your disco well some may be and thats thats a political that may be my political error there are technical error in terms because your job you see your role is trying to convert the world to your point of view I think I mean no I see I see my role as crying to try to persuade people to think  themselves and look at evidence thats I mean if they come round to my point of view as a result of looking at evidence then so much the better have you ever been wrong about anything important oh yeah give me  that what well Id have to go into sort of rather recondite scientific matters but Ive Ive been wrong on scientific questions and have said so scientists actually rather like being wrong its its its unlike politicians they get a sort of kudos from from admitting that theyre wrong because thats how science proceeds Richard Dawkins thank you thank you very much
1,0,"Of the last five pandemics the world has facednin about a century, four had multiple wavesnof infection outbreaks. In some cases the second or third wavesnturned out to be far more severe than the first. As governments around the world weigh the trade-offsnbetween reopening their economies and continuing lockdown restrictions,nwhat can we learn from history?  worst pandemic in modern history,nthe Spanish flu, which is estimated to have infectedna third of the world’s population, had three waves of infection.  first wave was in the spring of 1918,nwhile the second wave happened in autumn that year.  third wave occurred a few months later,nwhich lasted till the spring of 1919. You can see the pandemic peakednin the highly fatal second wave, which was responsiblen most of the deaths. Many health experts have saidnthat history may repeat itself.  World Health Organization has warned thatnthe worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is yet to come. But with widespread unemploymentnand many companies battling to stay afloat, there are calls to end the social restrictionsnand reopen the economy. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also lashed out atngovernment stay at home orders as “fascist”. And thats a feeling sharednby an increasing number of Americans. You heard Elon Musk’s comments.nI think that reflects a growing sentiment in this country where peoplenwant this to be over. So that is going to tug againstnwhat the governors have to do. y have tough decisions to face. However, many analysts have warnednagainst reopening the economy too soon, which may derail current eftsnto stem the crisis.  island of Hokkaidonin the northern part of Japan was ced back into a lockdown after a second wavenhit the region more severely than the first. Singapore, which was lauded nits early efts to stem the pandemic, also recorded a second wavenof infections in March, mainly from imported cases andnmigrant workers living in packed dormitories. A survey of more than 0nprominent economists in the U.S. found that 80% agreed easing severe lockdownnwhen infection risk remains high would lead to greaterneconomic damage. As the debate over when tonreopen the economy drags on, the Spanish flu offers some clues. In 1918, the U.S. had no coordinatednpandemic plans at a federal level. It was theree leftnto local authorities to decide how and when to intervenento prevent the spread of the disease.  social distancing measures over a century agonare similar to the modern-day restrictions such as the closure of schools, officesnand the banning of mass gatherings. Because tackling the infection spreadnwas orchestrated at a local level, the interventions varied widely.nThis led to the mortality rates and the pace of economic recovery differingnfrom city to city at the end of the pandemic. In 1917, a year bee the Spanish flu outbreak,nPhiladelphia and St. Louis had very similar mortality rates from influenza and pneumonia.nHowever, when the pandemic broke a year later, the two cities had very different approachesnto tackling the outbreak. Philadelphia was very latento implement social restrictions and even allowed a large street paradeninvolving some 200,000 people to go ahead in thenmiddle of the outbreak. Three days after the parade, every bed was fillednin Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals. In contrast, St. Louis officials intervened quickly,nresulting in a much lower death rate.  evidence also shows that cities whichnintervened sooner and more decisively saw their economies grow fasternafter the pandemic was over. For instance, this graph shows how citiesnwith stricter social distancing measures recovered fasternone year after the 1918 pandemic. However, cities in red, with more lenient measuresngenerally permed worse. In cities that implemented social distancing measuresnquickly and  longer, manufacturing activity and banking assets also sawnincreased growth a year after the pandemic was over.  evidence suggests thatnaggressive social distancing measures not only reduced mortality ratesnbut were also economically beneficial. While there are important economic lessonsnto be learnt from the Spanish flu of 1918, it’s difficult to compare that pandemic,nwhich occurred more than a hundred years ago, with the coronavirus pandemic of today.nAdvances in technology, global supply chains, the larger role of services and better communicationntools may ease the economic fallout significantly, which limits direct comparisonsnbetween the two pandemics. However, the evidence does implynthat decisive social restrictions to reduce the severity of a pandemic playsna key role in the economic recovery process. So how can both livelihoodsnand lives be saved? While there are no easy answers,nrevisiting the past offers a glimpse into the future. After all, a healthy economy doesn’t happennwithout a healthy population. Hi guys.nThanks  watching our video.

2,0,"Oh, thank you Fairey Thank you Thank you. Very fine. Thank you  their spontaneous. Welcome. Thats very much appreciated So this evening we have a wonderful time wonderful time are we going to be talking about its Kept us in about humanism and rationality and some of the things are happening in the world today and hopefully some jokes as well What more what more could you ask  so Im going to ask you to give a very warm welcome to our first speaker Please welcome all the weight flown a long way to be here to be with us this evening Robin blunder Hello Hello everyone. Welcome to the 17th Richard Dawkins award celebration. My name is Robyn bellum nur Im the CEO of the   inquiry and executive director of the Richard Dawkins foundation  reason and science in the US Now these organizations have recently merged our shared mission is to promote the separation of church and state the rights of non-believers and atheists around the world and the end to pseudoscience wherever that arises so Thank you So with equal vigor we fight against the regressive ces of the religious, right and the anti science anti-vaccination movement on the Left we We stand against those who would defraud the gullible with their nonsense claims of Communing with the dead and psychic powers and we fight against the industry that markets worthless alternative medicine such as Homeopathy and I understand your Prince Charles could use a talking to about that Which would one of you do that  me, please? So if theyre at the   inquiry and the Richard Dawkins foundation Our job is to engage peoples rational faculties. We hold religious dogma up to scrutiny Which is where it goes to die We reject superstition because its bollocks. I know your word and As a natural consequence of all of this we bring people to atheism Now making people into atheists is not particularly easy in the United States I mean, were a highly religious country and of course We dont have the great tool  doing that that you have in Great Britain the Church of England So tonight tonight is a celebration of critical thinking at its most brilliant and witty Richard Dawkins, Ricky Ricky Gervais and Richard Weissman are among the worlds greatest living ambassadors of reason in science And its pretty history-making to have them all onstage together Tonight the amazing Ricky Gervais swill join the ranks of other Richard Dawkins Award winners Including people like Bill Maher and ayaan Hirsi Ali and your own Christopher Hitchens and Stephen Fry What these extraordinary Award winners have in common is their Ill have to look at the table later What they all have in common is their willingness to slay mythologys that people cling to it ad evidence and As a result each has helped to advance human progress and humanist values Now some people see religion as a benign ce or even a ce  good but because its not true it has to use techniques other than logic and Human reason to keep a grip on its adherents and this plays out in highly destructive ways around the world In the rejection of science because ideas like evolution are at odds with the biblical account of creation in groundless and irrational dogmas finding their way into law resulting in the discrimination against LGBTQ people and limits on womens reproductive freedom and this is all bad enough in countries with a Judeo-christianity background, but in Muslim countries, theres an even heightened epidemic of bad effects in 13 countries of the world atheism is a capital offense You can be put to death  non belief So one of the programs of the Richard Dawkins Foundation and the   inquiry is called secular rescue and as the name implies It rescues people around the world who are risk from simply being an atheist or criticizing religion We have literally helped dozens of atheists leave their homes and find safety reby escaping prison mob violence and even death and another intellectual lifeline Around the world is through our translations project We provide access to the books of Richard Dawkins Translated into languages dominant in the Muslim world And they are offered as a free download. So that means native speakers in Arabic Urdu Indonesian and Farsi can now obtain  God Delusion and Richards books on evolutionary biology with a click of a mouse We know we know that an earlier copy of  God Delusion Translated into Arabic. That was a bootleg copy Has been downloaded more than 13 million times and three million of those in Saudi Arabia alone So At the Richard Dawkins foundation were bringing the truth of science to places where thats heretical and we are bringing a religious doubt to places where such such questions are treasonous and despite the odds This is a hopeful endeavor We are spreading the Enlightenment values and we are unleashing the power of human reason So, please consider joining our efts supporting our efts by becoming a member You know the famed mathematician and evolutionary biologist JBS Haldane said quote re is no great invention from fire to flying Which has not been hailed as an insult to some God So tonight I say let the insults begin. Thank you Fantastic class Thank You, Robin Tonight obviously, were here to celebrate the 2019 Richard Dawkins award And I mean, its absolute pleasure to introduce somebody who has never received that award Please welcome Richard Dawkins Im sorry to say I hadnt seen any of Rickys wonderful shows and I met him  the first time it was backstage in a London theatre where the comedian Robin intz had organised an Alternative Christmas a Christmas  atheists. I Was one of the many permers and Robin had lined up some really big names as well including Ricky Gervais as one of the star turns I Was astounded by the audacity of his act It reminded me of a New York Times review of Tom Lehrer that wonderfully witty American songwriter and permer the New York Times said Mr. Laras Muse is not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste Well Rickys act was like that only more so I found his script literally shocking and I dont shock easily Naturally this drew Me to him How I asked him did you get away with it? He admitted that he was using the Atheist audience as a testbed to try out ideas and see just how far he could go Bee subjecting a real audience to a more generally acceptable version. He was he was pushing the envelope numbers rephrased that he was using the Atheist audience to reach way outside the envelope In order to calibrate where the bounds might be  an ordinary there. I say less interesting audience. I Next met Ricky when I interviewed him  one of my channel  Documentaries we pretty much agreed about everything Some people think that makes  bad television Its not exciting the public want disagreement Well, Ive never thought that agreement can be interesting as well as verbal fisticuffs It doesnt have to be tame and bland and I need hardly say theres nothing tame or bland about Ricky Gervais his comedy Equally gives offense not least in his splendidly irreverent takedowns of Hollywood celebs in his presentations of the Golden Globe and Things like that if there was a Golden Globe  seeing how far you can go and just getting away with it Ricky would win hands down And hes so witty and entertaining with it More recently. Ive been watched his various drama series  Office Derek extras afterlife And what Ive learned is that Hes a truly great playwright and actor as well as a stand-up comedian  character of David Brent in the office is so sensitively written I found the embarrassment of it too near the bone always couldnt bear to go on watching like Like 8 hours, but I also admire Perhaps my favorite of all his shows is Derek where Ricky plays a supremely kind and gentle half-wit its Its a piece of acting genius, but he also shows his writing genius as  afterlife It almost had me in tears. Its so movingly clever Ricky is not just a stand-up comedian. Not just a great comic actor. Hes an outstandingly creative writer as well Like Woody Allen except Ricky is capable of playing more than one character Im going to end my acclamation of this witty hero of Atheism and reason with a long series of quotations from him because I think theyre so wonderful on life and death Its a strange myth that atheists have nothing to live  its the opposite We have nothing to die  we have everything to live  Its amazing life theres so much to live  as  death they said Thats the best thing about being dead. You dont know about it. Its like being stupid. Its only painful  others  doctrine of hell is one of the most evil things about both Christianity and Islam at least it is to the extent that people really believe it but as Ricky points out a Christian telling an atheist theyre going to hell is as scary as a child telling an adult. yre not getting any presents from Santa Another wonderful Sallie remember if you dont sin Jesus died  nothing On morality and the absurd myths that you need religion to be good Do unto others is a good rule of some I live by that Forgiveness is probably the greatest virtue there is but thats exactly what it is a virtue. Not just a Christian virtue No, one owns being good. Im good. I just dont believe Ill be rewarded  it in heaven My reward is here and now its knowing that I try to do the right thing that I lived a good life and thats where spirituality really lost its way when it became a stick to beat people with do this or you will burn in hell you Wont burn in hell, but be nice anyway And one of the nice what are the things that youll notice about Ricky if you follow him on Twitter,  example Hes how nice he is is he can be cutting in his wit? And he can of course give a fence but he has a wonderful gentle side as well Frequently to non-human animals, but to human animals as well when asked once whether he believed in God his reply was I believe in dogs? as  Twitter itself I can strongly emphasize with this Arguing with morons on Twitter. Hes like correcting graffiti on a public toilet wall that youll never need to use again. I Read that Ricky had an early ambition to be a scientist and his attitude to science seems to me exactly right Of course, he wouldnt claim to be a scientist to quote him Science seeks the truth and it does not discriminate  better or worse. It finds things out Science is humble. It knows what it knows and it knows what it doesnt know It bases its conclusions and beliefs on hard evidence Evidence that is constantly updated and upgraded It doesnt get offended when new facts come along. It embraces the body of knowledge It doesnt hold on to medieval practices because they are traditional and  following seems to me to show an admirably a scientific attitude to theology  existence of God is not subjective He either exists or he doesnt its not a matter of opinion. You can have your own opinions, but you cant have your own facts Ricky is immensely famous, of course, and hes very gracious about being stopped in the street and other aspects of Fame But being famous also prompted are typically witty Remark on the subject of the widespread belief that only religious people are moral Being famous is like believing in God Someones watching you all the time Ive never quite known how to cope with the retort that its only Extremists who get a religion a bad name Rickys answer to that at least hits one nail on the head You can easily spot any religion of peace. Its extremist members would be extremely peaceful Literary scholars have sometimes pointed out how fine can be the line between tragedy and comedy? Some of the greatest comedians and comic characters have been close to crotchety Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton, Tony Hancock Falstaff Basil Fawlty Ricky Gervais is one of the worlds great comedians, but unlike some comedians. Hes not himself a tragic figure. Hes a happy man with an endearing smile a laughing court jester in a dark time He uses humor to lift us all out of despond Other comedians may do that in Escapist way making us laugh as a way of running away from the dark reality of life Ricky doesnt do that on the contrary he goes right to the heart of the darkness tackles the evils of life and the evil people by confronting them head-on and Laughing at them as he himself said if you cant joke about the most horrendous things in the world Whats the point of jokes? Whats the point in having humor humor is to get us over terrible things Ladies and gentlemen atheists and rationalists I give you a great hero of our movement our own wittily creative infectiously laughing court jester ricky gervais Fantastic I can take that back from you. I directly I sit down thats it Now Richard digits you have been all in black that would look really amazing trick I think you do have the power of your mind. That was amazing So were going to chat about Im gonna start off picking up on one of the topics you mentioned there Which is I think many people in the public atheists of this Reputation  being a little bit down in the world and a little bit pessimistic Are you I mean, were living in quite a difficult time in the moment. I are you optimistic people. Are you optimistic about the future? well I dont know Im happy. Ive always been happy Ive been at I have I was Ive always tried to get the most out of life It was I I worked out early on that. That was the shortcut. I wanted. I just wanted to be happy I did that first and then decided how I was going to sort of make a living am I optimistic I Mean Ive got nothing to fear I look at this Bit like a holiday. We dont exist  thirteen and a half billion years n we exist  80 90 100 years if were lucky and you experience everything its amazing I mean Its amazing to be alive the chances of us being here as us that sperm hitting that egg is four hundred trillion to one Its incredible that were here, you know, and then we die never to exist again, you know And then some people even get offended by me saying that they that they say things like Im You dont know that Ill probably live again are you know some summer said on Twitter once to me? Why dont you pray just in case theres a god? And I said, why dont you put garlic over your door just in case theres a Dracula Ive got Ive got no problem with with praying, you know, Id you know, I It doesnt bother me  Ive never been bothered by spirituality I dont believe in it, but its I never a personal belief has never been a danger Um, I was so religion is something else and not even just religion But Dogma dogmas that is the dangerous bit and it just really exist in religion it exists in more and more places now that cultism that that which shouldnt be questioned anything that You know, thats thats what you want a question. If someone says you shouldnt question this though Youve got youve got to question it youve got That Sort experiment about the improbability of being here and all indeed the chance of one sperm eating one egg Yeah, and I love to quote a poem by Aldous Huxley. I think its called fist philosopher song and it goes a million million spermatozoa All of them alive out of their Cataclysm, but one poor noah dare Hope to survive and all that billion minus one might have chanced to be shakespeare another newton a new done But the one was me Shame to have ousted your betters thus taking arc when the others remained outside Better  all of us fraud homunculus if youd quietly died Thats great But I mean, I Think realistically we probably have to be pessimistic But thats no way to live a life. I think youve got to be optimistic Otherwise is that you youre not gonna have any chance of changing things to make them better So I say Im realistically a pessimist but I live my life as an optimist And like really Im happy. Yeah, and I dont think its and I think you if I get it right your question is geared to Either are we are we worried about not exist again, or are we worried about how where the worlds going? Well, theres not a lot we can do about it. Either way, you know, its not a choice Is that are you gonna die or live? Probably I just live ever Which I probably wouldnt choose or I would then regret it I think the first million years Id really be kicking myself Ive got Why I choose infinity res no way how I quite absolutely agree with that whats frightening about death is not death itself Its infinity. Its its eternity. Yeah, I want to spend eternity under a general anesthetic Yes gonna happen exactly. Yeah Oh, yeah and Bentham, you know We dont know we dont know but I imagine its like the thirteen and a half Billion years bee we were born and that was fine Well, um, bee we started I did put on Twitter a a call  questions Regarding in some yeah their needs. How are you asking  it? Well, the first question was to Richard actually, which is about Charles Darwin Created the theory of evolution. How did animals change bee that? So thats not thats a joke Thats a joke, isnt it that you may better Ill make that one up I know though, yep, but listen, okay That is a joke, but its no more stupid than some real one Okay, the the the the one that obviously everyone gets and I used to be frivolous and I used to do not now I just answer him seriously. Um if we evolved from apes Why are there still Apes around I used to say things like well If god made man from dust, why is there still dust around and things that you know? but now I say well we didnt evolve from modern age we evolved with modern Apes from a common ancestor rather like and I just answer it deadly deadly serious like they You know, it doesnt help Someone someone followed it up with Well, Ive been that that go into the same zoo  twenty four years and I havent seen one monkey turn into a person But I think I think even though thats incredibly stupid We think actually it shows what the problem is when people try and understand it y cant grasp the scale of it. y cant imagine these tiny changes. No one can imagine fifty million years So they do expect them to the chimp to go. Come on lad And thats because they also give it a will y think they think even non-religious people are trying to understand you. y try and think that the the giraffe was Really stretching his neck, you know Thats the problem. res lots of little logical problems that hasnt been explained properly But actually its if I can understand it anyone can you know and Richard you must have been asked many? Stupid questions over the years. Is there a standout stupid question  you? Yes Well, the one that really just mentioned but theres also why did we ever see a Crocodoc? What thats a good question great question, I would love that I would love a car Ive actually got a Crocodoc toy that somebody gave me What image have you got in mind  a Crocodoc a Crocodoc would be a crocodile that we angry but hes fucked because he just got a bill Thats like my time Implication of that is that there should be an intermediate between every animal and every other animal. I think there should be that way You can get crocodile. Well, I cut they they they cant see that its nearly an analogue thing as well and and I think youve spoken at least bee youre youre amazing model about if you took a picture of your dad and your Grandparents and their dad you at any one point you go. y look alike, but at some point is a fish You know Eventually, theres a fish. I didnt see that coming what you did do you sued you know, it says that they again its the best the scale the scale is is unimaginable, its lucky that it did happen because we couldnt imagine it if it wasnt fact we couldnt make that up because its Incredible its incredible. Its probably true But whenever Ive done that it always gets a gasp of astonishment why I mean everybody knows were descended from fish Yeah, well the way I put it is them if you could meet your two hundred million greats grandfather You would eat him with a slice of lemon and tartar sauce. Yes, exactly yeah, yeah, I Split it is there is the scale though, isnt it? And then is it true? Were closer. I know I know closer Is it a non-scientific term, but Id like these facts as well that go around that were evolutionary speaking I think they mean in time were closer To a salmon than a salmon is to a shark Respectable thing to say about yeah, nothing wrong with that. All it means is that we are close to cousins That means to say that the common ancestor that we share with salmon lived a lot more recently than the common ancestor that salmon Yes, sure Yeah, so it is a Crocodoc possible Okay, listen let me RTR take this Im a psychologist. So I mean I can answer this Is that a possibility in a parallel universe? Oh, here we go I Did a podcast with Lawrence Krauss and he was definitely saying things that I had to just wind me up just when I started Understanding it. Hed throw in something else. I got why are you doing that? Well, it is true that when duckbill platypuses were first Sent back to the museum here Nobody believed they were real. y thought it was a hoax. y thought that somebody had taken a ducks bill and sent onto Some other kind of kind of creature so I suppose thats the nearest approach to a Crocker duck and that is real Because its only monotreme that it produces eggs and milk. It could make its own custard It doesnt but it Could I use the instant stuff so it could use that as well together whisk it will be fine. Yes. It is amazing. I mean Some Australian mammals. Its because is it true that? It floated away and there werent predators as such so and there were predators ually, they didnt they they most had gone extinct. re was a giant Predatory carnivorous kangaroo  example mustve been quite terrifying bounding after you with its jaws a gape. Yeah We should bring them back yeah, I think so. Yes. Can we now now you Started it but not into an idiot on Twitter. No, can we bring back the mammoths, you know cant we? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome  greatest thing ever can we can we bring back the mammoths there is a serious possibility  genome of the mammoths is being pretty much worked out and  technology to actually bring it back is isnt there yet? Weve got the genome and so it doesnt seem totally impossible that you could now. What does that mean? Do you mean youve synthesized something or youve put together bits of day-night or the DNA exists? And youve you found in the elephant and modified it. What does it mean? Weve got the weve got the well mean youve got the thing that would Make a mammoth if it was well, because frozen mammoths died sufficiently recently and theyre frozen in in the Arctic so that theres plenty of Tissue there. You can get plenty of DNA res a lovely Hilaire Belloc poem about the frozen mammoths which ends up I Cant remember how it goes, but its the skin beat you it fit will make an excellent soup But the snag is if the skin be but punctured bee it is boiled Your conception is wholly and utterly spoiled and hence on account of the size of the beast  dainty is nearly unknown. But anyway, there it is. Its its if you dont know the answer Richard just say so Right, you asked to this its So high, you know you how would we bring it back? How could how what is the process? What would we do the process is that you use the you use the soft tissues of this frozen mammoth? Sequence the DNA and thats pretty much been done with a little bit of filling in with the elephant DNA as well Now what we dont yet have the ability to do is to implant that DNA into an elephant egg Right, then put the elephant egg into a put the elephant egg with mammoth DNA Into a female elephant and then grow the embryo so itd be it would be a hybrid Mostly no. No. No, how would you how could you see? Oh, so youd clone? Oh youd cloned the Dolly the sheep. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it would be that kind of thing so dolly had it was a sheep egg and into that sheep egg was it was put the DNA of another sheep, right? And so and then If a mammoth baby come out wouldnt that surprise the elephant? No doubt. Yes, no doubt. A lot of people have hairy babies And fast and everything like Elephants have got tasks. Ostrich is just hairier than this. Yeah, if if you could Clone a mammoth Would you do it not clubbing would you would you? I would but there are many who wouldnt there are many think it would be unethical somehow to do this. y think It would be um cruel Why would it be cruel because it wouldnt ever be in its natural habitat. Well If you made lots of them, theres some people think that we should actually clone, lots of them and let them loose on them on the Siberian tundra - to him, you know bring back the ecology that Id bring back Tyrannosaurus Rex I let it loose in parts of England to be honest Would you do if you could if you were part of the committee deciding whether to bring back a mammoth, how would you vote I Dont know why I would I would I would I be doing it just cuz I could Because thats summoned to be said He what he what I Dont know what Yeah, yes. I dont know about Im not Im not certain the answer I was a lot more comtable. We talking about Crocodoc slow. Ill give you that so Okay, so well move it. Im the away from mammoths n and crocodiles D So atheism. Yeah, so I can remember I dont know if this has any resonance  YouTube I can remember listening to you on the radio. I cant place this I know its a long time ago and I would think its after  initial success of the office I think and I think its Steve right? I might be wrong and he said something like Oh, you must wake up in the morning and say thank God  my amazing things that are happening And you said why would I say thank God. Im an atheist right? And it was the first time Id heard the word atheist Im kind of public radio well, I mean yeah, there shouldnt even be the word should there if people didnt invent gods I wouldnt have to deny them and its just Its like I I was told when I sort of started breaking America to not mention, I was Nathan really first thing I did on everybody First thing I did why what what am I gonna do imagine? Imagine not doing something because people hate you because of what you are. Thats thats you know Thats my only thing Ive got Im a white rich middle class man, but Im at least Im hated  being an atheist you know, I mean Im oppressed I have oppressed in 13 countries. Id never go to anyway Have you seen the change in your of the last 20 years or so about how Atheism is perceived. Well, I mean you sort of do it I res part of me that does it because I think I should that there is someone being persecuted now that might you know I cant I cant change the world But what I mean? maybe someone in a Western world that thinks they shouldnt come out because its a bad thing because Its still a bad thing in Western society in America they took about up America right the but probably that big bit in the middle of America, but We were voted least trustworthy group joint bottom with rapists So theres still a thing about I better not say Im an atheist that are annoying my mom or dad or granddad or school res still that so you do that some of that I do it as an intellectual pursuit because someone asked me a question Id rather give the right answer than the wrong answer Id rather tell the truth than lie because its easier, you know, I think the ability people think I run into churches and go Its all fucking bollocks. I die. I Dont I dont care, you know, I dont But if Im asked if I believe in God, Ill say no. I mean, you know the tricky one is some I Did a film called the invention of lying where I did a scene where my thank you seven people saw that film Where my mother in that is dying and its because Im the only person in the society can lie She says I I dont want to go to nothingness and I go theres not nothing This is a beautiful place you go. And youre young again and I invent heaven right and That comes from a fact that when my mum was dying, I did face dilemma If shed have said you think theres a god thats thats a personal thing and thats a you know, um So yeah, I am I I try I just try and be honest, really and the other is if if someone elses kid five-year-old asked me do I believe in God I Sort of think. What should I say here? And I say well I dont but a lot of people do what do you think? you know I try and I theres still a a Diploma is not its not always my place. You dont you know, I mean Id But you know my house my rules if someone asks me someone Twitter, I turn the truth  last 20 30 years have you seen that a change in how atheism and is is perceived? Im not just sociologist I havent done the research. Im not a psychologist. So I Not sure would only be a subjective impression  statistics suggest that we are growing in numbers Obviously in Western Europe But also even in America I think the number of people who claim no religion in the United States is now more than twenty percent Which is large compared to any particular Religious denomination. So I think that the the statistics show that the trend is in the right direction, but as Ricky says other polls show that were done down there with rapists in in Terms of public. I think I have to lump us in with You know Agnostics which again? I keep trying to explain that on Twitter that theyre not mutually exclusive you know one deals with knowledge one deals with belief and so You know People say on Twitter to me over there. Its a logical to be an atheist You should be agnostic and I say well I am I am as well Agnostic see on your nerves a bit. Well No, because were all agnostic arent we we all dont a stick by definition if if we accept that no one knows Knowledge, you know, Im being very diplomatic here. But if we accept that no one knows that theres a god or not We might be wrong and weird 99% Sure no But lets say we we dont know were all agnostic. So take it out. It doesnt matter now. We ask about belief What do you believe whats your best bet when someone says theyre agnostic if there isnt it sort of attempting to go what do you just think about it a bit more than Because it well, I just think that theres a theres a yes But theres a category mistake some people do do it because they dont want to say they believe in God, you know But if you you shouldnt ask an agnostic if theres a God or not, you should ask them Do you believe theres a god or not? Because then they cant say I dont know because that doesnt make sense Well, you dont know whether you believe or not right, you know, so yeah, I I think the the really sick making thing is people who think because because theyre Agnostic, and we can we cant know  sure ree the likelihood is 0/0. Hmm. Yeah, very different I mean, its its you know, Im Im agnostic but I think but I believe that the likelihood is about 1 percent or less Yes Yes, if we accept that, we dont know if its a default. We dont know no ones come back from heaven No ones proved it you cant prove the non-existence of something and why would you the periodic table of non-existent things is infinite, you know, its like So if we accept that Thats thats a knowledge. Thats a category of knowledge. But if you just say, what do you believe? Yeah, you have to step up right you have to say what you believe and if you dont believe in any God Youre an atheist. Thats the other misconception people think that atheism is denying the existence of God Its not its just not accepting the claim that there is a God, you know if there were 3 doors which God exists God doesnt exist. I dont know that doesnt make sense res three doors. It says God exists. It doesnt exist I dont know you not knowing is irrelevant to where there is or isnt the god You can youve done a sleight-of-hand there on a category mistake because one is knowledge and to our beliefs, right what? Session no what? No. No, theres always it. Im saying 3 is always there if you had to choose one Yeah, its um, I but I believe res a god I dont believe theres a god. I dont know. Is it relevant then, isnt it? Crock adducts when So maybe wants my Twitter Twitter questions you spoke about lying there Whats the the biggest lie, youve told to impress somebody? is that a question thats been submitted  on Twitter the biggest lie youve told To impress somebody its quite a tricky question actually, ah the because Ive told to impress someone. Yeah, I Honestly cant think of one. Yeah Richard or something. Not only can I not think of one. Im quite confident. res never been one Youve never told a lie to impress anyone Ive told a lie - not hurt peoples fear. Thats different Yes, I suppose thats to impress them because I want them to like me by not saying so it might exact it So can you come to my party? I say no. I cant Im giving blood of the orphanage or something No, because I dont want to say of course, Im not coming to your party. I hate you and all your friends it would be so My lies are usually because I havent got the nerve to be honest when its someones findings. yre all white lies. Yeah, okay But I dont think Ive lied - like on a CV or something. I Didnt write the question Okay, there are three doors I believe in God I dont Um, I suppose that works if you say which answer sums you up most thats allowed I think what would the three doors? Yeah, there is no God. re is a God I dont know Id go  there is no God because Id want to identify With choosing that door, but theres still the category was saying because one deals with knowledge in one Now the category Maceda background in philosophy, of course your first degrees in philosophy is that my only degree okay Your last degree. Yeah, he made it sound really good Yes, degree a lie to impress exactly. Yeah, in fact my first degree was biology which I did  two weeks And then swapped a velocity there were nine oclock lectures it was 0 hours a week I suddenly got to university and thought I havent come here to learn. Ive come here to join a band do you not I mean and so thats a category our Philosophy was um, yeah, I did philosophy and I have you ever found that useful well Only that everything is is Useful that you look and he sort of dig well and thats not true. Is it really? I suppose Critical thinking is is useful But I think I already had it or I wouldnt have done science and philosophy So I dont know that issues  other than its nice to know stuff. Its fun I mean I took it as one of the best things about being alive Learning stuff. I want to know everything. Im still in awe of the world, honestly I wish this wasnt about me because Id be quizzing him. Hed get fed up. Hed go  fuck. Shut up Id be asking him questions all the time And If we turn to your your your work, but I mean fantasy. This is a question to both of you. I think whats interesting Is that your work is? Incredibly innovative. So if you take Selfish Gene or you take the God Delusion Its its a very its a very innovative work and God Delusion in particular I mean came out of a time when Atheism wasnt a popular thing to be writing about and you went  it the office I mean just phenomenal in particularly all of your work, but the office we just sort of focus on that. I Where do those ideas come from? What whats the process behind? Innovation in that well, its very different because Richards dealing in Whats true about the universe and Im making stuff up so so Im I wouldnt put myself alongside scientists but  me, its As I get older all I want to be in art in comedy. Whatever is just more honest and look deeper Thats all I want to do. Now. Thats all I try and do a my being Is this is me. First of all, its even done bee thats what you you dont want to do You want to keep going, you know, this is new but I do want to I am fascinated with honesty and bravery And something as lowly as comedy I think is that is that is that the best thing to and not without? consequence I I think people think that Sometimes youre just trying to offend  the sake of it. Thats too easy. That is too easy And I know many people say um, oh, yeah any anyone can just be offensive? Go on then So that on arena and be if it just be offensive see oh, you know, I mean its ridiculous thing to say So if thats never the aim but I am aware that some people will find everything I do offensive because everyones different but thats no reason why you shouldnt Shouldnt say it, you know Is a good thing about freedom of speech you have the right to piss off lots of people at once Is that your thoughts as well? And I think that the To say that offends me as though that was somehow an argument yeah is whats really pernicious and I think Stephen Fry said Youre offended well so fucking what yeah Yeah, and then Christopher Hitchens said slightly more moderately Youre offended Im still waiting to hear your argument But thats what it is. Thats what I offer people have found out now. Its sort of tit--tat and At some some of it was a rebellion against the first wave of political correctness where they said well if you cant do that Im offended by that now what you know, and it was it was but its another m of dogma Its another m of shutting you down putting the the suffix phobia on the end of somethings that means you cant discuss it anymore and Youve got to be very careful about that but particular in comedy Most offence is taken when people mistake the subject of a joke with the target y think that subject is a terrible contentious terrible thing to laugh about well never look at the joke though, you know And they dont they go now you shouldnt joke about so-and-so Ive been asked by journalists Is there anything you wont joke about and I say is there anything you werent right about go straight away. y assume a joke is Making fun of the terrible situation or the the victim or the and and and and I dont do that I actually dont do that which and its fine If you do, I think humor is exempt from those things But I still dont I still have a conscience when I and I try and make my jokes bulletproof now, of course, youve got a make and bulletproof  10 years time, which is a Which is a problem And is it a question of the audience Perceiving where its coming from in a sense that you know, if you were racist and you do racist material clue Thats a very ugly thing Yeah. No, I think thats the joke. Its work I think the actual what I mean is I think people you can do a joke about race and without being racist and I think thats I think people think that you mustnt do joke about race because they assume it might be they havent looked it and some people just they just it just scares people a little bit and some people are offended on other peoples perhaps you see people in the audience looking around thinking can I laugh or that maybe I shouldnt and even why and I Thats why I did in to boost up Jiggs because I want to say we you can laugh at this Look, heres an example of something you can laugh at and I give them examples and I I almost done I defied them not to laugh because Its okay to laugh at bad things. It is. Ok to valpha bad things, but youre not setting out to offend Im not setting out to offend and I think the targets are my joke of valid. I can defend every joke Ive ever made I could even argue that every jerk Ive ever made is politically correct, but that Thats another thats another man. But yeah, okay not that that matters because theres a difference between being correct and being politically correct and and its been mugged and changed and now its A different beast than it was, you know But now I think youre allowed to joke about anything. Its its what the joke actually is and sticking with your your work  the moment if there was a weird parallel universe where you could only Have written one book or only made one television series or tour film Which one would you be most happy with I? Would be most happy with the extended phenotype No surprise, which is which is the one book Ive written  a professional audience. Although I hope other people can read it as well How interesting Site, I thought you would you would go selfish gene or God Delusion. But oh youve written those as well just to remind you Im actually I admit pretty pleased with all my books here. I must admit but I I think though the one I Think perhaps the one where I made the most original contribution is the extended phenotype. I was quite agreeably surprised when you said you thought  God Delusion was You know Innovative, Im not sure its innovative Sorry, pull ropes and singing to me. Ive gotta stop Its my alarm clock reminding me to take my pills Yeah, I love poor Rosie do you need to take your pills because we can get on if this is gonna get good See I Think the God Delusion was enormous Lee I mean no one was doing books about atheism at that time As far as I can remember know that well not quite true. ually, Sam Harris was but And I think but but I mean theres really nothing in any of our books that thats not eshadow didnt say Bertrand Russell  why Im not a Christian and so on But then you mentioned  Selfish Gene I think that that is more in innovative actually and I think the extended phenotype is more so, okay Okay, Id probably go with the Old Testament Just because of how popular it was and how well it sold Um, you did phenomenally well with that Id be just think how rich I mean I could I do better marketing and Id do better deals Yeah, then those goat herders did Ill have a top US agent and yeah, I got a day young. I was listen to a Woody Allen routine Shes the vodka routine he said always my rabbis terrible my rabbis tell um Hes giving us sermon. He got the Ten Commandments listed the Seven Dwarfs that Was a great joke. Anyway, I digress so if I didnt allow you to agree that your work was with the Old Testament if you werent allowed to Lets go which of your TV series or films would you go? Well, I mean the office brings to mind again because it was the the first thing Id try my hardest at and you know So yeah It really Did you know the u.s. Office Id use Did you know from the the get-go with the office that youve got something very special there, um, yeah, I thought it was special I thought it was different. I sort of came to it the big list of sort of donts more than dos because you know you It was very late in life Id worked in an office  10 years and I think I was like 38 39. So I knew this was a you know a Second bite at the cherry, so I knew it had to be special and I was happy with that I could walk away knowing that Ive done something and is it true that when it was a exported to America? y got a different cast and oh Yeah, well We sold the rights  them to do it. Why didnt they just take your version? Because there was only 12 and I was too lazy to do any more And theres a thing over there. y want that syndications y want a hundred episodes of something and then the the money is exponential because it gets shown in Rotation and you know, so and they did three hundred and something episodes where your episodes shown as well yeah, but It was on  America And I think it was the it was the highest rated show on the channel and it got like a million and a half So the US office was getting 10 million a week and the Superbowl episode got 2 million Yes, so its a its a different beast. Its just a each episode We made ours  about 120 grand by the end that theres were three million in episode. Yeah Yeah, so its just its not even its not even to be compared. I look at it Like I sold my DNA but its not my yeah, its not my kidding I was rather shocked to discover that one of david attenboroughs really major series was Redone with an American voice with Oprah Winfrey instead of David Attenborough. I thought thats utter heresy. I mean but presumably She just literally overdubbed the footage she didnt go and remake it or with different No different. I think that Steve Carell as a spider Ya know they just started again just because Americans want things by Americans  Americans ours wouldnt have been big in the big middle bit You know, its it was and it was different. It was different. y did make it differently. It was more optimistic If it wasnt mine artistically, but it Honestly it it was much more lucrative  me than my version, you know, so Someone like someone on Twitter once sent me  US version of the office is better than yours. How does that make you feel and I sent back fuckin rich But that happens with TV, obviously Americans buy ideas and remake here it doesnt happen with books I mean if someone even American publishers, we love God Delusion. Were gonna get Sam Harris to do it. That wouldnt know me Thats true. But what they do is change the title Right. Its been irritating. Um Ive actually schooled mega Joons Either Ive actually Ive actually bought the same book twice. I didnt realize On one occasion, I thought it you know on Amazon it says if you like so-and-so you will probably like so-and-so Same book Fantastic algorithms correct, isnt it if you like that So, what would they change your titles did they Ive never allowed it? but many of my colleagues have had the title has changed, right and I find it unnecessary and Really have nuisance it Matt Ridley says its because the publishers like to feel important. Its the only thing they can do And so I assumed it was marketing like they wouldnt get that title author. And yeah, they call it marketing Yeah, they call him a heart. Yeah So We were chatting beehand or second with some friends and one of the the questions came up about comedy and the fact that we couldnt think of many if any comedians Who were religious? Nothing  example Im just saying is do we think its a thing that most stand-ups tend to be agnostic or atheist or I think so I think thats because a lot of comedians Are critical thinkers, I think a lot of them a science yre intelligent Well, I dont want to swell we ever. Yeah, but then, you know a lot of a lot of religious people are intelligence but theyve been theyve been got an early age and its like oh yeah, I think theyre braver some people theres still a thing of not saying Im an atheist cuz they because people think that its a Bad thing to be, you know parents still christen their kids because they think its a respectable thing to do, you know, I And I that thats sad, but I get it res a couple though theres a couple they dont put it in their act. I dont think a Tim Vine is very devout Yeah, yeah, but in general it they tend to be I think more Skeptical or I think thats because they are they look at things from all angles and they come up with funny ideas, and Im And I try I I look at the idea and I think thats that thats whats wrong and thats what Dogma does is that people try and give ideas human rights so you leave them alone and You you you you dont have to you can Ridicule ideas without her in anyone and some people say that deserves a round of . Oh, thank you And And they and they found it shut some people up if they say thats her you know you can be accused of racism or anything if you if you Criticize an idea and its people jumping in the way of a bullet and saying why are you shooting at me? And It comes back to Richards point that Im offended Thats not an argument. Its not an argument. Its like me being offended if someone takes the mickey out of maths its like Go on yeah fine. Yeah, dude, I mean Because you can laugh at math it doesnt it doesnt affect maths it doesnt affect math And And I like asking this of all permers when you Youve done a lot of live work when you go onstage or bee you onstage. Do you have any superstitious rituals that you carry out? No No, Im not superstitious am I Is this a trick? No that if I said yes, Id go down a vault Look at this footage and deny it no Really? No. I have I probably have loads of Sort of neuroses and OH CDs and things out but nothing based on superstition. Its some Worrying that the audience in is that what it was the air conditioning like is it someone as theres squeaky door whos good? No ice in the drinks someones putting off. res someone you know, and I have all those things but I have no superstitions no, what did you mean superstitions or do you mean I mean some permers touchwood to wear certain socks or Nothing. I wear the same clothes because I cant be bothered to think about what else to wear. But I Dont do touchwood. Okay. Um, no, I dont know I Dont know I dont know I just I burn some incense say a couple of prayers Thats it really and in terms of changing minds in terms of getting people to be more skeptical or rational or scientific both of you enormous ly Influential but with with two different ways obviously yours using comedy a lot at the time and youre depending more on factual Arguments, how does that play out is is that plain to the same audiences do you think is equally persuasive? Well, I think which is more driven in his What what do you think about changing minds what do you think Im known to be not very good at it I tend to just as he was saying earlier Ricky just I tend to just tell the truth and That isnt always the right way to go about it marketing wouldnt approve I suspect of just simply going out and telling the truth. I had a rather nice encounter with neil degrasse. Tyson, who? who said something like You just put it out there. You dont theres theres no act of Persuasion. res no act of seduction going on. You just you just seem to say here are the facts take it or leave it and I had to say I Said I gratefully accept the rebuke But I then went on to say Im not the worst with that and I quoted Alan Anderson, who was then the editor of New Scientist Who said I asked him what your policy is at New Scientist and he said our policy of New Scientist is science is interesting And if you dont agree you can fuck off. Yeah Thats exactly yeah Yeah, I dont I dont I do Of things there there are probably worse things than people believing in all the different gods It doesnt affect me because Im because Im free and liberated in and safe and But yeah You can still be annoyed. Its ignorance that annoys me more than anything. Whatever it is. Its not I dont want to keep going after Religion because thats only one m of this belligerent Willful and and its not even that its you. You cant sort of help what you believe in. Most people arent going around Thinking this llinois people. Im trying to oppress peoples rights. y just think I believe in God because thats how thats how my brain worked when I was little and now I I think is probably a God and most religious people Arent crazy Its something else again. Its something you know and We worry about the people who believe the bad bits in their holy book as well as the good bits Most nice people who believe in God they can tell the difference y do they know the nicer if they cherry pick and they know the nice bits from the bad bits y dont do the bad bits and my point is if you know the bad bits from the good bits You dont need the holy book, you know, youre already a moral person And with afterlife which I think is phenomenal thank you, um Clearly obviously you talk about a theism in there But its fundamentally about kindness and living a good life. I I think I think it is I think the question is When you when you lose the best thing about life, is it still worth living? Thats that thats what the question starts with this started with a high concept really imagine You lost everything you wouldnt care about anything you do what you wanted. So that was the comedic Where did that thought come from? I dont know. I dont know. I think it might have been Sort of two years of This thing that youve got to watch what you say Like it, wasnt it? It wasnt to say the right thing It was to say the thing that was least offensive to most people which is nonsense. Wed still be in the Middle Ages Wed still be putting leeches down our pants, you know Every every scientist committed heresy at some point every great invention every move ward in progress was going against some sort of crazy dogma at some point and and And it wasnt that there was more Crazy mad nasty people around it was that they werent ashamed of it anymore in the last few years, you know In my day racist were ashamed Not so and That and the backlash was some people saying oh you cant say anything and I just thought what imagine if you could You just could you didnt care about the consequences? You wouldnt didnt care about offending anyone because that we do we we Even myself and Richard who want to tell the truth We do things we dont want to do all the time because just because were worried about if were mugged we hand over the cash Because we dont want to get hurt But imagine if you didnt care about living or dying that happens in afterlife. He thinks bring it on. Im not scared anymore So that was the idea if you werent scared about consequence if you werent scared about politeness if you werent You had nothing to lose and that was the seed of the idea really? But then of course it becomes about kindness if it becomes becoming about people trying to save you theres the comt of strangers and the people who care and them and thats the thing about like Grieving and depression the thing that came out of after I thought would shocked me Ive never had a reaction like it even the office. Ive never had a reaction like it because it was an emotional reaction and I found out that people come up to me all the time and they say oh I lost my mother I lost my husband and you think oh, yeah, of course. Everyones grieving. Everyones grieving this year about something and the older they get the more that happens and and that was never an intention, but I think it I Think people hadnt seen certainly a comedy, but they hadnt seen Something that doubt with grief that man he was just he wanted to die and then I had to make it funny so Yeah, but also his character is dealing with grief not from a religious point of view at all well, I wanted that I wanted a bit of a play on words with afterlife like he thought his life was over and He doesnt really it doesnt even believe in an afterlife. He hasnt even got that comt so whats the point and and I went down to sort of a nihilist road and I I Wanted to bring him out to say well this to the point. Weve still got a few years to enjoy everything else Thats the that was the sort of philosophical question So to answer your original question, I think I am quite positive and I think I am quite optimistic Im an optimistic person. I think itd be all right, you know, I think it would be all right If theres a meteor heading towards Earth Five billion people are pray to their God and a few hundred scientists to get Bruce Willis up there And you talk about the impact I think again this is true of both of you  impact on peoples lives that if you say people after life thats has a resonance with people well I think people want to see things that they havent seen bee and I think this is what happens with Marketing and people who are worried. I think everyone sets out with these good intentions Im going to do an Uncompromised thing about something theyre going to say that its never been said bee and then soon someone says if you take out a couple of the swear words we could put on a nine oclock if you change that to so-and-so and we might and then soon theyve Thats its watered down and its a you know I remember once I was One of my first things at channel  11 oclock show and I did the sketch it was about there was think about people who claimed benefit when they didnt need it and I played this sort of sort of bigoted crazy right-wing journalist who it would always come down on the wrong side, right and and he was saying my carrot was sort of saying then what you should do is right if if someone you know, um Claims their death set off a fire alarm and see if they run out of the building, right? So it was all that sort of stuff  four said can you change that to the blind because the Deaf are very militant So their moral judgment was how many letters theyd have to write also It doesnt work if hes blind because he can hear the fucking Bell. I Wonder why they care about getting letters actually Ive often wondered that because that way people think that one one camp now is worse than the worst now now people are terrified of one complaint and now you know how to rap splitting the , you know Ive You know talked people down like Executives  saying Ill write the letters. Sometimes they want to know Ive explained the joke why its okay and theyre okay never complain Ive never had if I were to complain its never been upheld, you know because if you can if youre clever enough You can its not just putting stuff out there and trying to offend everyone its you know You can explain it. Some people just want to be heard. I Were in my normal job people would complain Id call them back and they go. Oh didnt think youd call back. y were already happy That you called them back Some people want to be heard because theyre never heard and then people are scared Ive been playing these days and theres no reason  it but with with afterlife How does it? Feel to to get that feedback from people that its much more emotional people saying that that touch me that has resonance. Its great Its really good. I feel very proud of that because some its just I suppose its just another little layer to it and And Id certainly rather that than I Hated it. I was offended. You know, I dont I dont want people to hate things how to and be offended I want them to enjoy it. You know, Im a comedian Im not a politician or a you know, a religious leader or I put stuff out there cuz I think theyll enjoy it and And pay me And Richard up see your books have had enormous influence on on peoples lives. How does that feel? Well, I do very much appreciate getting letters from people who say youve changed my life and I get a a fair number of those I Get an enormous number who say that my books on evolution Decided them to go into science at school and only this week I was seeing a doctor and he and Australian doctor in the hospital and he said At the end. I want to thank you  Selfish Gene was what made me take up Biology and hence made me become a doctor. I love that. I mean that thats really a wonderful wonderful And perhaps more thats more relevant to this meeting  God Delusion enormous numbers of letters from people who say you saved me from my religious upbringing You you you you articulated something that I that I felt myself but could never quite find the words to just to say Myself. I am no longer. I realize free from the shackles of religion and and that I find again hugely gratifying there are many who say re are many who write in great distress because they have lost their faith and are unable to break the news to their parents or their spouse and in particularly poignant are the Clergy people whove there weve got a project in America called the clergy project which is designed to help clergy people clergymen and clergy women who become atheists and cant escape because its the only living they know and So thats poignant When they when theyre theyre stuck they can only earn their living by by going on preaching sermons and things like that. So the clergy project Does that and I like to think that maybe I help them as well people who who need to escape? And find it very difficult. I think thats I I think thats really important and it comes back the point we made earlier Ideas not having human rights because I think people think when we criticize religion were criticizing people who are religious Which is couldnt be further  the truth because we think theyre victims too Absolutely. I mean the word Islamophobia is all about that Its a fear it people think that if you criticize Islam youre criticizing Muslims quite the contrary. yre the primary victims of Islam. Well, We are were almost out of time But just bee we finish up here just to turn our attention to the future you have amazing pieces of work Carried out. What? What direction do you see yourself going in the future? downhill Just just seriously, its just just awful Yeah, Ive got a bad back. I wake up. I just like my knees have gone I Dont know. Its whats the point really? I just I Want to be a wet. When when have we got the head in a jar? Thats when I thats where Im on a skateboard me in a jar on a on a hoverboard Whizzing round 200 years old right. I want to do more afterlife. Im starting filming next week actually afterwards here Im gonna do follow-up to humanity next year with them super nature So and then I dont know just get drunk Thank you so much  your Sharing insights know anybody isnt about you your work and that the offender being a crooked duck and bee I I think My two guests properly theres some other things to be done Which is Simon who is in charge of the this wonderful venue the Troxy here has given us the help the venue Out of here. Oh I Just say Ive knocked over a glass of water Im not see wet myself on stage Absolutely clear. No, okay. Um, we have a real rock and roll death if you electrocute yourself Des pride and Chris French from the skeptic who have organized the event this evening And the   inquiry and of course the Richard Dawkins foundation again  our helping to organize and sort out the events But most of all my two wonderful guests it felt like a very special evening I think youll agree and Congratulations on the award lovely. Thank you very much does the air So we knew Richard Dawkins  fucks sake Richard will be signing books afterwards, but I think youll agree a Fantastic and unique evening legend. Please give a huge round of   two wonderful guests two amazing people Richard Dawkins Ricky debate Thank you so much. Thank you How did I save me tonight? You"
3,0,"Im the attorney first CFI and Im the person privileged to sit here between these two gentlemen and provide a brief introduction bee the conversation and I fully appreciate none of you are here to listen to me and so What struck my mind is its very interesting that you have three English people sat here on the stage in What is quite possibly the least English place? We in England we have Blackpool we have Skegness and you have Atlantic City in Las Vegas And theres an impression that Americans have of the British and the people you think of tends to be it tends to be Churchill and the royal family and then the the cast of Downton Abbey and Benny Hill and are you being served in that? So a Monty Python and thats Britain to you? But Britain etre and Britain and England, they these are countries with a deep history both of science and in the arts Its its the country of Sir Isaac Newton of Charles Darwin of a Faraday and on the outside Its the country of Shakespeare of the Bronte sisters more money of Stanley Kubrick of the rolling stones of JK Rowling And what weve got here are two of them bought most  most people from our country in those two fields in the field of science and in the field of the Arts on the one hand we have Richard Dawkins, who as you know, the premier evolutionary biologist of his time a science educator Second to none the mer Oxd University professor  the public understanding of science  author of such books that have changed lives as  Selfish Gene the blind watchmaker and  God Delusion And then we have Stephen Fry who described earlier and I have never heard a person who fits this better of the Renaissance man  actor on film on TV on stage the author the playwright the radio  quiz show host and if you have not watched Qi Start watching TOI  director of Norwich City Football Club But more than that this is a man who has educated us a man whos educated us in humanism and in humanity whos educated us in history in LGBT rights and those issues in mental health concerns and In the eftless superiority that comes with being English This is wonderful and and I am privileged My mother has said she will never speak to me again because I am sat here between these two gentlemen So Im gonna pass this over to dr. Dawkins now that phrase eftless superiority ually, you never it really comes from it comes from Bailey or College Oxd Oh  eftless superiority that marks the Bailey. Oh man well Steven is not a Bailey. Oh, man. I happen to be But um, I did worry a little bit about the same thing Nick was talking about shes got to be a terribly English party and I worry but about that Not only are we both  Oxbridge, but all three of us, I think but Steven and I both went to very similar schools as well. In fact neighbouring schools I was wrongfully word up in these our rival schools and I looked up upping among the web and its exactly like our depressingly so And you talk about it in your autobiography and brought back horrible memories. Not that I was there, but very similar Memories, but I also got the feeling that you you back on it even though you were expelled You look back on it with a certain nostalgia I do I do and I picked up on a few things that Nick said and you mentioned also about Englishness and yes I am considered by many to be quintessentially English phrase thats often used and and I find it interesting Too of the 20th centurys figures of whom you would most use that phrase are probably Winston Churchill and I Christie Who was absolutely typify everything it is to be English and in both cases like me y had eign parents. y were only half English Churchill was half American as you probably know his mother was an American woman Agatha Christies father was an American My parent parents my fathers very English, but my mothers family was little European Jewish and I think sometimes not belonging to a culture especially one is established and as Naturally replete with its iconography of oak trees and Robin Hood Shakespeare and cricket and castles and royalty and so on but having a family who had embarrassingly eign and swooped in from Israel and New York bearing presents and doing that thing that no Englishman could possibly abide which is talking about food and  bunch of eat we should eat what you dirty? I dont talk about eating. Its like talking about going to the lavatory You cant possibly do it so I was filled with the embarrassment of the part of me that wanted to be totally English and say, you know pretend my eign family didnt exist and a Great self-consciousness about what it was to be Asian To move that on to our subject that begins I was sent away to boarding school when I was seven So it was like 200 miles from home which in English terms is the entire length of the country So my parents seemed to send me away very early to go and stay there and the day was marked out by religious services as they are in these schools and then it was in the public school after that again, and and I became immensely interested and immensely moved by the  the architecture the liturgy and everything to do with Religion and I wanted to be a priest an Anglican priest but high Anglican I liked it. I liked the  I liked the smells I liked Ritual I liked the feeling of belonging. I loved everything about it and it got to the stage where I ually went to see the suffrage and Bishop of Lynne in Norfolk I didnt quite know what to suffer Gunn Bishop is its one of those words. Its only ever applied to Bishop you never meet a suffrage and teacher or a brain surgeon something but anyway It was a suffragan digit bishop and he chatted to me and when we talked about theology and so on and then and then he asked a question about God and I said, oh, well, thats Thats my one problem He said go on I said, you know, I am I never been spoken to by God or spoken to God or have any real sense that there could be such a thing that Because the beauty of the church is its made by man  anchored Church in particular was constructed in a very short time by Archbishop Cranmer and 10 to the 8th to some extent And I liked it. I liked what it stood  I liked its breath and its sort of tolerance as a church but the idea of there being a God just struck me as being preposterous and and in my excitement of Fondness  the a merkin Church I had gotten that really believing in God was still a small in the case of Anglican but necessary part And he advised me to come back when God had spoken to me, and Im still waiting  But but I Im really I dont know how you feel about Richard I know youre sometimes accused not knowing enough about religion which is nonsense because I know you do know a lot about the history of Christianity and other religions and and Sometimes people who said to me but you love box masses the you know You love his the b-minor mass You love the you you know that its in Matthew and this is John you you you love so much. We cant artists you love Mozarts requiem you know, whatever you love Michelangelo and you love yes Who doesnt but there are number of things you can say about that one is obviously the church was the great employer and the time of the Renaissance and So they had artists had no one else to paint  but the other thing he said that the fact that Religious art can be beautiful doesnt make religion true. For example Without slavery, we would never have had what was called the Negro spiritual or gospel  But I thing that means you have to believe in slavery. Its its just that sometimes, you know, there are certain ways of Mankind organizing themselves that can that artists will produce great art from and and it is one of those peculiar ideas, I mean after all most of Renaissance art after some 120s was more likely to be based on Greek mythology and You dont ask whether or not You know whatto and and another office like that believed in Apollo Yes, yes Talking about of Greek mythology, of course, youll let your latest book I think is on on is Miss awesome and Just register greatly enjoyed it Do you take you dont take more lessons from that? Do you know its very unlikely top staples is there not Aesops fables? I absolutely agree. I mean, theres no question. You can look at quite a lot of Greek myth and say that it has tropes what are known in the business is myth Eames, which will be a familiar first m of words to you and Which repeat both within Greek mythology and indeed in other mythologies, but particularly in Greek mythology again And again, you have like the Phaeton myth You know, who was the son of Apollo stroke Helios the Sun God who who demanded of his father it would be an absent father And felt guilty. He demanded that he be allowed to ride the charity of the son And having granted him. Anyway, he couldnt back off and Phaeton gets on the chariot And of course he goes to to near the Sun and the the earth freezes at the poles He plunges too deep and the the deserts get med as he burns the earth and eventually Zeus sees that hes destroying the planet by moving the Sun up and done and and he Thunderbolt him out of existence and and You probably know the story of Icarus, too of course the son of dangerous the inventor who made the wings In the he told his son Icarus that he mustnt go too near the sea or you know the wingtips will be caught in and be made sodden and waterlogged and hed be drowned or he mustnt fly too close to this because Because the the feathers were held on with wax which would melt and he would plummet and of course he plummeted And there are there are lots of Greek myths along those lines, which if you exhibit what you might call hubris a people overstretching indeed that the Greek  stretching too far is detainees and the Titans were the race of the sort of second race of Divine beings the Titans stretched too far and and the Greeks I think were aware that they were the first civilization through all kinds of accidents including the arrival of the alphabet and and you know Richly linear B. And then the Greek alphabet they were the first nation to believe in progress to believe that as it were a father should outdo a son a child should outdo a parent and And thats why I think Greek myths full of things like Phaeton And the the young trying to fly too close to the Sun because the Greeks had as an example Egypt you they looked across the Mediterranean and  three and a half thousand years the Egyptians hadnt invented anything new three and a half thousand years and Extremely prosperous civilization had basically stayed the same as had other Civilizations as far as we know around the world. y had established themselves. This is how we build a pylon This is how we do a lintel and entablature. This is how we worship. This is how we move food about thats it Mm-hmm. We now have a viable life and it could last  four thousand years but the Greeks with incredible speed changed everything change the way they ran their politics into deems or or city-states Changed the way they used voting and and change the way they had juries and a justice system mathematics and algebra and logic even Pythagorean rules about  and harmony all these things appeared at incredible speed and the arrival of a literature and and and It was best but by Browning I think Summing up. This Greek is stretching out. This constant feeling that there is more you can discover more its all there to be discovered and Ignores, this is word  that they discover from within their own experience as human beings and through experiment with the world and Browning as browning put it that a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven ? And I think Plato and the Greeks understood the idea of heaven, although they talked about God in heaven y knew them exactly as a model as an idea re is an ideal to which we strive and the Greeks are constantly striving towards something better. y dont believe you know that as Simon Raven the novelist put it the genius of the Greeks lay in this understanding of eschatology of you know, the idea of a life after death and It was put by sinon I think the Greek who said any single person who tells you that they know what happens to a human being After they have died is either a liar or a fool simple an obvious thing to say, but the Greeks had that and its mysterious to us because We tribally and  hundreds of years almost thousand and a half years Struggled to have such a simple honest open idea anybody who tells you what happens after you die. Its hotter or alive read Stephen Ive read you saying somewhere that we must believe there is no life after death Oh, yes And and because we we really live a very bad life unless we do believe It because if we think we this is this is just a preparation. Yes. Yeah I remember being shocked bee he shocked us  other reasons by Mel Gibson Well, I know But he was being interviewed this is in the 80s at the very height of his young stardom when he was the coolest man on the planet virtually and I had no idea that he was belonged to this particularly severe Catholic section in Australia that his father was there was a member of But with the interview said, I believe Ive read somewhere Mel that youre You you believe in life after death and in and Mel Gibson said well I know I know one thing  a fact res got to be more to it than this What What even if you were just an ordinary guy? To say oh, yeah, this is America Australia this Europe. res the Lake District. res the poles theres the deserts res the tropics. res the bushes this if the galaxy there are units but theres gotta be more than that surely but not only that you are a star who can have as much sex as you can eat and and as much money as you could possibly demand and you feel its somehow not enough, you know, and this idea that Of course were all kinds of obvious ways of knowing that religion, you know uses Uses the afterlife and the threat of something better as a way of allowing people Forcing people to put up with what theyve got But yes, I do believe that even on its own terms if you believe in an afterlife its limits this life You know youve got to as Oscar Wilde said try the fruit of every tree of every orchard in the world and some will be bitter and some will be a too addictive and And so on but but if you and and so I often say to religious people I said, you know It would say well suppose, you know a Calvinist Appears of the gates of heaven and some Peter says so what did you make of them? Cannabis sativa, the the plant there. Oh, I never tried that. No, no  idea how much eft went into making this very special plant Im not saying you should have nothing, but but you didnt even try it What about wine or no, no no wine touch my lips you fucker do you know Do you know how complex the grape is unique of all fruits? You dont have to add sugar For it to turn into this remarkable and you didnt even bother to try it thats such an extraordinary idea I mean now, you know Pete you should on your deathbed you should be going damn it I I never drank milk from the armpits of a Nepalese virgin or whatever it is I never I dont know that wouldnt be my particular one that some people You know, I never climbed Kilimanjaro. I never you know, theres so much. Thats so beautiful I Once asked the professor of ancient history at Oxd whether the Greeks really believed in their gods and to my surprise, he said yes Definitely did its very interesting. I mean theres  the gods are so colored. I mean the twelve Olympian gods and there were many others I think they used the names of primal gods that had no personality and they did believe in them as abstract words Aristotle uses them a lot the Greek words  necessity cause and blame  example necessity Ananka is very strong idea in Greek philosophy and Morris Doom  ones do and literally means its not a word you use in English, but it used to be used portion What is allotted to you? Yeah And they were the first we know of again because of their first to have writing But to go and very sophisticated ways into the question of free will Which is a very hot issue at the moment as you probably know very few philosophers now all scientists believe there is such a thing as free well and they kind of dont speak about it because its been embarrassing because if you have to explain to people that that doesnt mean that theres no such thing as Responsibility and it doesnt mean that we dont try and live a good virtuous life According to our lights and so on but that its a sort of intellectual point about being fairly clear re is no such thing as free well or as shop and how poor did we we we can well what we do But we cant will what we will theres a very important point and the Greeks were very interested in that and so they they had this idea of fate and necessity Europe your portion which they gave a kind of divine permanence that these were things that were there that were Outside our control and I think most of human history And most of myth and religion is a has been a question of refining Our understanding of things we cant control so when our ancestors were really were alone and without any Building or farming yet as being an idea We were hunter-gatherers as the Frazees ir children looked at the mothers and fathers and they said why does what is it that pushes leaves out of trees? Its something thats beyond our control. I know if I pick a stone up  stone is picked up, but how it what is the power behind the leaf coming out of a tree happens every year? What is this fire that comes out of a mountain? What is the water that drops out of the sky? se are things over which we have no control. And so its very natural that our ancestors gave them personality Its the first thing we do its its its as much art and literature as it is religion to to to make a story out of these ces And so you you you name a god of the mountain that roars fire? You name a god of the clouds? And the Thunder and you have a God of nature and of growth and the harvest and and one of decay and you make rituals Out of it and well, then slowly you begin to understand them and each one that you understand the God disappears But this is what enemies do and them and I I get that but To believe that Zeus turned himself into an eagle in order to oh, I dont I I dont think Aristotle Plato believed Oh, Im sure they didnt but did the ordinary Athenian in the street believe that and I suspect not but I dont think they did. I think they they Conveniently said much as we you know much as childrens fairy stories do that. re was a time when men and women walked with pixies and fairies we say, you know and there was a time when men and women consorted with gods the Greek said when the gods would cut gods would come down in the m of an eagle or Whatever or they would turn human beings into flowers And a lot of these etiological myths there misdescribed to describe the causes of things and and and some of them are some of them have profound insight and some of them are just sweet stories like  example when Zeus and Hera got married Zeus had said that any any any One who or anything any creature that could come up with the best food  the  the wedding? Would be granted a wish and so you imagined this kind of Gordon Ramsay situation on these You know TV chef things were all these trestle tables and all these double, you know a young Haran had created a little sort of jelly  them to eat and they try that and then all the other animals and they come to this tiny little pot and Hiro Tasted this is delicious and Zeus tasted. So this is very good What is it in the little creature called Melissa who has made it says there if you please Ive made this Its a very special process Ive invented I go from flower to flower and I collect all the little bits of nectar, and I then put them together But it takes a huge amount of eft. But anyway, Ive made this pot of it I call it honey and Zeus in here and say well youve won the prize. res no question named your wish and Melissa says well, it takes so much eft and Days and days and days to make the smallest amount of my honey And and one swipe of a Foxys Pour and one lick of a bears tongue and all my work can be undone And youve given the scorpion a weapon and the snake of venomous bite, but I dont have any weapon So, can you give me a fatal sting so that anyone who tries to? steal steal my honey its fatal and Zeus is furious and theres a bit sound of thunder because he thinks its such a selfish Wish this is very well says you will have a fatal sting. She squeaks in triumph fizzes, but but it will be fatal to you and as you know a wasp can sting as many times as it likes them but but a But a bee sting is barbed a honey bee sting which is melissa is honey Bee, of course And and and so they have to pull her and guts out after theyve stung you and they kill themselves and that was uses punishment  her selfishness But pleasingly as Richard will know the the order of 2 which bees and wasps belong is known as Hymenoptera - - entomologists which means wedding wings Anyway, so thats just a sweet story. Thats the typical mythic story But then there are I think profound insights. So Im sure youve all heard of the muses the nine sisters who lived in And who represented each one of them one of the arts? Chapstick or a  dance and clear victory and so on and so th But whats so interesting is that their mother my father was used of course because he was properly bit with his seed but their mother was one of the original Titan s is one of the first twelve of the Titans whose name is Mnemosyne a Man named Watson. Hey, thats difficult word to say and it simply the Greek word  memory as in mnemonic and So there the Greeks are saying there what Joseph Campbell would he called myths? He called them public dreams Which I think is a rather brother, you know, you called them the collective unconscious but whatever it is Whether its the public dream of the Greek people or their collective unconscious y said the arts are all daughters of memory. And I think that is extremely true Its a compressed poetic idea that artists reassemble Put back together again learned experience felt emotions truthful recall of what it is to be alive and that theree all artists are summoning that memory muses are the daughters of memory and thats an accident if you like of the beauty of human culture that a people can come up with a myth a way of Personifying I complex ideas abstract ideas, but let me ask about this Ive always been fascinated by where they come from. Its its as though we believe that somehow these things emerge from you coordinate or fight yearly and collective unconscious or but Somebody must actually have sat down and made it up in the first place. Just emerge You have a jokes, isnt it? Where did the joke? Told that joke and the campfire or something some read means one assumes around a fire. Yes. I have a I Im because of one of my greatest is language as well. I think its very I think its you know, its Clear that around a fire You know, its cold there are animals wolves are howling and the children that cant get sleep and Full tummies and you want to tell stories and everythings mysterious and as I say you want to explain things the Greeks had this advantage that oh, No other myths up until that time and many after didnt have and that is as I say they had they had settled down as a people as the Doric people Iommi and people the various different people of the of the of the of the peninsula of Greece and so on and writing had arrived so Hesiod and Homer were able to put down and so you could have pedigrees and family histories and Chronologies of the gods which had never happened bee but who first came up with them and their names? Well, you can be You know, you can be sure that they all came from further east y follow the development of mankind and civilization as we currently understand it which as you know Really seem to spring up in what they call the Fertile Crescent the Greek  between rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates and the Greek  between rivers is Mesopotamia so its that area that what is now Iraq? huge irony being the very place where Isis has pulled down so many of those archaeological reminders of where Mankind first started to civilize itself in as much as we ever have I to settle and have roots and cities so on and and that thats where it began the first of those gods as far as we can tell they then moved west from tyre and the Lebanon  Cadmus myth which comes from the beginning of the alphabet comes from there was the Phoenicians It was Cadmus his brother, Phoenix Who had founded the Phoenician Empire and its I know I mean, you know You will never really know because so much that we need to know comes bee writing or even carving it But we can guess lets move to the modern world now youve said in defense of the royal family and Surprisingly youve Met said that youre a monarchist of a sword over and one of the points you made was that well, theres a queen has no power Officially, its somehow good  the Prime Minister. y have to go every week. Yeah, and as it were explained herself To the monitor and if only Trump had to go to Uncle Sam, yeah, thats right Exactly. I I did I wrote an op-ed  the New York Times Which I said exactly that a couple of fourth of July ago I said you know if there if Uncle Sam was a living person this embodiment of  US and it only occurred to me when I was writing the article that Uncle Sam his initials were u.s.a did so obvious So there with his bony knees and his wispy beard and his stripy top hat and in his waistcoat with the stripes and the stars and everything all over it and and He is an embodiment a personification of what America is supposed to be Barely a real human being at all more an idea and thats what a queen is Thats what a monarchy is not I mean, of course somewhere theres some real DNA real person who sits on a laboratory and all the rest of it but the Queen as far as were concerned is an image in imago a Sort of you know a Constant a constant embodiment of an idea not a not a person and thats why when people meet Queen Anne actually a great friends of this festival and of the great amazing Randi are Penn Jillette and Teller you know Penn & Teller who kind of earned this town as magicians and great skeptics and rationalists and I was Emceeing of this is literally 20 years ago now Because Im doing the same thing in three days time with  his 70th birthday But it was the 0th birthday of the Prince of Wales and I was M seeing the show we did at the London Palladium and Penn & Teller did some magic at it and After that curtain came down  Penn was next to me said oh no what happens now? Weve got to meet the princess up right? Thats it Yeah, he just comes along So later everybody and pen doctor said well, I gotta call me your majesty I said well no, hes not the monarch you technically it would be your royal highness if you wanted to come anything But dont bother just I havent called you pen once since weve been chatting in the last day and you dont call people by their Name do you Nick do you Richard? You know, its so just dont bother dont think about it good and do I have to bow because Im American we dont bow He knows youre American hes heard your voice you may not know that l is American so doesnt speak but he knows youre American Honestly, its fine. Well, Im gonna get put in the Tower of London Oh  heavens sake I assure you its fine Anyway, Prince was in love. Did you see? Oh, how do you do? Thank you  coming do appreciate it He gets to Penn who fools your royal majesty Highness  Prince looks a little baffled, but hes used to it. It happens all the time he moves along and again and then of course Penton Smith said I betrayed my country Why did how do what power do they have And it is that power that exists and its not the same as a pretend religious thing Its something we understand in minor ways we know what the power of a brand is in court in the corporate world and and in a much more concentrated an extraordinary an almost mystical way the power of a brand like a monarch is such that I have seen people who are furiously Anti-monarchist II who in the presence of the cream will melt slightly and if president Trump were not the head of state But were the servant of his people like a prime minister who? has a head of state who would be Uncle Sam and if light the Prime Minister has to every single week come what may Prime Minister has to go to back in Palace and have an audience with the Queen Youll probably remember if you ever saw the series the crown When the cream first ascended to the throne her first Prime Minister having to be Winston Churchill who had to come in to her presence And stand an old man, not that physically well Stand in her presence and explain himself to this young girl Who was the symbol of her country and she took the mantle on and shes been doing it ever since? Now if Trump had to do that had to go to some colonial mansion on the hill Where this this figure our Uncle Sam was well now well now young young young. Mr. Trump. What have you been doing this week? And And Trump had to bow his head and hes bowing He said not because he believes in monarchy or some trumped-up nonsense to do with the divinity of Kings But because he is the basing himself in front of the idea of the country He is there to serve. I think thats mentally helpful. And thats where I think myth ritual and ceremony Have real place as long as you know what they are because if you actually believed as a god or you know If you you know, as long as you understand that the most its the Wizard of Oz operating the levers but then nonetheless the power it has over us is it we are you know as evolutionary Biology and and and so which is is, you know a hugely growing field were beginning to understand a little more about how he evolved in terms of our feelings as well as our cognition and Im sure many of you have read some of the popular books that have been around in the last dozen years dealing with the subject of our that the contingency of our understanding of anything at exactly the time when the world is disintegrating and the Power of the UN or the EU or other groups, however, flawed to bring people together Everyones being propelled against and even today I noticed Trump has got rid of the 1986 or 87 is it? strategic arms Treaty with Russia. He just announced today. Hes hes Terminating it. He said so as all of this happens and as Less and less Authority and understanding of our in the world happens. We are beginning to understand how little we actually know so that while Skeptics and rationalists are very keen to remind people of how we should always examine the truth and look at the truth We are the first to understand thanks to Daniel Kahneman and thanks to various others how little we know and how how how much our cognition and how much our understanding is colored and changed is Transmogrified by both what we wish and what we have experienced what our body expects us to feel or our eyes expect us to see and and we cant necessarily trust in in in everything but Thats an excitement. That doesnt mean we give up trying to know things It means we try even harder to realize how you know, just how How our emotions have a huge part to play in everything we do we are immensely Emotional and being skeptical and being rational is not denying that its understanding it its understanding the the part emotions have to play and and ritual and ceremony and Metaphor and symbol which are the substance of art and so on Also the substance of a lot of ways humans behave. I mean, even you the comedy of me not knowing who was to take the  the award that I was given I I almost wanted to say well the one thing the church gets right is they rehearse?  bishop the bishop has told the old world we dont know what hes told the older boy But You know, theres a way you hold it here. You put it down here This goes here and and Im sure many humanists in the room have have come across this issue of where we find the poetry and the Romance the ritual the glamour That the church has over the over hundreds of years has managed to find in order to send people away from the world and yet to come to a really good humanists funeral or wedding and some of them I was asked by a friend a concert pianist to To be the humanist preacher as it were his wedding and I did my best and one can raid and ransack the larder of of poetry and  that exists without having to adduce a creator  someones wedding or someones funeral but But we should learn from the fact that the churchs obviously I was not present of that weddings deal But I absolutely know you did it a lot better than any Or suffered in Bishop. I Mean and I think they disagree with you about funerals, too Ive been to a number of humanist funerals and theyve work well have a no question about it  religious ones are not tailored to the individual they are a mula an algorithm Which is in the Book of Common Prayer and they just read out as though it was anybody  humanist ones are about the person whos died. Yes, the person whos died their favorite poetry that they read  You got eulogies Speaking about them. res so much more is drooling Im see writing and tailoring it and being personal rather than as you say being a being general but on the other hand this its a good mixture because If you are married in a traditional service and you get a really dramatic Vicar or bishop and they say after the bride and groom have kissed those whom God hath joined Let no man put asunder. Yes, you think wow, thats good. That is good there You know, you really ought similarly ashes to ashes dust to dust. Yes, I think Wow I am joining in with my community in that. Yeah, thats good. But there are a few good phrases that you have gotta admit y came out Good, but we can we can match them. Yeah Shakespeare or week we can do it, but its also its a bit cultural You know, I I just just suddenly remembered. I was doing a filming in northern Spain and they have this amazing tradition the Basque the the chakra where the the the men cook and And and they had these male cooking clubs and all the wives and families and friends come and and the men do this Feeling outside often or if its in winter inside and we were invited to this and it was astonishing to see And a great thing to be a part of and when it finished people got up and started singing Basque songs and there were about seven of us have English on from in the film David Suchet used to be played Poirot so successfully he was playing the Polian I was playing Wellington and there were a few of us and they turned to us and said to Sing now We thought were gonna sing were gonna sing we all live in a yellow submarine theyve been seeing these basque songs of the mountains that are 300 years old and I said I dont know any English songs apart from pop songs I mean there is sort of early one morning just as the Sun was rising. re are few and maybe thats the problem maybe the problem with being English and Empire and everything like that is that we have no culture of our own weve just stolen so many has the worlds worst national anthem Yeah, we do have pretty grog pretty grim one of those do we yeah youve said Stephen that  catastrophe of Trump and brexit is more less a triumph of the right as a failure of the left. Yes Do you recognize the phrase regressive left which I think was coined by Margit know else? Yes. Ive come across it. Yeah Yeah, you have a view on that I am That theres a part of me that just wants to be mischievous and say look, you know This Grand Canyon close to where we are. Now, this Grand Canyon is opened up in America and really across the World and certainly the developed world did the chattering world if you like And its getting wider every day and theree P on each side of the divide they have to shout louder and gesticulate more horribly to be heard by the other side and theyre not being heard by the other side and theyre just making noises and screaming and hating each other deeply and thinking the other vile and and destructive and inhuman and I like to think of myself and Right-thinking people as cowering in the ravine at the bottom Unsure what to do because on the one hand you have a nativist alt right? Bringing up all kinds of nasty and unacceptable and horrifying racist thoughts and divisions, but also you have a preposterous a liberal liberal left shouting out these jargon istic and nonsense from the universities if I have to hear about the patriarchy and cisgendered white privilege Again, I did it, you know My heart has always been with the left and that makes it all the more difficult  me to think that I just cannot And I want this is at the heart of I think all we talk about being English too dramatic Spurn JK Rowling and Isaac Newton everything the one thing they all have in common is empiricism. Its not about Knowing anything. Its not about having a point of view, which is your Strict view of things. Its about finding out experimenting and trying things out and seeing what works and I think the left has a terrible problem in rhetoric and expresses itself in a way that is Precisely, it seems designed to alienate even soft right people even ordinary Republicans who? are Maddened by what they see is the nonsense of political correctness Most left people are not you know, prey to it. But untunately that mouthpieces on either side are so loud And youre supposed to take a stand. Im supposed to be on one side or the other. Well, I I just Repudiate that I wouldnt be on either side. Neither means anything to me and and so we have to run I Was thinking a lot about my friend Christopher Hitchens whose spirit is occasions like this, of course It was much stronger than I was and his great hero As a political writer and thinker was George Orwell who was much stronger and more ceful about these things than as Christopher was more strong and more ceful about these things than I am. My hero really was probably em Stowes better known as a novelist but as an essayist, he had a lot to say and His attitude its probably best summed up by one of his essays which is called two cheers  democracy he was I cant quite bring myself to Sound three. Cheers He said but two cheers is about right and he and his friend Bertrand Russell and the mayor made the point about how we live in the world that Those who are stupider are so full of certainty and and those who are wise are so unsure a WB Yeats would put it most famously in the you know, the ceremony of innocence is drowned and  best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity. Well, not home  center will not hold exactly and thats the problem being in the center, which will not hold the best Which you hope youre part of the best lack all conviction. Were not certain. Were not convinced Were not sure how the world should go ward But we see we recognize ugliness when we see it And graceless honest and unkindness and brute ce and and clamouring kind of binary tearing away of everything so that you know this constant youre either with us or against us attitude and and the stuck here in the middle People say well, you know Thats all very well. But thats you just being a liberal You know Squashy soft, you know, there are people dying out there yll say you know, and yes, there are and one does you know? Look at the row hinges being massacred in and Disrupted and destroyed in Burma and and and look at you know Look at whats going on in them or all over the Yemen and Syria and places like that res all kinds of terrible things happening But I dont I dont hear the the regressive left or the liberal liberals as I gone all the right making any fuss about that and and I Im Desperate to know what to think I really am unsure because part of me says yes, of course all my life I fought  gay rights I fought  you know, I thought  to listen To sighs even fought at all. Ive sat at a desk and tapped into keyboard Done the odd interview on the subject of gay rights, so I havent fought at all But I have at least expressed an opinion and and and you know My heart is with you know with with people being given a fair shake of the source bottle as australians put it You know and a fair shake is it seems to be good? But we now Arent allowed really much room  conversations of any nuance or any any doubt you have to be on one side or the other and and the world Im convinced of it America certainly Britain and Europe are crying out  something in between and untunately what weve had in between in the past and its too recent to be Forgotten in America is Bill Clinton. And in Britain was Tony Blair Both of them very impressive people in terms of their grasp of history And the mechanics and process of power and all the rest of it, but who are slightly kind of I? know disreputable in our eyes in case Britain in the case of Blair because he took us into an Iraq war which most of us think is a mistake  case of Clinton all kinds of reasons have to do with his own behavior as well And so that third way that they represented a very self-conscious Third Way is its treated with suspicion My feeling is that a true satirist and some of a true insider Jonathan Swift would actually be saying to you all and I should be saying to myself Dont look to blame politicians dont look to blame the the slogan ears on either side of the culture wars. Its not their fault Its your fault We are the ones who say oh Look at politicians. yre always just disagreeing with each other and then the moment theres a third way politician You say well, theyre all the same Well mark, you can have it both ways. Do you want them all the same or do you want them all different? Its actually you are the problem you and I are the problem We want to drive around in cars and we want a green clean world where you cant have both You cant square that circle there are lots and lots of circles that cant be squared in squares that cant be circled but we lay off all our guilt or our own self discussed at our greed and our rapacity as Creatures on this earth we lay off that burden on Politicians who we pay to take our disgusting filth. That should be ended us And bee we finish up and move over to the book signing there was one question I wanted just would address to both of you on this and and yesterday untunately You were stuck somewhere on Delta When we heard Steven Pinker speak and very optimistic that we are, you know  world is getting wealthier poverty is going down Malnutrition is going down  the economy is moving ward yet on the other hand we see Not just the political catastrophes that are happening, but also the potential environmental disasters that the UN is talking of Unfolding are you both both short-term and long-term. Are you optimistic? Are you pessimistic? Where are we going as a world? well Steven Pinker and Matt Ridley both my friends are sort of the - optimists in the world at the moment And y make they both make a persuasive case that Science can do all sorts of things and we may be in trouble in all sorts of ways but science will will find a way And if you look at the broad sweep of history things are getting better. I desperately want to believe them I Would like to try to put the optimistic case say we we are in a temporary Reversal at the moment things are not going. Well at the moment. se are going extremely badly at the moment both in Britain and America But if you do take the long view of history III think its possible to be optimistic. So Unrealistic as it sounds Im gonna sort of slightly set aside with Pinker and Ridley. Yeah. Thats very good I agree with you Richard and I think you know a lot of Human progress has been three steps ward to back or two steps ward one back whatever, but it has been ward but this may be a step back moment where things are bad, but I think theres a lot to Think about I do some work occasionally  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation who are particularly strong on the SDGs as theyre called the sustainable Development goals now is one of these dull bureaucratic phrases that it began with the Millennial goals in the year 2000 where all the countries the United Nations signed up to certain aims and these were refined in the year 2010 Into these sustainable goals 27 of them a lot to do with the female education,  example And things that people know will transm the way that the the poorest and the most disease ridden in the world those with the fewest Opportunities in the world that can most be taken out of poverty and the results there have been a standing I mean truly amazing in that period 2002 now which many people think of as the post 9/11 period the period of fear of terrorism and and so on which of course it has been but in that period 66 66 percent greater increase in women having education around the world 66% 2/3. I mean thats pretty astonishing and the results against HIV and and even the You know More resistive strains of TB and other diseases these are being controlled in ways That would have seemed impossible 1 years ago. And so in that respect things are going very well but I would agree the threat to the to the climate into the world thats being offered is its a desperate while and also as I said that lunch today and all this is ignoring the technological transmations that are coming in the next 20 or 30 years with AI and biotech and by augmentation and Gene editing and stem cell work and I mean res so much of it each one of these technologies on its own would be transmative But together they represent what I call it tsunami that is approaching us and a lot of that will be helpful to health Extraordinarily helpful to health will create great economies of scale the data Which become the new currency rather than petrol or the dollar data is the currency will allow all kinds of medical advances Im convinced and I hope a more rational view of You know genetic modification of crops will allow  the immense promise they offer people are very superstitious about them as if theres a monstrous as if theyre new even so I think there are all kinds of scientific possibilities that will help but I We just have to be alert and its this is what you know, skepticism really means alertness being alive to an idea Thats seeing an idea as a living thing and and in honor of my rival University Oxd For which you both come and its a carriage man that as a great admirer of Oscar Wilde I will and just by quoting and I think this is what conventions like this do and should foster and When Oscar wrote his letter to to his old lover Posey from prison its called De Profundis from the depths and he accuses him of a lot of betrayals and things but hes also very Complimentary to him but he says when you were at Oxd you didnt get a degree Thats perfectly understandable. Many fine brains have never managed to get their degree But what I find inexcusable is that you never acquired what used to be called  Oxd manner said I know that sounds a terrible phrase But I take to mean this the ability to play gracefully with ideas Is that a wonderful thing the ability to play gracefully with ideas and I think its very important that the skeptical rationalist a secularist atheist movement remembers to be graceful Remembers that playing with these ideas is what enlightens us Individually and fulfills us as humans as well as fulfilling I hope much more of the of the public culture that you know  understanding that ideas are to be embraced and hugged and played with and licked Enjoyed and have the juice sucked out of them and you know that theres pleasure in this its not an earnest endeavor Its not a grim piece of work. Its its an excitement And I think thats that will that will ensure the better future being alert and playing gracefully with ideas Thanks  watching if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends Dont get to subscribe to the channel and ring that bell to be notified about new videos You can follow us on social media And if you really love what we do consider supporting us with a donation links to all that good stuff is in the description below"

high-stakes high-level countdown oh I see the bit that really drives you mad is a bit of choosing the letters and the numbers down so what about 8 out of 10 cats does countdown plays darts so introduced a darts element in to count them so the idea would be instead of playing a clever vowel or a consonant you just throw a dart and if it lands in one  example thats a and if it lands in 18 thats another letter Im sure somebody will know so on and then bee well we all know that  is d very good what happens if you get a bulls-eye a bulls-eye we dont have to play the game lot of people say

comedian to perm believe he was because he was your support sure was our support but he was in sketches so he actually didnt come on until about the middle of the show but people just think its true but let me just double check we shot Sean is that true you were the first yes I was first yeah I liked about the story is that theres some journalists you concocted it and they think it was fed back to me said you were the first and its quite a bit of publicity so I just went yeah I went along with it  years yeah and then it became the truth thats how history is written I did a best man speech at my brothers wedding and his wife was pregnant and I opened up with its lovely to see them together the brides legs that is promise you that the brides family left the restaurant very bad call yeah in the countryside there was a sheep giving birth in the field while the wedding was going on in the marquee and the best man end of the speech was like and a new life is born the sheeps giving birth

this is actually it cost me a lot of money on eBay and this is some of the Duchess of Cambridge or Kate Middleton as she then was some Ive heard toenail clippings there we go you see theres a little toenail clipping of very very royal person what do you mean genuine but I mean it it cost me twenty five thousand pounds its just not all can be ordinary ones can it thats thats definitely from her the great thing about these is as DNA technology advances what I have in here is her DNA code which means that in the years to come I will be able to make another one and then she will have no rights in law should just be my creature its just the clippings in the tap I was targeted by an inflated feely Acker who tricked me into putting like clear bags down my like different again and talked about

house colors isnt it that comes out its its little handkerchief  mopping his brow when hes had a tough day being an Abba dictionary corner Joe what have you got  us well Jimmy I get a lot of parking fines and I have realized if you ask  evidence then often you can get out of the fine now I was up north doing a show and I got to find so I emailed the council asking  the evidence I got an email from some woman called Steph they said mr. lacet I have passed your email on to the freedom of inmation team hopefully theyll be in touch with you soon now I didnt like that word hopefully so I retired Steph sadly hopefully doth butter no parsnips can I have an email address  the person you have contacted my lawyers would like to contact them directly you have been very helpful and hopefully you wont get caught up in the thcoming thcoming with sinister enough mr. nice Im not sure what you mean about butter past ICC didnt the FOI team who will advise now I got an email from someone called Colin they said mr. lacet your request is very broad so Ive assumed you only want inmation person into your recent parking vine attached is the evidence which we have which are photographs of your car clearly Park syntax right now the photographs they had are of my window which has taxi rank written on it by presumably a disgruntled taxi driver theres actually no evidence of a taxi rank in that photograph so I went back to Colin didnt I mr. Colin when you assume you make an ass out of you and me I see that your evidence is nothing more than a picture of the words taxi rank written on my car I would argue this evidence is insufficient I also put PS apologies  the delay and replying to your previous email Im currently on the Costa del Sol I provided evidence of this and then I just put this picture [] I said mister Lysa in order to reverse the find you will need to provide evidence that your vehicle was not in a taxi rank so I said all mr. Kollin evidence supplied I was actually parked on the moon as you can see clearly at over blind mr. Lasser Ive canceled the fine now John you used to live with with our John Richardson didnt you yeah I lived with John  a year and is there anything we can do to help when we first met John he was living in a bedsit crystal and may I just say it was the cleanest bedsit I  Avon and Somerset Social Services have ever seen then we moved in together a group of comedians into a shared house but John was not quite used to sharing yet so there was a negotiation about mass in which we would sort of go about our normal routine and John had these suddenly you know just lets just have an anecdote  an anecdote deal here you tell this story and then daddyll tell us daddy Im a child its now legally accurate get these little out of nowhere youd be doing something and a little northern passive-aggressive commentary would start just start C be in the kitchen and suddenly this voice would go oh right is that where we keep the Coco Pops now [] where did we use to keep the toenails John did we used to Ill give you a clue Jimmy Oh his toenails into the mugs John once in a fit of pique was very frustrated with himself and like a lot of us do wanted to take that out on a mug however what John brought to that was he was so worried about the mess it would make he wrapped it in a tea towel James yeah have you got a mascot I do have a mascot yeah I have this guy I we dont actually have a name poorly but in my M its not this was my great great great possibly great grandfathers because he used to be a market trader and he would take his stall to market every day and this is a replica of the horse thing I didnt bring a mascot because and the producer said we got to have one and she said why dont you take this up [] [] were gonna be fine buddy dont win this evening you know why yes horse dont say that I didnt know that Im just like nine years bad little pits are the best Christmas gift youve ever received dog got a dog  Christmas I know you thinking I dog is  life not just  Christmas James but I mean this dog was just  Christmas to be fair but in my defense it was 1 when we got it only giving it until New Years anyway and I was just there hanging out of it Ive took really good care of it probably the happiest month  that dogs life really looked after that dog and then I mean it just went in the garden with all the other dogs Ive had  Christmas my god whats the top of your Christmas list this year dog okay and with James of course its Suzie donts this Christmas thousands of people will be waking up on Christmas morning and finding Suzie dents new book amongst their presents so if youre watching charity shop owners you might want to clear a shelf Suzie are there any Christmas words that you particularly like food its gotta be your youll hole what say you will hole you hole is the furthest hole on your belt sometimes have to make it and its reserved just  Christmas I dig in the garden  the dog its a little great really one thing I hate at Christmas but just all of the year is when people engrave messages into jewelry like sentimental messages theres a website I found that has some really horrible examples this one maybe you want to give to your partner a little gesture of your love  one another you might want to write our love is timeless onto a 10 1999 the other thing that I found was a necklace  somebody whos died which has got until we meet again  that special someone I find these offensive if Im honest and so what I thought Id do is see how offensive I could get with an engraver and so I got in contact with a friend of mine who works in Birminghams jewelry quarter  some contacts of some engravers and this is one text exchange I had I wrote hello Im looking to get a message engraved on a bracelet can you help the reply was sure what is the text  the bracelet I just went straight in and I replied the police he agreed to it I said ha thats different should be fine lets see how far we can go said it will need to be quite small as it will be  a child no reply another one I did hello Paul will call him I want a bracelet engraved with a heartfelt message have you any availability thanks Joe he replied I could do the next couple of weeks what sort of bracelet slash message I replied I need a rose gold bracelet engraved with youre not my real dad sorry no can do I said do not do rock fobs I wont engrave that message so I just thought well lets see where I can go with Paul so I said how about I Love You Sandra he said yes obviously I can do that so Paul can you do it in the shape of a swastika we dont do team names on this show but if we did I think it would be Brokeback Mountain today people get that actually those two did a very good job of looking after the herd
9,0,actually as you could see Jimmy you are the main Russian though youre in one of your swanky suits but as you can see pulled your trousers down and you pushed your testicles out part of it and so inside Jimmy is Rachel as you can see Rachel is holding some toilet rolls under our arms and because she steals the toilet roll after show which shes pissed up inside rachel is Susie now as you all know Susies pervert we have a peeping tom thats why shes wearing some binoculars and shes holding a pegar camera the region shes holding a Polaroid camera is because she does this thing where shell kick your dressing-room door down try and take a picture of you when you change it I spoke as a child but theyre scared of her temper and then finally John a life-sized John yeah sort of self-explanatory as you see they need toilets or pajamas because he struggles to get adult clothes to fit does everyone okay open it recording Tom Ellen concert used to dress in Victorian clothing as a teenager to disguise the fact he was gay yeah Tom fell from office endlessness look at Tom tell me about your love life hows it all going thats very personal question actually Jimmy fact recently Ive been dumped but its fine its fine it was a mutual decision  him to dump me no we both sort of realized it wasnt working untunately we realized at different times he realized some weeks bee I realized told me but its five five you know other good things we have Ive got one of these things now which tells me how my hearts doing yes still broken top of the show its fired up happy okay I will come of course it stood against speed is written 1 books about the derivation that was and you can find them all in your local library just ask  the sleepy go bye-bye section okay Susie what have you been looking into recently other than glory hole okay now what have you been looking into recently I think this is all the effect that we are all
12,0,so add Snowden a lot of people in this country are probably curious when was the last time you had substantive discussions about coming home to the United States and would this still be your preference do you still refer to it as home the United States will always be my home and Ill always be willing to come back on a single condition and Ive been quite clear about this over the years this is that the government guarantee that I have the right and every whistleblower has the right to tell the jury why they did what they did right we can disagree about whether this was right or wrong we can disagree about whether this is good or bad we can disagree about whether this is legal early illegal thats right and proper in a democracy but we have to agree that the jury is supposed to be the proper authority to ultimately decide was this right or wrong and I hate to say it but under current laws that is explicitly bidden under the Espionage  which as you know its increasingly being used against the sources of journalism instead of eign spies the law makes no distinction between someone who tells a secret to a journalist and someone who tells a secret to a eign government and and so yeah there have nots there has not been any movement untunately on that conversation since the  administration when I told that the government that all they need to do is give me the right of what we call a public interest offense this is a fair trial an open trial where the jury hears what is happening and they decide was this justified or not and untunately a then Attorney General Eric Holder responded and said we cant promise that we wont promise that we will promise not to torture you untunately Id say thats not quite enough something youve said repeatedly is that you would expect and you would accept a certain punishment  your actions what if that package of punishment in working  the home team what if someone said help us harden our elections from attack using your skills I would volunteer  that instantly you know they they wouldnt even have to pay me  that remember I volunteered to work  the CIA  the NSA when I came ward to reveal mass surveillance which we need to be clear the courts have found was in fact unlawful on the part of the government and one court said likely unconstitutional so I have no objection to helping the government I came ward not to burn the NSA down I came ward to rem it to help it return to the ideals that were all supposed to share so there will never be a question of when my government is ready when my government wants me to help I will be there how has your opinion changed about mr. Putin since youve been in Russia well I dont think it really has changed because the question might presume that I had a positive opinion at some point I think everyone would agree probably including the Russian President himself that he is an authoritarian leader I think the Russian government broadly does not have a good record on human rights and that hasnt changed how odd is it to you that while youve been there consensus here has hardened that they are the actors who interfered in our last presidential election I dont think thats especially surprising there was a story published in  New York Times actually reporting on a study in February of 2018 and was also done in the Washington Post a few months prior to that about the record of electoral interference and they looked at the history of Russia and the Soviet Union and an electoral Intel interference by intelligence agencies and they found I think 36 different cases of electoral interference over roughly the past 0 years but then they also looked at the United States intelligence services and found that we hit enter feared in eign elections eighty-one different times now this is not to say one is better than the other its not about that its about budget about capability but we do what we do see from this is that what happened in 2016 actually was not unusual from the perspective of intelligence agencies this is what they believe are they are hired to do what we have to do is find out how to secure our systems against the attacks that we know are inevitable something youve been asked bee something you have answered bee but since this is a fresh occasion well will ask it again why not stay in this country and face the  if you believed in the strength of your conviction this is a great question Brian and Im glad you asked it when we say face the  the question is well what song are they playing I was intentionally charged as every major whistleblower in the last decades has been with the very particular crime this is a violation of the Espionage  of 1917 and and this is a law that is explicitly designed to prohibit a meaningful defense in court this is applied or this law is used against people whos the only thing that theyve done and this is by the governments own terms the only thing the government accuses people defending themselves against this charge I have done is that they have told something to a journalist that the government considers classified that is the whole of the crime they dont consider whether it was good or bad they dont consider whether or not it caused harm simply did you tell something classified to a journalist if you did the jury is not allowed to consider and in fact theyre explicitly bidden from considering why you told journalists theyre explicitly bidden from considering did it result in a public benefit right did it further the public interest instead they simply say did you tell a journalist let the glass buy so I am NOT if I had stayed in the United States and my good friend Daniel Ellsberg by the way that has told me that I was right not to stand and wait  an inevitable arrest because the laws and the way theyre enced today is not the same as the 1970s when he came ward with the Pentagon Papers I would not have received a fair trial there would not have been much of a trial at all I would only have received a sentencing and the question there is what message does that send whether you like me or not I could be the best person in the world I could be the worst what message does a conviction where you spend the rest of your life in prison  telling journalists things that change the laws of the United States that have resulted in the most substantive rem so intelligence authorities since the 1970s if the only result of doing that is a life sentence in prison the next person who sees something criminal happening in the United States government will be discouraged from coming ward and I cant be a part of that where do your parents come down on what you did in the book we learn a lot more than we knew about them they were both we say this in quotes deep Staters we learn that they both had varying degrees of security clearances in their lives yeah I come from a federal family my father worked  the military my mother works  the courts my whole line going back has worked in the in the government service so I think this was difficult  them and in fact one of the things that I will be eternally grateful  is the fact that they still stand by me today and believe that I did the right thing were they present  your wedding youve gone and gotten married in the years since weve last spoken there hasnt been a wedding yet actually we were married but it was just a paperwork sighs in a courthouse because Lindsay and I had been living together we had been in love with each other we had been in a relationship  more than ten years there will be a wedding someday Brian and I hope youll be there what do you make of Donald Trump there are so many things that are said about the president right now and so much thinking and honestly I try not to think about it theres so much chaos and there are so many aggressive and offensive things said I think even his supporters would would grant that but I think hes actually quite simple to understand Donald Trump strikes me like nothing so much as a man who has never really known a love that he hasnt had to pay  and so everything that he does is inmed by a kind of transactional ism I think and what he is actually looking  is simply  people to like him untunately that produces a lot of negative effects do you believe he is a threat to national security I mean this is the question of who defines national security what is national security when we used to talk about national security we thought about public safety but now national security really means the security of the system itself the institution of government and I think hes made it his stated goal to change the way that system works I think we have seen tremendous harm done to civil liberties in the United States increasingly since September 11th and I havent seen any reduction in the rate of that we have several important jobs vacant in this country including director of national security national security advisor is that a threat to our security I think it really says something about where we are what this point in our history looks like when we find that there are not enough people in the country that are willing not to serve in the   and qualify to serve in the   who all sides of the government feel comtable working with and who they can back we are in a time that is increasingly fractured and I think thats a product of the fact that look if you look around at the world right now when you look at news when you look at news coverage when you look at every controversy that we see something has changed and that is that it has become increasingly popular  your feelings to matter more than the facts and I think thats toxic to a democracy because if theres one thing that we have to have to be able to have this discussion to be able to learn to live with people that we disagree with we cant have a conversation about what we should do we cant have a conversation about where we are going if we cant agree on where we are if we cant agree on what is happening facts have to matter more than the feelings youve said your greatest fear over what you did was that things would not change have things changed would you do it again today knowing what you know now this is a significant portion of the the final chapter of my book things have changed and I would do it again if I changed anything I would hope that I could have come ward sooner it took me so long just to understand what was happening and it took so long not to realize that nobody else was going to fix this believe me when I say I did not want to light a match and burn my life to the ground no one does nobody really wants to be a whistleblower but the results of that have been staggering I thought this was gonna be two days story I thought everybody was gonna get about this a week after the journalist ran the first stories in 2013 but here we are in 2019 and were still talking about it in fact data security surveillance the internet manipulation and influence thats provided or produced rather by a corporate or governmental control of this permanent record of all of our private lives thats been created every day by the devices that we have bee 2013 if you said theres a system thats watching everything you do the government is collecting records of every phone call in the United States even  those people who are not suspected of any crime it was a conspiracy yes there were some people who believed it was happening yes there were academics who could say this was technically possible yes there were technologists who could went this is something that could be done but what we didnt have it was we the world of 2013 we suspected some suspected that this was happening the world after 2013 we know that its happening and this is the critical importance of journalism particularly in this moment that we have today the distance between speculation and fact is everything in a democracy because thats what what lets us as we did post 2013 change our laws now the very first program that was real to newspapers I has since been terminated Barack  who criticized me so strongly in June of 2013 by January of 201 was proposing that this program be ended eventually it was ended under the USA Freedom  the NSA argued that mass surveillance was legal bulk collection as they they call it they said 1 different judges authorized this what they didnt tell us was that those 1 judges all belonged to the rubber-stamp FISA Court that over 33 years had been asked 33 thousand nine hundred times by the government to approve surveillance requests only said tow in 33 years 11 times now this was a court that was never designed to interpret the Constitution right it was never designed to create novel powers  the intelligence community it was just designed to stamp basic routine warrants now we know what has changed the very first open court outside of these secret rubber-stamp courts that got this case in front of them I was judge Leon in a federal court and then a court of appeals and said that the NSAs mass surveillance activities were violating even the very loose standards of the   they broke the law he further said these programs are likely unconstitutional and this would not have happened if we couldnt say this is real this is actually happening and I just want to make clear thats not me saying that thats not speculation that was the determination of the Supreme Court just a few months bee I came ward in a famous case Amnesty versus clapper I I believe it was in February of 2013 or door December of 2012 all the way to the Supreme Court these surveillance authorities were being challenged the plaintiff said the government has a mass surveillance program it has impacted this human rights organization they have been spied on in secret by the government the government said that may be but if its happening we will neither conm confirm nor deny that its happening it is a state secret and because you cant prove it the court should be bidden from ruling on the constitutionality of this program and sadly the Supreme Court of the United States agreed they said this program could be unconstitutional but if you cannot prove it exists we cannot evaluate it thats what 2013 changed on the legal side we have now had the GDP or we have firt had the first European regulation that are trying to limit the amount of data that can be collected secretly and used against populations broadly and we have also seen the basic structure of the Internet itself change in response to this understanding that the network path that all of our communications cross when you request a website when you send a text message when you read an email  so long those communications have been electronically naked or unencrypted bee 2013 more than half the worlds internet communications were unencrypted now far more than half are measured by just web traffic from where the worlds leading browsers the Google Chrome browser some figures showed it more than 80 percent the entire world has changed in the last few years it hasnt gone far enough the problems still exist and in some ways theyve gotten worse but we have made progress that would not have been possible if we didnt know what was going on related question what today can the government do to your phone and your laptop the phone and laptop of any American whats the extent of the governments reach if theyre determined to reach into your life we could talk about this question  hours Brian but we dont have time so Ill try to summarize hacking has increasingly become what governments consider a legitimate investigative tool they use the same methods and techniques as criminal hackers and what this means is they will try to remotely take over your device once they do this by detecting a vulnerability and in the software that your device runs such as Apples iOS or Microsoft Windows they can craft a special kind of attack code called an exploit they then launch this exploit at the vulnerability on your device which allows them to take total control of that device anything you can do on that device the attacker in this case the government can do they can read your email they can collect every document they can look at your contact book they can turn the location services on they can see anything that is on that phone instantly and send it back home to the mothership they can do the same with laptops the other prong that we get so frequently is that in many cases they dont need to hack our devices they can simply ask Google  a copy of our email box because Google saves a copy of that everything that youve ever typed into that search box Google has a copy of every private message that youve sent on Facebook every link that youve clicked everything that youve liked they keep a permanent record of and all of these things available not just to these companies but to our governments as they are increasingly deputized as sort of miniature arms of government what about enabling your microphone camera if you can do it they can do it it is trivial to remotely turn on your microphone or to activate your camera so long as you have systems-level access if you had hacked someones device remotely anything they can do you can do they can look up your nose right they can record whats in the room the screen may be off as its sitting on your desk but the device is talking all of the time the question we have to ask is who is it talking to even if your phone is not act right now you look at it its just sitting there on the charger it is talking tens or hundreds or thousands of times a minute to any number of different companies who have apps installed on your phone it looks like its off it looks like its just sitting there but it is constantly chattering and untunately like pollution we have not created the tools that are necessary  ordinary people to be able to see this activity and it is the invisibility of it that makes it so popular in common and attractive  these companies because if you do not realize theyre collecting this data from you this very private and personal data theres no way youre going to object to it what about its ability to track its own and talk to me specifically about the case of Jamal khashoggi so in the case of Jamal Khashoggi this is a Washington Post reporter and a primary critic of the Saudi regime he was lured into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in Turkey and while his fiance waited outside  him to get the paperwork he needed in order to marry her he was murdered by the Saudi government allegedly on the orders of the Crown Prince now we have to ask ourselves how did the Saudi government decide that he was worth killing how did they decide when and how they would kill him how did they know this opportunity was going to arise how do they know what his plans and intentions were that they needed to stop from their perspective we dont have evidence that his phone personally was hacked untunately because we do not have his phone but we do have the phones of his friends who were living in exile in Canada and we do know thanks to the research of a group called the citizen lab affiliated with a university in Canada that their phones were hacked which means their conversations with Jamal khashoggi were intercepted and this allowed the Saudi regime to know that he was intending to create an electronic protest movement they didnt need to know from his friends phone or even from his phone that he was travelling to the consulate because he had to make an appointment but it did tell them his private intentions his hopes and dreams  a different government  their country and perhaps although we do not know  sure on that basis they decided to murder him once your phone is hacked what is in their hands is not simply your device it is your future its important also to remember how did the government of Saudi Arabia manage to hack these peoples phones which are modern phones well they didnt have this capability in their government they didnt have this level of intelligence capability available to them directly so they purchased it from a digital arms broker a company called the NSO Group an Israeli company in this company the only thing they do is manufacture digital weapons kind of hacking tools they can be used against the critical infrastructure that all of us rely on the phones and our pockets they primarily target devices such as the Apple iPhone and they sell this capability to break into phones of people around the world  millions and millions of dollars to some of the worst governments on earth and the only meaningful oversight that they have untunately because the export control laws  these kind of digital weapons are extremely weak in Israel is their own internal ethics board this is oh it was fine we didnt break any rules that has to change what about the public attitude held by millions of everyday Americans all Ive got on a computer is pictures of my family CCTV cameras that are prevalent in a ton of American cities and overseas capitals those cameras are your friend if youre innocent and have nothing to hide well Id say thats very much what the average Chinese citizen believed or perhaps even still to this day believes but we see how these same technologies are being applied to create what they call the social credit system if any of these family photos if any of your activities online if your purchases if your associations if your friends or in any way different from what the government or the powers-that-be of the moment would like them to be youre no longer able to purchase train tickets youre no longer a to board an airplane you may not be able to get a passport you may not be eligible  a job you might not be able to work  the government all of these things are increasingly being created and programmed and decided by algorithms and those algorithms are fueled by precisely the innocent data that our devices are creating all of the time constantly invisibly quietly right now our devices are casting all of these records that we do not see being created that in aggregate seemed very innocent you were at Starbucks at this time you went to the hospital afterwards you spent a long time at the hospital after you left the hospital you made a phone call you made a phone call to your mother you talked to her until the middle of the night the hospital was an oncology clinic even if you cant see the content of these communications the activity records what the government calls metadata which they argue they do not need a warrant to collect tells the whole story and these activity records are being created and shared and collected and intercepted constantly by companies and governments and ultimately it means as they sell these as they trade these as they make their businesses on the backs of these records what they are selling is not inmation what theyre selling is us theyre selling our future theyre selling our past they are selling our history our identity and ultimately they are stealing our power and making our stories work  them what devices do you use in your life now and have you accepted the notion that you are watched rather constantly well probably every intelligence the world is definitely targeting me in trouble anything they can just as they did with Jamal khashoggi in regards to what are my plans and intentions I try not to make that easy  them if I get a smart phone and I need to use a phone I actually open it up bee I use it I perm a kind of surgery on it to physically desolder or sort of melt the metal connections that hold the microphone on the phone and I physically take this off I remove the camera  the phone and then I close it back up I seal it up and then if I need to make a phone call I will attach an external microphone on and this is just so if the phone is sitting there and Im not making a call it cannot hear me now this is extreme most people do not need this but  me its about being able to trust our technology my phone could still be hacked my laptop could still be hacked and just as I told you bee the same principles applied to me if it is hacked they can do anything to the device that I can do so my trust in technology is limited but just because thats how it is today doesnt mean thats how it has to be and a large majority of my work with the freedom of the press foundation where I serve as president of the board is dedicated to trying to make technology more secure to try to create programs and protocols by which we can make the communications of sources and journalists more confidential because if we lose the confidentiality between sources and journalists we lose access to those essential facts that let us understand whats happening in the world and untunately under this   just like under the prior   we see the sources of very important stories that have advanced the public interest facing retaliation from a very angry government I believe its in the first half of the book and Im paraphrasing you come out and just say the computer guy knows everything or at least he should what part computer guy are you were you and what part trained spy well  the vast majority of my career I was what was called a systems engineer or a systems administrator an administrator sort of maintains and expands a system that they have inherited and a systems engineer sort of develops new projects new capabilities  these systems roles what this means in short was that all of the systems the NSA and the CIA that I was put in charge of I had total access to and this is just what happens with the systems administrator when you think about a computer system who gives someone else access well someone has to be the original authority that has access to everything that was me and so I would say the computer guy knows everything thats not a boast thats simply the way these systems are designed thats the way theyre structured and this is very much a vulnerability because it means that you have to trust this this administrator will work to the good of the users but what happens when the people using that network the people constructing that network are going against the benefit of the broader society and this put me in a very interesting kind of conflicted position I could do what the NSA wanted me to do or I could do what the Constitution of the United States the the public of the United States needed me to do which was report that my agency had broken the law do you regard yourself as a journalist these days Im not Im not I have tremendous respect  journalists but I try to keep a distance particularly in this moment where so much of journalism is coming under attack because the government has a tremendous incentive to discredit me to make people distrust me and so if I hold myself out if I start reporting stories if I start talking to sources if I try to start advancing what the public knows on a personal level my reputation could could sort of poison instead I keep a distinction what I do is I try to aid the work of journalism but I am NOT myself a journalist your book is highly personal tell us about the price your then girlfriend now wife paid  your actions and how you feel she was miss portrayed in the eyes of the world when we got that first kind of thumbnail sketch of who she was so in the wake of the revelations of mass surveillance in 2013 this was suddenly the worlds biggest story in every country they were talking about the same thing and untunately that meant that everyone who was connected to me in some way they were also talking about because they were trying to say who I was where I came from and this untunately meant that Lindsey my lifelong partner was intensely investigated both by the FBI in the United States she didnt know what I was doing I could not tell her what I was doing because if I had they would have said she was an accessory to the crime they would have said she was part of a criminal conspiracy so long as she didnt immediately pick up the phone and say help help someones talking to a journalist and so this meant that I couldnt tell her she learned about what was going to happen the same way everybody else did about what is happening the same way everybody else did she saw me on TV which probably makes me the worst boyfriend in the history of the United States but she stuck by me and we are reunited and together today and I will never be able to repay her  the faith that shes shown me but the media had a tremendous amount of salacious reporting when they realized that she taught toll pole fitness classes which are quite popular  him in these days they called her a stripper even though shes never been one even though shes a poet even though shes a photographer they sexualized her they focused on her body they focus on her image because thats what got attention shes a much more complex and deep figure than the media ever gave her credit  she is more brave then anyone can possibly understand and shes more political and intelligent than any of these reporters at the time could appreciate her politics in fact influenced mine and Id like to think I learned as much from her or perhaps even more than she ever learned from me you paint a portrait of what some of us knew and that was that you were a thoroughly American kid in your upbringing you wake up every day in Russia you go to sleep every night in Russia are you actively seeking to get out are you as has been reported looking  asylum elsewhere well this is not an actively seeking this is not a new thing and this is important history especially  those people who dont like me  those people who doubt me who have heard terrible things about me it was never my intention to end up in Russia I was going to Latin America and my final destination was hopefully going to be Ecuador when the United States government heard that I had left Hong Kong where I met the journalists they canceled my passport they gave press conferences about it which meant I wasnt allowed to board my ongoing flight which was going to take me thats a Latin America rather than applying  Russian asylum rather than saying Ill play ball with any Russian intelligence service just please protect me I said no I will not cooperate with the Russian government or any government instead what I did as I was trapped  0 days in an airport I dont know a year longest layover is but 0 days was was a tough stint I applied  asylum in 27 different countries around the world traditional US allies places like France and Germany places like Norway that I felt the US government and the American public could be comtable that was fine  whistleblower being and yet every time one of these governments got close to opening their doors the phone would ring and theyre in their Foreign Ministries and on the other end of the line would be a very senior American official it was one of two people then Secretary of State John Kerry or then Vice President Joe Biden and they would say look we dont care what the law is we dont care if you can do this or not we understand the protecting whistleblowers and granting asylum as a matter of Human Rights and you could do this if you want to but if you protect this man if you let this guy out of Russia there will be consequences were not gonna say what theyre what theyre gonna be but there will be a response I continue to this day to say look if the United States government if these countries are willing to open the door that is not a hostile act that is the act of the front of a friend if anything if the United States government is so concerned about Russia right shouldnt they be happy  me to leave and yet we see theyre trying so hard to prevent me from leaving I would ask you why is that Im guessing Joe Biden is not your candidate  2020 actually I dont take a position on the 2020 race look its a difficult position being in the executive branch its a difficult position being in power and you have to make unpopular decisions I would like to think having seen now in 2019 that all of the allegations against me did not come true national security was not harmed as a result of these disclosures but they did win the Pulitzer Prize  public service journalism the laws were changed as a result the courts said these programs were unconstitutional we live in a safer and more secure world because the Internet is safer and more secure as a result of understanding these common vulnerabilities which not just US intelligence agencies were exploiting but our adversaries were exploiting one close these holes we do not become more vulnerable we become more secure in 2013 its fair to say some of these officials some of these candidates grow well the intelligence services are saying this guys dangerous theyre saying this is a risk theyre saying this shouldnt have happened in 2019 we can see that no evidence has ever been presented that the public understanding mass surveillance is real has caused any kind of harm whatsoever no one has died no terrorist attacks have succeeded because we knew about this stuff these programs work regardless of whether or not you know about them but we have seen the public benefits substantiated year after year after year and so Id like to think these people would reevaluate their position you know there are government officials who would push back very strong on your assertion that national security was not harmed you do you chose not to stop with your revelations at what was being done to Americans and you got into America and its allies and perceived enemies when were looking at the reports that were published in 2013 its important to understand I never published a single story the number of documents that I revealed is zero what I did was I collected an archive of material showing criminality or unethical or unconstitutional behavior on the part of the United States government I provided this archive to journalists who were required as a condition of access to this material not to publish any story because its interesting they could publish no story simply because its newsworthy they were only allowed as so far as the agreement went to publish stories that they were willing to stand up and say were in the public interest to know and this is not some crazy fly-by-night organization these are newspapers like the Washington Post like the New York Times like the Guardian and in every case this process was followed now as an extraordinary check on top of this in case I went too far in case I collected a document that was too hot or I misunderstood things or the jernt the journalists misunderstood things the journalists were further required to go to the government in advance of publication and they were required to do this at my request and warned the government this is the story that were gonna run this is what its about this is what were gonna say so the government could argue against it to create an adversarial check on what the journalists and I were trying to do to reconstruct the system of checks and balances in the United States that hid itself failed in the government you know because that process was followed so scrupulously thats why I am so confident that no harm happened no harm occurred now if there are those in the government that say harm took place if there are those in the government who say people have died I ask you this why havent they proved it you know better than anyone Brian that these government officials are more than happy to pick up a phone and make a leak to the New York Times every day of the week I if they had some evidence that somebody was hurt if they had evidence that a terrorist attack got through because of this journalism it would be in the front page of every newspaper in the world and despite six years of history thats never happened describe your life today what is every day like how are you supporting yourself and and as a simple equation if the Russians have reached so effectively into our lives and our electoral systems they must be all over your life so that was several different questions but yeah Im sure the Russian government is trying to spy on me Im sure the United States government is trying to spy on me everyones trying to spy on me the thing is I dont cooperate with them my allegiance is to my country my allegiance is to my Constitution now in my terms of my daily life its actually pretty ordinary Oh which is to say its not so interesting Ive always been something of an indoor cat right among nightclubs and partying my life since I was a child has always been mediated by a screen thats my choice so not much actually changes in my day-to-day whether Im living in New York or Berlin or Moscow in terms of my work which a lot of people are curious about this I think is a polite way of people asking do you work  the Russian government do you accept money from the Russian government you know are you living in Russian government housing are you in a bunker are there guards and of course the answer to all of these is no no Im not what I do  a living is speak professionally and now Im actually an author I have a speakers bureau its called the American program Bureau and you can call them and you can book a public event I speak at universities I speak at corporate events I speak at cybersecurity conferences to talk to people about what is happening on the internet what is the future of surveillance and how can we protect ourselves Im very tunate to have had that opportunity and its meant that Ive had a quite comtable life and in quite a difficult position the mer   aide HR Haldeman left us with an expression  the ages and when he said you cant put the toothpaste back in the tube  Americans who feel that that this is just a behemoth that they could theres no way they could have any control over it  Americans who long ago decided were just going to have to live with this surveillance how could it possibly be receded or rescinded or stopped we can stop a program we can thwart an attack we can make a device more secure but as you imply the system is still better the institutions and agencies and companies that produced these attacks that are creating new methods of spying every day will still be there the fundamental change not just in the United States but around the world that has to happen is we have to stop thinking about the limitations on how data is used as data protection regulations right now when we talk about what Google and Facebook are doing right now when we talk about what the NSA is doing right now when we talk about what rival governments are doing what the Russians are doing what the Chinese are doing what the North Koreans and the Iranians are doing were constantly thinking about all right this data has been collected and these companies have it how do we regulate their use regulating the use is a mistake we should do that but thats the wrong focus it is the collection of data that is a problem when you start trying to regulate use youre going to the collection has already happened the collection was already legal one of the fundamental flaws in u.s. privacy legislation is the fact that we are one of the only advanced democracies in the world that does not have any basic privacy law whatsoever we have the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution which is the reason that I came ward but that restricts what the federal government can do that restricts what the state governments can do it doesnt restrict what companies can do and as you know as everybody knows these companies are playing a bigger and bigger part in the world today we have to say all of these records that theyre creating about all of us all this control that theyre developing from these surveillance programs whether theyre saying theyre doing it  targeting advertisements or whether theyre doing it  targeting killings these records belong to the people that they are about not to the companies and this is a fundamental change that we have never discussed in a meaningful way broadly and publicly but we have to because all of these governments have said you know the the mass surveillance system why do we have it why is it useful they say because of terrorism they say its saving lives they save its oppressive anting attacks but no less than Barack  and the response to the 2013 revelations created two independent Commissions to investigate exactly the answer to that question were these programs effective in stopping terrorist attacks did these revelations cause harm to national security it was called the privacy and civil liberties oversight board and the presidents review group on intelligence and communications technologies and despite having an enormous budget despite having complete access to classified inmation despite the fact that they interviewed the heads of the FBI the NSA the CIA you know the full alphabet soup they found in the governments own words the kind of mass surveillance thats represented by this bulk collection program where the NSA was secretly collecting the phone records of every American and everybody else around the world every day under an authority provided by a secret court order that nobody even knew existed that program had never made their own words a concrete difference in a single counterterrorism investigation think about that more than 10 years of operation and secret never made a single concrete difference these programs mass surveillance is not about public safety it is not about terrorism it is about power it is about economic espionage it is about diplomatic manipulation and it is about social influence it is about understanding the actions of everyone in the world as carefully as they can no matter who they are no matter how innocent their life final question has to do with the Fourth Amendment we have it today because mr. Adams and others wanted to keep the British out of their homes and their horse carriages what would mr. Adams and the founders make of the reach of the government in your view into our lives given its humble beginnings I think if any of the founders of this country looked around today they would be shocked by the kind of rhetoric they hear and they would be shocked by the kind of activities of government they see if you read the Bill of Rights something that struck me when I was writing about it and in this book was that fully half of the first ten amendments are explicitly making the work of government harder theyre making life  law encement officials harder and all of the founding fathers thought that was a good idea because they recognized the more efficient a government is the more dangerous it is we want a government always that is not too efficient we want a government always that is just efficient enough because government holds extraordinary power in our lives we want government always to be using their powers in a way that is only necessary and proportionate to the threat presented by whoever it is that theyre investigating when the government is getting by by the skin of their teeth the people are free right the government should be afraid of the people people shouldnt be afraid of the government one of the ironies about the founding fathers  those who are skeptical of me which is fair again I dont want you to trust me and I want you to doubt me I want you to question me but I want you to look at the facts I want you to look beyond how you feel in the moment how we all feel in the moment and see what these stories said in 2013 see that the courts of the United States where Im being charged as a criminal said that the government itself was engaged in criminal activity look at these things and then remember the people who founded this country were called traitors the signing the writing of the Declaration of Independence was an outrageous act of treason it was criminal but it was also right the question whether or not I broke the law is less difficult and less interesting than whether you think what I did was right or wrong what is legal is not always the same as what is more final prediction then well let you go nightclubbing and that is do you predict do you predict you will at some point live out your life and die in the United States I think I will return when we look at the kind of things that were being said about me in 2013 the kind of hostility I face the kind of accusations I faced from the most senior officials in government and we look at the world today yes there are many still who dont like me but far far fewer because we have seen that all the harms that they alleged over the course of these years never came to pass they were never substantiated because they dont exist but the benefits are becoming more clear with each passing year the question that I think people have to answer whether you like me as person or not right whether you agree with how I did what I did whether you agree with the work of the journalists who decided what the public should know in order to cast their votes today you know the government broke the law today you know the United States government had broken that violated the Constitution and the rights of people in this country and around the world would you rather not know thank you and Snowden thank you very much good luck with the book thats my pleasure Brian thank you  having me hey there Im Chris Hayes from  thanks  watching  on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos were putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
13,0,". >>> WELCOME BACK TO FRIDAY NIGHT BROADCAST. LETS AGREE FOR THE SAKE OF THE NEXT CONVERSATION THAT DONALD TRUMP USES THE MOST COLORFUL LANGUAGE OF ANY PRESIDENT AT LEAST IN THE MODERN ERA AND SAYS SOME OF THE MOST QUESTIONABLE THINGS. AND THAT IS WHERE OUR NEXT GUEST COMES IN. JOHN IS A LINGUIST. HE HAS A PH.D.. HE TEACHES AT COLUMBIA. HE TOO IS COLORFUL WHEN TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND SPECIFICALLY HOW THIS PRESIDENT TALKS. THATS WHY WE TALKED ABOUT IT WITH JOHN McWHARTER. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU, BRIAN. >> IVE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU, WHAT IS YOUR LING WIS TICKS DEFINITION OF THIS PRESIDENT? >> DONALD TRUMP LINGUISTIKALLY IS UNADORNED. THIS IS THE BASICS. THIS IS WHAT LANGUAGE WAS UNDOUBLY LIKE WHEN IT FIRST EMERGED AMONG PEOPLE WHO DIDNT HAVE WRITING AND WERE FIRST GETTING THEIR VERBAL SEA LEGS. THIS IS WHERE IT STAR. AND SO IN THAT WAY, AS IN SO MANY OTHERS, DONALD TRUMP IS AN ORIGINAL. >> THAT WOULD MEAN THAT EDUCATION AND SCHOOLING HAS HAD NO EFFECT ON HIS USE OF LANGUAGE WAJ. HES QUICK TO REMIEPD US HE WENT TO THE BEST SCHOOLS. >> AND LEARNED NOTHING IN THEM. HE SPEAKS LIKE ONE WHO PAID NO EDUCATION TO ONE OF THE GOALS OF EDUCATION WHICH IS TO REFINE OUR SPEECH. HE USES THOSE SAME WAYS OF SPEAKING IN WHAT MOST OF US USED TO CONSIDER FORMAL. >> I THINK IN YOUR LINE OF WORK THEY CALL IT A TAG. WHEN SOMETHING IS ADDED TO THE END OF A TRADITIONAL SENTENCE. SO OFTEN HE WILL TAG A SENTENCE WITH BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE ME, AND ENFORCER. SOMETHING HE THOUGHT WAS LACKING IN THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE. >> UH-HUH. ITS THAT HES REINFORCING. ALSO HES USING ORAL SPEECH. WERE CHECKING TO SEE THAT THE OTHER PERSON WERE SAYING, THEYRE IN THE SAME BOAT WE ARE. THATS WHAT ""YOU KNOW IS, "" THINGS LIKE LOL IN TEXTING. HE DOES THAT, TOO, BUT ONCE AGAIN ITS NOT IN TEXTING, HES DOING IT IN FORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MEANS THAT HE NEVER LEAVES THE REALM OF THE CASUAL WHEN HE SPEAKS. WHICH IS UNLIKE EVEN SAY INDIGENOUS SOCIETIES WHERE THERES NO SUCH THING AS READ NG AND WRITING, THERES ALWAYS A HIGH AND LOW WAY OF TALKING. THE CHIEF DOESNT GET UP AND RUN HIS MOUTH, OURS DOES. >> THERES A FRIEND OF OUR BROADCAST WHO WORKS FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND SAYS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THERE ARE VISUAL AND AUDIO TELLS THAT HE PEPPERS HIS SPEECH WITH WHERE IF YOU KNOW WHATS COMING, YOU KNOW WHATS COMING.

14,0,"and good evening once again day 120 one of the Trump administration 133 days now remain until the presidential election as our nation grapples with a surge of new coronavirus outbreaks and as doctor foul Qi warned today we are now entering a critical two-week period Trump was back on the road this time in Arizona must-win State  him also happens to be one of the hot spots in our country just today according to the AZ central website Arizona set records in five separate categories new cases daily hospitalizations inpatient beds ICU beds and ventilators in use five new records Trumps agenda did not include anything on the ground related to the virus but did feature a photo op at his border wall then a speech at a students  Trump rally indoors at a megachurch in Phoenix it was his second indoor event in four days this time in a state where the virus is spiking again as it was in Oklahoma and note these pictures show the kind of indoor mass gathering we have not seen in this country since winter people sitting close together most of them not wearing masks its only the second indoor mass gathering in our country in four days and the president has presided over both of them like his speech at the Tulsa rally this one featured as n a phobic slur to describe the virus I said the other night theres never been anything where they have so many names I could give you 19 or 20 names  that right its get all different names Wuhan goo Hans was catching on coronavirus right come flu country Kovac Kovac 19 Kovac I said whats the 19 Kovac 19 some people cant explain what the 19 give me the Kovac 19 I said thats an odd name the 19 of course is about the Year 2019 when the virus was discovered tonight the Washington Post says seven states report record hospitalizations since the start of this pandemic as we mentioned Arizona but then Arkansas Calinia North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee Texas they all fall into that category about half the states in the nation are reporting a rise in virus infections heavily in the South and West now today what was in effect the first virus task ce meeting in two months except it took place during a congressional hearing dr. Anthony foul she issued this warning about the new outbreaks were now seeing a disturbing surge of infections one of the things is an increase in community spread and thats something that Im really quite concerned about right now the next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgeons that were seeing in Florida in Texas in Arizona and in other states foul she did add he believes theres a good chance we may have a vaccine by 2021 it cant come soon enough the virus has killed well over 100 21,000 of our fellow citizens it has sickened more than 2.3 million that we know of meanwhile both the president and members of his coronavirus task ce today face questions about Trumps comment at his Tulsa rally on Saturday when he ordered his people to slow down testing in order to reduce the number of new cases [] I dont get as a member of the task ce and my colleagues on the task ce to my knowledge I know  sure but to my knowledge none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing were gonna be doing more testing not less all of us have been and continue to be committed to increasing readily timely access to testing this afternoon and Phoenix Trump again made two more false assertions that contradict what were seeing and what weve heard from the medical experts were doing so well after the plague its going away theyll say we have more cases now look we want to do testing we want to do everything but they use it to make us look bad we do all these tests and we find pockets so we find people and we find cases and they say the cases of German meanwhile a new report from  Daily Beast co-authored by Sam Stein whos standing by to join us says task ce coordinator dr. deborah birx told the nations governors and a call on Monday that it was vital that they ramp up testing that comes as the New York Times reports what would be something of a switch a change in the power dynamic if you will the European Union considering blocking Americans from entering the EU because the US has failed to control the virus times also reports Saudi Arabia has effectively canceled the Hajj the annual pilgrimage to Mecca  what some scholars say may be the first time in its history amid all of this Trump is continuing to spread unsubstantiated allegations against voting by mail which many states already do and others are considering during this pandemic heres what he said about it just tonight the  are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail-in ballots using the China virus as the excuse  allowing people not to go to the polls Maryland ballots is a disaster  our country this will be in my opinion the most corrupt election in the history of our country and we cannot let this happen this is where you come in especially the part of your title that deals with preventive medicine and were happy to have you so here was the second largest indoor mass gathering since the arrival of a pandemic the first was just Saturday night in Tulsa as this crowd waited in the hot Sun they were hit by the mist machines that you often see in Arizona atomized water and blowing air past them while they were gathered in bunches outdoors this happened on a day as we said of five new records  this illness in the state of Arizona if the   had just talked to any number of the doctors who work  the federal government what do you think the advice would have been had they approached you what would your advice have been thank you so much  having me to clarify these issues when I see that video it leaves me feeling terrified because those are exactly the conditions that we identified early on in the pandemic that promote the spread of the pandemic theres a large number of people packed into a small space theres air flowing around pushing around potential coronavirus that could be circulating in that population and a real falsehood that Id really like to clear up is that the reason were seeing spikes is because of more testing our testing program right now is really the tip of the iceberg because were testing people who present with symptoms were testing people whove come in contact with people who have the corona virus what we dont know is how many a symptomatic individuals there are out there in the population and we cant know that number until were able to expand testing  randomly sample in the population so this this picture this image of these indoor rallies is terrifying  what its going to bring seven to 1 days later I want to play  you something your fellow Dartmouth grad Neil Katya all said today well talk about it on the other side I dont understand why bar hasnt been ced to testify I dont understand why the  of Representatives keeps on funding this justice department when they act in such a lawless way I dont understand why the subpoenas havent been issued yet so you know I think you know our the first and most culpable parties of course that the Justice Department and the president but I do think that the house has something to bear here and the Senate as well so my ahirat in Neils voice so much of this is done with such seeming brazen impunity will Congress get its courage on you know Congress needs to get its courage on because I think that the the urgency that you heard in Neils voice is absolutely right it cannot go unanswered we cant have literally we just watched mr. Berman the US Attorney  the Southern District of New York who was appointed by Donald Trump who was a person who contributed to Donald Trumps campaign but was behaving as far as we can tell as a neutral prosecutor get pushed out of the job and frankly a very suspect explanation about why we have the Michael Flynn situation in which Michael Flynn pleaded guilty on two separate occasions and now we see the bar Department of Justice essentially trying to unravel that prosecution and his own admission of guilt this is outrageous the  have to stop worrying about an election and start worrying about the Constitution because at the end of the day this is about whether we the people get represented to the degree that we should to protect the Constitution we have protesters in the streets saying we we are not receiving the equal protection of the laws at the same time that were watching essentially people who are a powerful who can sidle up to a president and claiming this friend getting all kinds of special favors when frankly theyre putting the country in a lot more danger than anything that we hear Donald Trump complaining about from protesters actually watching the presidents remarks from top to bottom I was waiting  the emergence of some messaging that might have stood out as an emerging theme in the campaign and I guess it was the the threat of bedlam as he mentioned it at one point that if the  are elected bedlam will come to all cities and towns in the United States he talked about the protest movement a lot in 2016 it was identity politics and nicknames that that that got him elected in the view of some as he looks at this next re-election having been robbed of the robust economy he thought he was going to run on is this kind of gonna look like what the campaign is absolutely Id be the the campaign right now and his aides and his advisors are very clearly as theyve told me casting about  a message he was robbed of the economy they arent quite able to paint Biden although the president is trying as sort of a liberal socialist antifa member thats just not who Joe Biden is and the president doesnt know where to land and so its created the situation where there is a ton of frustration between both the President and his campaign team in a lot of ways because if you listen to that whole speech there were some messages some scripted teleprompter messages embedded in there not necessarily devastating but are the sort of hits that his team wants him to land against Joe Biden but then the president does things like he he says he uses a racist phrase to describe the corona virus on the flu he talks about how he wants to slow testing down and that becomes the message and it derails everything so the campaign and advisers are furious with the president  being incapable of staying on message and hes furious with them because he feels you know you need to do your job you need to pack this stadium and when the president is casting about the final thing I will say is he doubles down on his gut instincts which is that sort of identity politics race politics dog whistle racially tinged and even racist language that were seeing right now"

16,0,[] [] thank you I mean that we could have poured that bee we got started missus this is just dead time only like Spica sure thank you very much Cheers yeah I thought I sort of flash back to the beginning of your career okay and asked if you always wanted to be involved in the comedy sphere when you were growing up and whether any particular showbiz icons that inspired you to go down this route well I did want to be in comedy from a very early age and I wanted actually to go to bear with me guys to go to Cambridge University alright because that was where John Cleese one of my big comedy heroes had started at the Cambridge Footlights permance review thing and this says a lot about my school that they said youre not going to get the grades  Cambridge but you could apply to Oxd because there was an entrance exam as an option which apparently there wasnt that Cambridge I dont remember so anyway so I decided that was I can do that instead so I was gonna apply to Oxd and so I came to Oxd with my parents and you know to do the kind of open day or whatever like I had to inspect Oxd to see if I thought it was good enough  me you know and and I remember I bought the t-shirt dude have you seen these t-shirts its its like it looks like the Guinness logo but instead of Guinness it says Oxd and underneath it says pure genius I imagine you all have them and all wear them and so I bought that t-shirt because Im a wanker and that was all I ended up with because they didnt they obviously I failed the exam which means that I didnt get to go to Oxd University which means youre all cleverer than me which seems absurd this guy is cleverer than me I can and better-looking its disgusting so so I ended up going to the University of Warwick and there at least I was able I did do a lot of kind of comedy related stuff so I did a radio show and Id make short films and I took a show to the Edinburgh Festival and I kind of you know like I jumped feet first into sort of extracurricular you know student stuff keen as I was to do comedy from that young age mm-hmm and early on in your career you sort of dabbled in stand-up you know as once common to that it was notoriously difficult yes what challenges did you find with that medium well the problem with any kind of comedy is that you can sit in your room particular with stand-up you can sit in your room and write it and try out in front of the mirror and youll just think youre absolutely killing it you know if its just you in the mirror I mean I was crushing it night after night I mean I just thought I was amazing and then you go out in front of an audience and you very quickly discover its much harder than it seems and untunately with stand-up theres no other way of trying out material you know you theres no machine that you can just try it that will tell you you know with a dial if its funny and so its tough you know because when youre starting out you maybe get five minutes to do material and you come out and youre nervous and if you screw up a line thats your shot at trying that joke out and then youve got a beg or steal another slot another Club another night you know it just takes a long time to sort of build up a head of steam and get the practice under your belt and all the rest of it and the first show I did I actually went well  the first five minutes and I just thought Im crushing this and then the following shall I did was terrible than I died on me arse and and I just realised it was much much harder than I realized and over the years Ive sort of you know Ive done it in a compact to it and Im gonna Im working on some more at the moment but it gets a little bit easier the more you do it and then the more experience you get its very counterintuitive stand-up so  instance if its not going well you have a tendency as many of us do when we get nervous to speed up right like were gonna just try and get through everything and actually the best thing to do is to slow down and take a sip of water and it just suggests that youre in charge you know and kind of eases everyone because one of the things with sound up is that the audience needs to be reassured that your income youre in charge because if you start to flounder they kind of over the audience because most audiences are on there on your side and they they sort of start to feel uncomtable and then that makes you feel uncomtable and then if everyones like this including the act on the stage then youre in trouble yeah and what song was the creative process behind some of your skits to stand up what sort of material did you draw upon often was it different every time you kind of go back to it no it was it was being from the west country and you know and lots of I mean it was lots of jokes about inbreeding all right I was young and then I hit on this this character I would go on as myself but the joke was that I was an arrogant comedian from the West country and so Id come on and Id be like yeah alright this is a Im here Im gonna do some groups  you I got some great material you know but I didnt like your attitude when I came on but its right would find that worry you know and I would very quickly the joke was that I sort of thought I was better than the club and I would never get to this routine I kept promising them this great routine but I never got there cuz I decided someone in the audience that annoyed me so Id be like you got seem to have an attitude and Im caught Ill come on again I want a bigger round of  and it would just it was like it was an act that never got started and when the audience went  it it was the best thing in the world it was amazing because they would they were onside they realized it was a character and everything you said the more insulting you were to them the more self-loathing you were the funnier it got and then I would sort of in the end Id say Im all right this is not gone as well as I hoped Im gonna leave Im gonna walk off I want a huge round of  so Im gonna walk off and dont speak to me if you see me in the bar ignore me and Id sort of I go to crap and theyd all pull out and Id walk off and Id leave it and it got quiet and then I would walk slowly back out and Id be like you cant go out that way and if they were on site it was amazing but if they werent on site if they didnt get the character I was fucked cuz I had no act and so they just thought I was an arrogant comedian from the West country so they were just they were just hair cool I mean I was I did a gig in exeter once when i remember someone actually shouting taxi  the comedian which i thought was a myth but they actually it was it was unbearable because i had nowhere to go and he its not like i could step out and go guys its a character i just had to keep going with it and it was brutal and so eventually i could have dropped that and i tried to sort of start being a bit more authentic and speaking as myself then when you heard  example white taxi  the comedian where did he find then the resilience to sort of carry on with you I didnt on that instance I remember a straight away afterwards phoning my agent and saying I cant do this anymore please get me out whole future geeks and um and he said well I cant youre booked in you know youve got fulfil your obligations and so then I went to the next gig the next day and it was in the darkest part of Cornwall and I thought well theres no way if the sophisticated people of Exeter didnt get this then theres no way Cornwall is gonna get it and Cole loved it and I was like Im clearly amazing it was just Exeter Im and every week we curve up and down you know and I be I know no Im not gonna do any 1k more gigs and so yeah it was it was it was a rollercoaster you then transitioned into radio work and then obviously at the podcast work  you did you find it hard to be funny with he have that comedic flare when sort of the only tool at your disposal was your voice and so how did you do that I think radio is much easier in a lot of ways partly because you dont see the audience and by you know it you know it can be intimidating if youre staring out a room of people not you people obviously but but if its if its a crowd and there is a certain although most British audiences I think are on your side they dont always show it you know if you perm in America and stand up on the whole even if theyve never heard of you there yeah this guy come on theyre on your side whereas in England even if they know who you are theres a sort of funny guy and its quite intimidating whereas with a radio audience obvious you cant see them and so it immediately relaxes you and also with I think with radio no ones expecting a work stand-up routine you know so you know if you think most DJs are a pretty name on the whole and and theres a lot of that kind of the time is fast approaching three oclock still to come we got tracks from storm Z and simply read I dont know what station that is but by the way the time cannot fast approach it can only just its always going at the same speed but but so if you are a little bit witty on top of that then then then youre the best thing that anyones ever heard and and plus youll can always play a record so if youve run out of steam you can play a record and get out of it so radio was was fun and that was where I met Ricky Gervais is in that kind of how we got started and radio is great because its very intimate you know I think people I guess podcasts do the same thing now but  years radio was a way of I dont know but you could privately engage with with people and they felt like you at the best they felt like you were a friend of theirs that they were listened to you know on a week on a weekly basis mm-hmm and then how did you solve work the material of n your podcast a british-based of a teacher ratio bee was this all pre-planned or was a kamal Ganic well when it was initially was just Ricky and I on a radio station and we would kind of have a quick chat beehand and then we would just make I was win along and then we got given this producer karl Pilkington and we asked him a question he was just there to press the buttons and make tea and things I get we asked him a question or he was telling a story or something and he said something about bar habla and the neighbors you know and they were the neighbors that had a horse in the living room anyway and we were like what do you mean anyway lets go back to the neighbors with the horse in the living room and  him that wasnt the interesting part of the story and we quickly realized that he was sort of dull dust you know and he and he just almost anything that you asked him was was just only because he just had this completely unique view of the world and you know we were we were talking once about celebrities who were only famous because of who their father is so Im in you know Calum best whose father was footballer George best ganker Gascoigne you know also and and we were saying theyre only famous because of who their dad is and Carl said why you could say the same thing about Jesus and and youre sort of like yeah I kind of make sense it away I remember we asked he wants to explain evolution and he said something like um evolutions easy you know its its you know its like slugs monkeys mermaids man and so um so he was just a he was just a never-ending you know supply of hes like if youd found a magic lamp you know and you could just rub it every week and just magic would come out really so then it really became a show about him really and and off we went and so there was never any planning there I mean it was just showing up and unwinding Carl up into the you know until he spoke of course you are very well known  the office what was the creative process behind that show and do you think theres a recipe of success that I can ensemble comedy show well the office came about because I realized when I was initially on the radio with Ricky that I was probably gonna get fired or both of us were gonna get fired because bee we worked with Carl we were on the radio on this London radio station called XFM and we were so essentially backroom boys who had to do jobs behind the scenes and went occasionally they let us on the air and I just sense that you know Ricky you know Ricky was probably gonna get us fired just because he never did any of the other work except  the radio bit he just he was lazy very lazy need hired me because I was gonna do the work and and so I sensed that we were in trouble so I got a job at the  when I was at the  I had to do this training film and the training film became this little if you like demo tape version of  Office and and  some reason it kind of it was good and Ricki was at brilliant and they just they were into it and they wanted us to make a pilot and then and wed never done anything I mean I was sort of 2 and Ricki was just fat and old and and and we started making demands you know like um well were gonna write this and hes gonna be in it and probably director as well produce it and I was mad thinking back and I think a lot of it was that Ricky was older and he he didnt care as but he wasnt so desperate to be famous or he kind of he was willing to walk away it was extraordinary its something that I was 2 and I had didnt have that confidence because I thought this was a huge opportunity and so he so Ricky would be like well get it then and Id be like well this wait a second lets talk about it Rick we can and I was sort of the negotiator and and they lets do it and and and I think because we were nobody and because there was no expectations and cuz no one knew who we were and cuz it was cheap and the  kind of were just allowing us to do it quietly in a corner of the  with no it no one sort of scrutinizing us I think because of that freedom um everything kind of came together because there was sort of almost no pressure you know and everything he or I or together have done since that its always scrutinized and theres a pressure and expectation and its judged against your previous work and everything else whereas when we first came along its like a new band that you know that people just like theyd like to get behind you know and and so I think its very hard to create that that recipe again you know of everyone in it was pretty much unknown and were amazing talents and so I think its plus I just think there was a sort of there was some kind of alchemy you know there was something that you just need to do good work that just the right elements came together and it was but it sort of no one goes into any project whether its that or Schindlers List or sharknado not seriously not trying to do a good job of work you know everyones trying to do could work its just really hard to do anything well and particularly your the pressure of being supervised and scrutinized whereas in that case we were just left to our own devices mm-hmm so when the showed them so transcendence across the pond how much influence would you have in the u.s. office and  you is it a bit strange to see characters that youve worked so hard like into to create or reimagine through a different lens well our first aware sense of being aware that it was even known in America and it was still only the British version only known among kind of comedy fans and people but we got nominated  a Golden Globe and we went to America and they picked us up in the airport in a limousine first time in a limousine I was like this is this is amazing and kind of there and its like free water and things free water I cant believe it and an ice tray and you can press buttons and the lights change on the ceiling and get to the hotel and then the  people there say theres absolutely no way youre gonna win a Golden Globe were like all right they said just enjoy the free water and everything so the day of the awards comes and the limo shows up and thats amazing how quickly you were climatized and youre like this limos not as nice as the other one does it shit and we pull up and were driving to the Golden Globes and Ricky decides yes I said to him I said to him eat something bee you go because you leave in the middle of the afternoon I said hes gonna be starving by four oclock sure enough he was so were pulling up to the awards bee we get to the awards he demands that we stop in a petrol station to buy the American version of whats its Cheetos she buys a big bag of Cheetos and he eats now in limo on the way and now hes covered in orange dust and are in sort of coloring all over his face and his fingers in a tuxedo and so now I have to get my handkerchief from my suit like putting that in the ice trade like wipe off the orange like a mum cleaning off a toddlers face and we pull up and ahead of us is the other Desperate wives getting out of a car Im thinking theres no way teri hatcher was cleaning orange dust off Eva Longorias face we go in there and the gold lives is very exciting because theres film stars as well as TV people and are in there its like Tom Cruise and Katie saw didnt its unbelievable and we get there and we are uh so the our category comes best sitcom and the nominations are read out over and the announcement comes in its us and no one was expecting us to win including us including the  who had told us youre not going to win and even the TV show because were so far back were liking their really crap seats like these guys at the back and and if you watch the footage the camera team cant even find us its like searching  us s playing and then eventually you sort of see me stand up confused and then sort of Ricky comes to there you know and then we sort of this motley crew make it our way to the stage and then the announcer whos no idea who we are it has to say our names and cuz Gervaise is its origin his french-canadian so I think hes just looking at these names and he just takes a guess and hes like welcome to the stage Ricky Gervais and Stephen Mitchell so if we get to the stage and Im not joking I remember looking out and seeing Clint Eastwood like where this guy is here and I saw Clint Eastwood in Eastwood turn to the person next to me when lip-reading its quite intimidating and and then they get late you know we won the award and then then Ricky won as well as a permer and suddenly you know youve gone there is just sort of tourists and youre kind of going to these parties afterwards like with you know two awards you and and and so suddenly people were coming up to us and kind of complimenting us on the show people you know samuel l.jackson or you know people that we subsequently asked to be in extras I follow show because we were just amazed that they were even aware of what the show was and then people came and they said look we you know wed like to maybe remake this  America and the only thing I knew was that a lot of previous British shows that they tried to remake had not worked and my guess was because the original people involved had kind of meddled and didnt know enough about American TV and so the one piece of I think sensible advice that I had to Ricky was I dont think we should do this ourselves because I think well fuck it up and so we found good people to take it over and and they are the ones that can should get the credit cuz they just ran with it and and Steve Carell was obviously amazing you know if it went and so the most we really do I mean we sat down with them  a week and kind of just tried to explain like whats the equivalent of so I its quite hard to explain to someone what equivalent of Slough is or theres just things you realize you dont like I didnt realize that pub quizzes arent really a thing in into the workplaces in America just a little weird things youd never even know about you know when off they went really yeah and was it hard to kind of let go of that or talk about the show really because it was to me it was like was like being a fan I could be a fan of this show that we had done and theree we could never enjoy from the outside and suddenly they would send us these episodes which were kind of our characters but done by better-looking people and it was a thrill it was Bernard ever never anything other than excited and proud of it yeah and then when you moved on to extras you earlier spoke about the fact theres then the added expectation of people knowing that like Jimmys merchant thats a dynamic duo how did he do an approach that new series and kind of stay grounded and not kind of get swept up in the hype what it was difficult because you know we were it wasnt that we wanted anything to do anything in particular about celebrities which is what the show ended up being about you know werent extras working on movies it was just we started finding area that all these amazing stars Kate Winslet and Ben Stiller and all these people we admired were fans of our show and were up  do it and theyd be like what do you want can we do something and so our original idea was to do a show about movie extras in which real stars were the extras so like it would be about extras but Kate Winslet be making a film but she would literally be walking around in the background never speaking and then that just thing once she agreed to do the show that seemed a bit perverse to not give her any lines at all so then we started writing its what scenes  them and then it was just amazing you know what they were willing to do and how far they were willing to go and and I suppose you know I think what what again because I was something of a fan of comedy like right back when I was younger John Cleese and people that I realized that its very hard to kind of keep topping what youve done bee its better in a way to almost go sideways and just do something else to sit alongside it and so that was sort of the aim I think  extras and everything else weve done really its just sort of to do something else rather than to try and do you know more and more versions or to try and do it something thats bigger and more high-profile and you know more successful in stuff and its very different tangent um comedy seems to sort of work in fads would like  example panel shows like how Ive gotten used to you dominating the arena currently what do you think that takes what makes something funny and why do you think we saw binge consumed certain categories of comedy at a time that is a good question I am I mean I think week when we came along there was a vogue  people reacting to the more traditional sitcom style the stuff thats shot in front of a live audience and that quite broad and often great but but a little bit you know more knock about and I think people were ready  something probably that was a little bit more realistic and loaf I and low-key and naturalistic and certainly that you know there was us and there was the royal family and there were these other shows and then I think probably somewhere on the line theres been a reaction to that again right and so now you have the biggest show British comedy show is mrs. Browns boys which is extruding it I just but it just seems like it lives in another world like its its so far from what we did so I guess maybe theres a turn back away from that to something more silly if you like and knock about and colorful and jokey and you know and surreal whatever you want to call it and that and then presumably therell be a reaction to that and theyll go back to something else so I think Im I also think that you know we were in a period where we we could be kind of edgier if you like we were we were sort of we were trying to talk about real things and trying to reflect the office worlds wed seen or the real worlds wed seen in that it could be awkward and make you cringe and be uncomtable and talk about you know real things and I think I sometimes wonder now whether they whether theyd let us do the office you know in the way we did it I wonder if we would have been censored more because I feel like we were living in an age where there is a little bit more sensitive to things and maybe we wouldnt get away with it I dont know and kind of been in that vein especially with an Idiot Abroad the humour is known to be slightly more tongue-in-cheek not anymore offensive no I dont mean that disingenuously I think cuz to me Karl is so its like a sort of idiot manchild its a heart its like if a child said something offensive it seems harder to take it seriously if you know what I mean and I think because of knowing Karl that is sort of how I how I take it but I can certainly see from the outside it looks do you think in perhaps like a slightly more politically correct world its harder  comedians to soar do their job because theyre having constantly tread the line and evaluate whether they are being offensive as opposed to just trying to be funny well its tricky isnt it because Carl you know  instance just to take Carl as an example in that show you know hes traveling the world and hes reacting authentically to the world around him and he doesnt hes ignorant I mean he is the little Englander personified you know hes a man Im not joking who takes little banks of teabags when he goes to you know Mauritius or something  two weeks you know he like my parents might you know hes hes someone who you know you hes someone who could go on holiday when he chooses to go on a holiday and immediately look  a cafe that serves the following leash breakfast you know while in Spain and I think theree if you send him to far-flung places he reacts you know in an authentic way thats not him trying to fish  the controversial thing to say I think he is just reacting and I think its not only think its born from prejudice I think a lot of it is born from ignorance or naivety and I think sometimes that lands him into hot water and other times its sort of its weirdly sweet I remember him visiting there you know the the the wall that divides you know Israel from Palestine and him just kind of just baffled by it like it was so hes just like its so ugly I dont understand like he just he doesnt understand the nuance of that debate so to him hes just this like a child seeing this monstrosity and kind of not understanding it so you know its really its sweet in a way in terms of a if you like a smarter comedian choosing to wade into controversial territory I mean I dont know I mean I think you I think if you police yourself you you can be in danger of just being very Hannah dying because someone will always be offended by something you know I dont think that means you dont have responsibility I think you know its your responsibility you know theres that famous quote whatever you freedom of speech doesnt extend to shouting fire in a crowded theater you know  a laugh and I think thats true but I do think I do think theres in a way theres almost an exchange between an audience and a permer you know and that if the permer if the audience chooses to take offense then theyre well within their rights to do that but I dont know if that means they can shut down or sense of the person on the stage you know and its tricky you know censorships a tricky thing because where does it stop you know do you allow people with the most horrendous views of public platm I dont know I mean I I dont I dont never understood the answer to that one I just think in the end you you know you have to be responsible  your actions and if you cause offence then you choose to either apologize or not and thats up to you I guess but I dont know if its funny you talk about political correctness because it feels like that was exactly the thing that was in the air when we did the office you know it was political correctness was this sort of buzzword you know and to us that show was about a man trying to navigate that and not understanding kind of what the rules are or why what he thought was liberal was not you know or why he cant go up to a black guy and go tell you I love Sidney Poitier why he thought white to him that was that was a good thing to do why would you not why whats wrong with that you know and I suppose you on the surface you could look at that and go well it does that make the show racist well I would argue that the character is misguided and prejudiced but that doesnt mean the show is and I think with a lot of commit comedy in particular you can talk about difficult areas and tough subject matter without that necessarily meaning that you subscribe to the the offensive line of thought you know its really tough yes so then kind of in that vein of comedy being able to talk to a specific topic perhaps more than something else when you have then shows like Trevor Noah  example where he uses comedy to tackle really really deep issues do you think that were slightly over politicizing entertainment and comedy and it should actually sometimes just be a place of escapism or do you think its now a duty  some comedians to use their power of being funny to illuminate issues that otherwise where he cant be done as well well I think I think that theres always been a place  satire I would sort of put Trevor and and you know a lot of those late-night American talk show hosts in that category of satirist s-- as much as anything um theres always been a long heritage of that and thats I think always to be applauded I do think though whats interesting is it generally is left-leaning satire on the whole and it might be interesting if if that was mixed up a little bit more and you had kind of right and left doing battle a little bit more in the same environment because I think there is that feeling that you know that Trevor Noah Jon Stewart bee him those late-night host Stephen Colbert theyre slightly preaching to the choir you know and to me it kind of would be interesting to see them sort of going head to head with people on the other side of the fence because I think that would just generate some interesting sparks creatively and also I think it might welcome in people from the other side of the argument who might then themselves learn a little bit more from the side of the fence theyre not on you know and so um you know the when you when you attack Donald Trump however justify we might feel that is its not moving the dial is it clearly because his fan base are not even aware of those jokes or theyre just dismiss them out of hand and so theres a you know theres a great value in satire and thank God its there because we all go crazy without it but it feels like its voicing what we are feeling and letting us feel better that someone agrees with us and shares our pain rather than it making any change you know I mean I remember with the office you know people would come up to Ricky in the street and theyd be like oh that boss you play Im just like him see you later like they were proud of that they didnt see it as a that we were mocking him necessarily you know so we used to say we havent changed anything people who still assholes final question  me if I just open up to the audience so you recently starred in Logan and that was slightly more serious dramatic role compared to your previous ones do you sort of want to dabble in that area more and what was your experience from working on a blockbuster set well I definitely would like to do more drama Ive always had an interest in there and I think you know even with the stuff weve done in the past weve tried to add some dramatic elements here and there and put me Ive just done written and directed a film which is more of a drugs gonna draw comedy-drama I suppose which is about a real-life family of wrestlers from Norwich and it was it came about because Im a dear friend Dwayne the rock Johnson hes friends with all of us he he was in England making a film he was watching a channel  which I just think its amazing the image of him in a hotel like in a Travel Lodge or whatever wearing you know the theres you know the free kind of what you call it the free years of dressing-gown you know its just a little bit too short on Dwayne you know is Johnson is visible to the world and easy in the shortbread and flipping through channel  and hes waiting  Grand Designs and this documentary comes on about this family restless and he desire dad work within bee any any contact to me was like I think theres maybe a film in this and so I went to meet this family of Norwich wrestlers and um theyre a whole family of the mum dad three kids and they all do that wrestling you know in that sort of WWE phony version of wrestling but its not in the WWE in America its in Norwich and the surrounding areas in real town halls and the dark dad is a mer um armed robber who kind of found wrestling and it sort of saved him like some people are saved by religion and hes got these three kids and the to two of the teenage kids brother and sister auditioned  the WWE which is the big leagues of wrestling  a British person and only the daughter got signed so she went off to the States and had to train with them and meanwhile her brother got left behind and he in essence is sort of you know he it was very hard  him to deal with the pain of of that of being of that rejection and so you know the story on the surface you think its just going to be this sort of silly knocking about thing about this kind of eccentric firmly but actually it so it becomes hopefully quite moving story of how you deal with kind of rejection when the dream that youve pursued all your life that youve been indoctrinated to do with by your parents doesnt come doesnt come off you know and and so just finish that and I think you know it its that sort of it feels like where my heart is moving in terms of still using humor but kind of showing the flip of things because I think so much with comedy you know if you took away the  it would be tragic and bleak and in an interesting way you know so anyway so thats where were heading thank you um now to open questions to the audience so if you stand up once you say your question and wait  the mic yeah remember in the orange top hi Im thank you so much  coming today this has been so fun already my question involves working with the very a list celebrities on extras my favorite part about the show is how self-deprecating you guys ended up getting them to be and I think some more than others so how was that process was it a process of collaboration did Patrick Stewart  example suggest wanting to see everything right yes well he asked the amazing thing was we would come up with these ideas and I was just amazed at how often they would say they would agree you know and the the Patrick Stewart idea was that he would had written a script that he was trying to get made with in the show which I think it made in wedgy it was essentially just an excuse  him to see women naked clearly and in every version of the script hed be like you know Im riding on my bike and then you know I look at posh spice and then our clothes fall off and I ride on it and just sort of like you have this shit classically-trained Shakespearean actor with this rich voice talking like a child and you know and then youd get you contacted his agent and get him on the phone and explain this idea I need to go quiet I mean its like what and Riki somehow got hold of David Bowies number or hed met David Bowie somewhere or David Bowie how if you want to say and Im I remember he said he phoned David Bowie and I think theyve had a real Im speakerphone I can remember and he said Bowie answered things like um or honor it Im just eating a banana and to us were like what David Bowie eats bananas ie bananas its just the idea that hes at home with his supermodel wife in Monaco any bananas and and its amazing how quickly you sort of realize theyre actually actors on the whole they still want to act and do fun stuff you know and and that you know if youre on a film its a big blockbuster film it could be months and months and youre stuck and you do very little acting and mainly waiting around whereas  us we promised them you know youll be in and out a couple of days youll have a laugh if we found any ideas you have  him in the mix theyd be like yeah great so you know theyd show up and theres almost nothing they wouldnt they wouldnt do I cant remember them even saying that it is almost always that they had a scheduling conflict rather than that I think there was a childrens entertainer that was popular when I was a kid called Keith Harris who had a green bird called Oroville that he was mentally equipped and we asked him if he would be in any and he read the script and said it was the most fucking disgusting thing hed ever read was he I know if that was him or or Orville that said that but he he refused to do it but but everyone else was on board extraordinary I know I still dont know how that happened really its baffling remember in the brown jacket so your timer XFM is often seen as being soft the beginning of the podcast era yeah and helping sort of pioneer this new sort of resurgence of radio maybe in a new m of entertainment are you proud of that sort of cultural legacy did you have anything anywhere that size in mind when you start out well I its funny you know as you walk around the Union you see those pictures of you know pioneers in various fields like um you know Einstein and Malcolm X and we got karl Pilkington to talk about eating penises you know when hes in the jungle so yes a pioneer in every but I didnt know what a podcast was and and Ricky suggested theres this new thing where you know you download it straight to your iPod at the time whatever okay Ive no idea and we started doing them and and then it was fun because you had none of the restrictions of radio its obviously with radio is still restricted in what you can say within reason with a podcast at the time you had gloves off you could say anything and and it just suddenly we were in the Guinness Book of Records  the number of donors I mean thats because there was literally no one else doing it so its easy to win a road record when no one else is doing it but um but now as a pot as a keen podcast fan I love it Im very proud that we were sort of that we were kind of ahead of the curve on that and its funny Ive done peoples podcasts since and theyve talked about ours as being kind of instructive and inmative  them and Ive met people you know I was in Vietnam I met people listening to the podcast and people all over the world because theres sort of something is a great democratization with that you can just download it from there anywhere in the world and listen and and and thats I think one of the most exciting things about media now that there are since when I began is that its just its kind of wide open its like an international field do you know if you want to do a podcast about you know I dont know that the nerdiest weirdest I mean I just did one recently that David with your hosts that oh there is only about David Bowie thats all they talk about just Dave about it from weeks hours at a time of just just Dave about it and theres people listening you know because theres enough fans and I think that sort of extraordinary and its a bit like in the way that the internet seems to have opened up every possible sexual perversion that anyone want like whatever crazy perversion I want addresses and know why I do right yeah theres four million other people that want to do the same things not Ive googled not known you know I mean you can just reach out you can find kind of almost anyone thats interested in what youre interested in thanks to the the web and so yeah I love podcast Im proud that we were part of it the member in the aisle so Ive so Ive earned up if youre gonna talk to me okay I watched the American version of  Office and its influence on me has largely been that I now you know imagine hell as being stuck in the universe of that show yeah but so you said that you that the success of your original show was rather unexpected so Im just wondering sort of in retrospect what do you think made the show so successful well I think um we discover you know about 0% of this country works in an office apparently and Im sure thats true of most of sort of you know the sort of industrialized world and and so theree I think that that immediately theres something relatable about just that as a working environment and then I think um we tried to be as authentic as possible we spent a lot of time literally sitting talking about people wed work with in other offices and it seemed to us there was always this sort of guy who you know at the time wore his mobile phone on his belt and always had his laminated security pass and was a real kind of jobsworth you know across the ts dot the is type and we knew we needed someone like that and we there was the boss who wanted to be a friend but was also the boss and was trying too hard and we both worked in places where those people existed and the guy thats just trying to get through the days you know and perhaps didnt really want that job but its just sort of wound up there and um and then you know it just turned out that those people are in every country and started in America but they we did a French version and a french-canadian version of an Israeli version in a theres a South American version in and I think that Im not joking that the Germans did a version without asking permission not like the Germans to take something without asking but um but anyway given get but but yes so it clearly there was something that was that was very relatable you know and even though you could change it  sort of regional specifics that the core of it I guess was relatable you know but again I you know I think if wed sat out to do that wed have never achieved it remember in the front row in the beauty shop thanks  coming one of my favorite parts or several parts in an Idiot Abroad is when you guys push Karl seemingly over the limit of having him stay places that he genuinely looks unhappy or the whole bungee-jumping skit how much of that is real and how much did he know was coming when he signed up to it I think in the first series he did not know what was coming ever and he was genuinely alarmed and theres a lot on the cutting room floor of him just just angry not entertaining  anybody its just him I think by the second series in order to persuade him to go we didnt tell in the specifics but we would give hints just because he just refused to go otherwise but normally the limits if we were pushing into the limits that was not him playing acting that was him almost sort of trying to negotiate with the producers you know as to exactly I mean the bungee jumping you know I mean we wanted him to do the full bungee jump and he refused and he does some tiny little and I get if he does it doesnt he just jump off like a from like a foot you jump jumps from there to there he was pathetic and so now and then he goes ultimately he and hes doing his own stuff now because he doesnt want to share the money with us or sensibly be tortured without him knowing because thats the thing you know once you make someone a celebrity they then have a lot of power and they can turn around and go now why on earth would I eat a sheeps penis in the jungle you know so but no but its not its not him its not him - turning it on  the cameras really its not its not manufactured in that way yeah yeah remember in the flu shot hi there so as a gamer Im a really big fan of your permances Wheatley in Portal 2 thank you and so I was curious whether what was your experience like working with a big name like valve and did it encourage you to work further in the gaming industry well I did this voice  this video game called portal 2 which I had no idea about portal or portal 1 or any of that stuff having given up gaming just after University I think in university Im a good deal gamer now because I think afterwards when you do a real job you dont have quite as much time to game as Ive discovered so I kind of stopped doing it untunate because I just at the time but um so I by the time I got to do it Id sort of you know cuz I was really into games  a while but I just I didnt know whats going on anymore and then they said that this had been a big game would you like to do it whatever it go that I liked video games that seemed like a fun thing to do and what I hadnt anticipated is that when you do a video game you you you dont just do the voice  every  just the route through the game you have to do every possible Avenue that the gamer like you might take lets assume youre a terrible gamer and that half the time youre just like you know walking into a wall and you dont know how to sort of turn him around then I have to do all the voice Bert youre walking into a wall you dig what youre doing turn around nob you know just have to do that  every possible idiot thing that you might do playing a game you know do your studies you lose there or whatever it might be and and so it was exhausting it was crazy because you just went on four days of just every possible route but but the freedom on the flip of that was that they were very open to just letting me kind of ad-lib and play around and sort of insult the player and things and and afterwards it turned out it was really good fun and there are people that because of great thing about video games they sort of sit there and some of them just you know are getting people are discovering them all the time and playing them all the time bit like podcasts and so I still get you know people all the time sending me pictures of the game or knitting me little little dolls of Wheatley and and its wonderful because I sort of Id gotten just how vast the gaming community is and sort of if youre not playing it all the time you kind of it slightly slips off your radar and you know famously the gaming industry is its its a much bigger industry than the film or TV industry and its a billion dollar industry and you realize its just this again a swathe of fans all over the world who  whom you know and theyve sort of spend I dont know how long it took you to play that game but I would imagine its you know its a couple of days or whatever I dont know and so youre just there its just you talking to them you become like a friend so its great I would happily do it again I havent been asked to do again but but it was good yeah and thats the thing is I kind of like you know its times gone on and opportunities have arisen I Im I just like kind of like to follow the opportunities that come and I would never thought about video games but he came along and it was and it was something that was fun to do and its funny like when I was younger and I would look at peoples career its like John Cleese and I think you know why did they do that and why did they choose them what a weird what and then you realize its just sometimes fun things come along or you try something it doesnt work or whatever you know that its very few people that can have a master plan of of kind of what their career is going to be dated the member in the floral shop hey thank you I had a question actually about this to humor that you have because in the shows and in the podcast love the humor revolves around physical appearance whether its Carls head or in the office with the augment stare so how did that arise was that something that you just found to be effective and then how do you not take it personally when it like does it ever go too far yes yes well I guess you know what the world reasons I got into comedy was I remember you know at school feeling I mean I was six-foot-seven by a young age you know and so I was I was talking to some guys bee about how I used to really enjoy dancing in kind of clubs and pubs and places with other people you know not just not just get out dance and and I remember I say to these guys like you know I was dancing once I you know because I got the moves they come on and and I caught my reflection in a mirror dance  a wall and I realized that I was about two feet taller than everybody else dancing and I suddenly really self-conscious as I looked like um like a substitute teacher you know at the school disco whos there to something you know its just it was really weird and I just I became pretty self-conscious about that and I think um when you are very tall than if youve got glasses or whatever or you I dont know you when youre a teenager you know you have those those insecurities and and I remember someone saying to me once in an interview do you think you use humor to control when people laugh at you and right that might be true that might be just a fancy way of saying it but I think theres some truth in that and I think because I always sort of felt a little bit awkward in that way it seemed natural to make fun of the way I looked or the height or whatever sort of bee anyone else did and then as we moved into working with other people you know certainly when I met Ricky he was short and fat and in my mind old in actual fact he was younger than I am now but there we are and you know Karl obviously does have a head like a fucking orange so you mean you use what you can have plus also just sort of physicality is some you know using your body particularly if your toy no I think just it its fun I tried to do that in this American show I did how the ladies would have just used the physicality of you know like this whole sequence where I was outside a club and they wouldnt let me in and they were talking about the kind of that red velvet rope they have to let you in and out and obviously  me I can just step over it really easily and I was just playing with that harlot because its sort of absurd that this barrier Im in and Im out you know and just so thats thats always a joy to do I mean I dont I dont I think weve very weve never picked on someones physically that they didnt give us permission to to joke about you know I mean so we dont spring it on anyone so if there was any jokes in in any of the shows we did that the people were always on board with that because yes he is a hurtful if summons thats the terrible thing is that I can joke about my height and Ive given permission to Ricky in car but if anyone else makes a joke Im furious you know I mean just you know and again the weird thing about height is people its seen as an achievement you know fuck you know youre tall you like you prick like Im supposed to go well thank you sir I appreciate and so um and so yeah it was not a day goes by when someone doesnt kind of mention it or talk about it and so I figured like you know what I cant pretend its not a thing I think what was more insulting was when they asked me to do Logan they say would you like to be in a superhero movie and Im like bigger than the gym finally the calls come and Ive youve not seen the film I play a giant albino or Albee no mutant with you know terrible skin a shaved pale head freakishly tall weird eyes I mean it was it was typecasting and so yeah I mean I think the only reason I got that role is theres not a lot of six-foot-seven freaks in Hollywood you could save them a tune on the prosthetics or CGI its just annoying I didnt get to do Gollum I could have been absolute shoo-in  Gollum the precious or whatever I dont see yeah remember in the communist Thanks I wondered how your relationship with Ricky has changed over the years too many now hes seen as kind of a slightly different persona at least publicly right now than he used to be well im i dont know i mean i think the the disparity between kind of Rickys public image and his real image is one that because when you do stand up you and comedy you you sort of blur that line because you use your name but youre magnifying or exaggerating or taking positions on things you know I mean even someone as seemingly safe as Michael McIntyre Im sure hes not as furious about you know airports as hes pretending to be you know hes probably getting by like most of us in an airport pretty easily its just that you know hell magnify his frustrations  a comic effect and certainly Ricky does that and I think in the age of social media he does that even more I think hed like hes always liked sort of provoking hes always had a kind of sort of punk rock edge to him even from when I when we were first working together that idea of sort of you know theres a famous interview with the Sex Pistols you know where they kind of are on this bill Grundy TV show and kind of you know causing trouble and I think this is a little part of Ricky that likes that that like its kind of prodding and getting a reaction which I dont really have in the same way I think Ive always quite liked the idea of just slipping on Im just Im here Im just gonna sneak out the back guys you know and so I think probably just as hes got more well known you know that sort of has come to the e and hes sort of hes indulged that more but I think you know when you work with him or you know him I mean he sort of is its just you know hes hard-working and hes very reflective and hes very thoughtful he doesnt you know hes not hes not that person that hes not that its not his ship if you know what I mean so um you know I dont know I mean its hard its yeah I Ive not done a sort of enough of an analysis to say but certainly I used to joke with him I used to say you know Rick someone asked me if celebrity has changed you and I told them know youve always been a cunt but that stemmed more from the fact that he had very difficult eating habits he just would he was hes got that appetite of a child and so we would just spend hours of writing time wandering around looking  you know baked beans on toast or fish fingers fish fingers are quite hard to find sometimes in in North London  lunch so that was my main objection to him and when I first knew him he was very consuming he was very lazy which has changed the memory in the blue t-shirt very hi Steve big fan especially your ex femme work building on the previous question I was wondering if you would still consider working with Ricky or possibly Carl and feature I would do yeah absolutely yes theres not theres no theres no reason not to I think I think certainly with the radio stuff of the podcasts we just you know we did a lot of hours of that in the end I mean I wouldnt want to talk them up but you know we did the radio show every week  you know thats 2 or 3 hours at a time and we did that  quite a few years on and off we did a lot of the podcasts and thats a lot of time speaking in a room with each other and you just at some point you start to feel like youre going over the ground you know and even as someone as rich and genie in a lamp as as Carl theres only so many times you can go back to that well without it starting to feel like you know overkill but yeah if I mean we used to push what we should try to get Carl to do tour torrents you know like university tours and three of us would sit and you know we knew you guys could ask him questions and we never we never do it he was always fearful of going out on the road or and so that was a bit of a missed opportunity because that would have been fun and maybe thats how we could still do in the future that Beefalo thing what about a TV show or a film with ricky yeah possibly i mean i think i think a lot of it comes to me comes down in part because were sort of in different parts of the world a lot i spend a lot of time in LA and hes in London or in New York and also I think you know we work together again sort of pretty cheap by channel  over ten years and I think its just that feeling of slightly kind of having different of being pulled in different directions clearly you know sort of I feel like you know like youre saying with the drama I could have werent interested in that and not that hes not but I think generally he wants to perm in the stuff he does and I feel like Im quite happy to from neither of us to perm and to let other people perm and I think its just not quite something hes interested in and because I think a lot of Rickys humor is about him putting it across and him presenting it which is why hes so good at stand-up whereas Im kind of more interested I think a little bit more in their sort of nuts and bolts of making stuff and and I think also hes quite he likes to just get stuff done you know he just hes impatient he likes to just do it whereas I kind of are happily spend months years kind of grinding it out you know so I think if the right idea was there Ill be good to do something but at the moment theres nothing on the horizon okay I mean we have time  about two more questions so would you like to make the last tip I just down Id Id hate to upset someone please know you can do a great job can I remember in the Navy jumper are there any British comedies that you particularly enjoy at the moment British comedies I enjoy at the moment well I dont watch a lot of stuff only because I always feel like Im gonna get jealous if its really good you know I genuinely do like I like hum whats that I get its name as it called them people that dont do nothing or a people only do nothing nor is that whats it called you know the one I mean whats it cool people dont do nothing yeah which i think is great a camera or its name but I love it I think its really funny I just I know theres loads of great stuff people keep raving about I just havent I just dont watch anything weirdly I watch a lot more and I dont know I think maybe with comedy I just feel it either Im gonna be jealous because its so good or Im gonna be there sort of thinking I wouldve done it like there and you know the mean so no I just nobody knows I dont know whats going on it was a comedy I havent heard this Ive just seen clips of it and it looks terrific it looks brilliant yeah I saw a great thing with someone trying to put a wheelbarrow of rubbish in it you know skip from that show that was absolutely hysterical where hes somehow is he somehow is that his legs end up on the to plank I got its but its brilliant google it geez Im not even screaming but that looked great that looks really good look brilliant its just weird sort of you know with things like that when people mention it to me they say oh you know theyve obviously been inspired by the office you just think thats so weird that you know were the sort of granddads of comedy now you know in I mean its just so depressing but ya know otherwise I dont really see much I feel bad I thanks  coming um I think that one of the highlights of extras was your relationship with Barry and I was just wondering how that came about and how you kept him Barry from EastEnders of everyone yeah you know I cannot remember how an earth that came about why on earth did we think we could take a night to have been in EastEnders and say youre gonna be in our show youre gonna get no work were gonna just portray you as a complete loser and I will be your agent and Im gonna pretend I dont even remember your real name I cant I mean I thats what how on earth did we suggest that to him I cant remember whether had he met him somewhere I cant remember but um clearly he agreed to do it and he is Shawn Williams that hes an absolute joy that man hes just hes hes the nicest man in the world and he does nothing you can say to him that he wont do you know Shawn youre gonna get caught ranking over a nudie pen yeah sure Ill see you Tuesday and in fact recently he got married he got married again and and so I sent him a video that I did as my agent character just wishing him well  his wedding but saying about how Im furious Im being in what Ive heard youre doing a wedding I dont know much you getting paid but I should be getting a cut of that you know and then it was great Im really pleased hes amazing hes great and thats what I mean its just to so many people that means people weve worked with that I just I could you know we could write whole series just  them you know because theyre so theyre so talented theres such a roster of talent in this country its amazing but how on earth we persuaded him to do it I have no idea Dean Dean Gotham Im calling Dean Gaffney youre gonna be again were gonna say youre a loser you cant get any work youre working in  Carphone Warehouse yeah fine nobody I think thats all we have time   today but could everyone please join me in thanking Steven  such you
19,0,"[] [] well thats one of the more positive welcomes Ive had from you alright yeah thank you  coming if youd like to give a few opening remarks and then well move on to some questions okay so I have about half an hour  this I guess about 1 to 20 minutes  the open case so I think Im going to talk to you today a little bit about hierarchy its a small talk that Ive been developing as Ive been doing my public lectures over the last couple of weeks its an elaboration of some of the ideas I put th in on some of my scientific writings and in maps of meaning but more particularly in 12 rules  life in rule one which is stand up straight with your shoulders back and its in part of meditation on hierarchy and I want to talk about the political significance of that and let you know how Ive been trying to sort that out in my own imagination so Im gonna put and I think it sheds light on on the political on the nature of political debate itself and maybe deeper light on why temperamental factors might contribute to political political framing and perception because we know that people tend to vote their temperament although there there are other reasons that influence their political allegiance and their voting behavior so lets start with a couple of simple observations and the first is that complex biological creatures and even simple biological creatures  that matter have to move ward in the world and so thats the case  any creature thats mobile and that goes all the way down to one celled organisms the idea that approach and avoidance are the fundamental motivations is a very old biological idea and seems to apply across levels of analysis in the in in the animal kingdom and and its true  us as well and we have to move ward towards things because we have requirements there are things that we require to keep us alive and to keep us wanting to be alive as well and those are different things and we move ward towards things that we value so theres two propositions there the first is that we have to move ward because there are things to move ward to because there are things we need and want and the second is that to move ward towards something is simultaneously to value it and so one of the implications of that is that we always live in a framework a value theres no escaping that and that were moved  our detail that this out quite substantially in my book maps of meaning but were always at a place and and and were always moving towards a place that in principle has some advantage over the place were at otherwise we move towards it and so what that means is that theres no life without value at least theres no human life without value out of necessity and also not only out of necessity at the physiological level but also out of necessity at the psychological level because another thing that you might point out that I think its usefully pointed out is that not only do you have to move from point A to B in life but point a is often a very difficult place to be because were fragile and bounded and mortal and limited and because we know that and so one of the implications of that as many great religious traditions are at pains to illustrate or demonstrate or proclaim is that life is essentially suffering and I believe that to be a fundamental truth but but perhaps not the most fundamental truth because I think the most fundamental truth is that despite the fact that life is suffering people can transcend that and partly the way they transcend that is by pursuing things of value and so that if there is no value proposition at hand then you have no meaning to justify the difficult conditions of your life and thats brutally difficult  people no Nietzsche said he who has a why can bear anyhow and you see and Ive certainly seen this as a clinical practitioner that people who have no purpose in their life are embittered by the difficulties of their life and they become first bitter and then resentful and then revengeful and then cruel and theres plenty of places to go past cruel thats just where you start if youre really on a downhill path alright so those are the first propositions the second proposition would be well if youre going to pursue something of value because youre a social creature youre going to pursue that thing of value in a social space and that means youre going to compete and cooperate with people around you in the pursuit of that value and what that inevitably means is that given that the pursuit of anything valuable is going to be a collective enterprise that youre going to produce a hierarchy or maybe more than one hierarchy but at least a hierarchy of competence in relationship to that pursuit so it doesnt matter what you decide to pursue maybe youre going to do that cooperatively youre going to find that you and other people vary in your ability to manage that pursuit effectively and and efficiently and so theres going to be a hierarchy of people from those who are very good at the pursuit maybe its pole vaulting maybe its delivering massages maybe its delivering groceries maybe its setting up an enterprise it doesnt matter but if its a valuable Purdue pursuit and you pursue it socially gonna produce a hierarchy and the hierarchy is going to be one of competence and so if youre going to pursue value then youre going to construct a hierarchy and then theres an implication from that which is that if you construct a hierarchy most of the people within that hierarchical structure are a minority of people are going to be fantastically successful at the pursuit and a very large number are going to stack up at the bottom and thats a manifestation of whats whats known as prices law its mapped by the pre distribution its an expression of whats been known among economists as the Matthieu principle from the new testament to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing everything will be taken away and its an its an iron law of the distribution of success in hierarchies so if youre going to have value and youre going to have hierarchy then youre gonna have in equality and thats a problem now you cant so now now you have a political divide there so the conservative types say about we need two hierarchies and thats self-evident as far as Im concerned given that set of propositions because if you dont if youre gonna pursue something of value which you have to and need to then youre going to produce a hierarchy so if you demolish the hierarchies you demolish value itself and thats not a tenable a tenable move the left-wing though says and to their credit yeah but you have to be very careful with your hierarchies because they tend towards inequality of distribution thats one problem once theyre established they always also tend to a m of tyranny because once a hierarchy of competence has been established it can be invaded by people who use power as the means to attain status in the hierarchy and that can corrupt and destroy even the entire hierarchy so you have to be on guard  that plus if your hierarchy becomes too steep in its distribution so its too tiny a fraction of people at the top and too great an agglomeration of people at the bottom especially under conditions of genuine privation then the people at the bottom its not only unjust and unfair and producing excess suffering but the people at the bottom have nothing to lose and might as well just flip the hierarchy on its end and thats not a good way to produce a sustainable society you dont want to put people in the position where they have nothing to lose especially if you have something to lose but also just with regards to principles of like fairness and justice lets say so it seems to me that thats a decent way of conceptualizing the political landscape and that gives that gives you a conceptual framework within which you can put people on the left and right in their proper position the right basically is that portion of the population thats temperamentally that whos temperamental proclivity is to admire and support hierarchies and work effectively within them and thats actually the personality traits that make up a conservative because conservatives by temperament are low in trait openness which is a creativity dimension thats associated with lateral thinking its not I would say its its very environmentally underdetermined its its its a biological predisposition especially with regards to creativity and high in conscientiousness and the conservative temperamental types make very good managers and administrators thats how they manifest themselves in the world essentially if you set up a hierarchy and it runs on algorithmic it runs algorithmically then the Conservatives will do very well in that structure because they can implement an algorithm and theyre very good at implementing whereas the liberal pipes are very good at generating new hierarchies and so and thats and thats because theyre hired trade openness theyre less conscientious so theyre not suited as well to do within hierarchy operation but in a functioning economy and in a functioning democracy I would say you need both types you need the liberal types to establish new territory and to put out new values so that new hierarchies might be organized so that effective movement towards those ends might be instantiated and you need the Conservatives to actually implement the processes and so a society of only conservatives becomes static and thats not good because the environment transms and you have to keep up with it and a society thats only composed of the left-leaning liberal types is very good at generating all sorts of new possibilities but very bad at generating all sorts of new actualities and so we should be first of all cognizant of the fact that hierarchical organization is inescapable if youre also going to pursue value second that if you produce hierarchical structures that youre going to produce inequality inevitably and there are negative consequences as a as a function of that and that the and that both sides of that equation lets say need need a voice because both of those functions are are valuable necessary but also at odds with one another and at permanent odds because it is the case that you need hierarchies because otherwise you have nothing to do and its also the case that if you have hierarchies then the poor will always be with you and thats a thats a thats a chronic functional problem that has to be addressed and thats the proper place I would say of the left so thats only 1 minutes so but Im actually Im gonna stop there I think and you can you can chew on those propositions to see what you think of those but Im really interested actually and having a discussion with all of you and would be happy to start the question period a little earlier than might otherwise be necessary all right so thank you thank you very much please so now well move on to some questions Ill ask two initial questions and then open up to the audience in order to ensure that as many people as possible have a chance of asking questions so my first question is political correctness is a rather vague term that refers to a wide range of issues from preventing explicitly racist hate speech to calling out someone  wearing culturally insensitive clothes do you think that we should universally reject political correctness or is there a line that can be drawn well that was the other thing I was thinking about talking about tonight and and Im actually having a debate in Canada about that very proposition tomorrow so heres what Ive been thinking about that and trying to mulate my thoughts  my six minute initial opening remarks tomorrow is a very tight tight time constraint so think about it this way imagine that you need to describe the world in two in order to perceive the world and to act in at both of those not just to act in it but also to perceive it and that you need a description at different levels of resolution know when you can think about how you use your computer when youre when youre dealing with images you know there are some times when what you really need is a thumbnail these doesnt require much processing power and its sufficiently representative of the reality so that you can do whatever you need to do with the image with the thumbnail and you never replace the thumbnail with a high-resolution image if if the thumbnail will do I really like that I dont think its an analogy I actually think its a description of a very large number of cognitive operations and maybe theres a rule of thumb which is never use a high-resolution theory when a low-resolution theory will do the converse is also true by the way so then lets say that in order to orient ourselves properly in society we need a general-purpose low resolution ory existential theory something like that its not precisely a description of the objective world its more like an agreed upon and its an agreed upon narrative about how the world is constructed in relationship to human experience and how we should act in the world so how we should look at ourselves how we should look at history how we should look at our social being so that we can coexist peacefully so that we can move ward so that our societies function and then imagine that that comes in broadly two ms and I think it does one is a collectivist m and I would say that thats that collectivist m is built very deeply into human nature its essentially a tribal outlook its an outlook that you can trace back hundreds of thousands of years and perhaps more deeply than that we know  example that chimpanzees have a tribal outlook and that chimpanzees will patrol the borders of their tribes looking  chimpanzees who arent of the tribe and when they find them they will tear them into pieces and so that was that was revealed by Jane Goodall in the 1970s it was very shocking to everyone when that was when that was first discovered because there was a very influential line of thinking mostly derived from people who were influenced by Rousseau that you know human beings were innately good and that only culture made them cruel and incapable of atrocity but the fact that the chimpanzees patrolled their borders and tear apart their enemies really did that theory and in a very serious way so at least at least made it more complicated so so the collectivist view is essentially that the best way to conceptualize what a human being is is to look at what tribe they belong to and the tribe might be well this is one of the problems with the collectivist view is which of your tribal allegiances is to be paramount and thats actually a fatal problem by the way because theres an infinite number of ways you can be categorized and it isnt obvious which of those tribal allegiances should be canonical and hence the rise of intersectionality which is something thats thats a dragon that will eat its own tail certainly but theres a notion there its like the most important thing about get about that  a minute well say well the most important about thing about you is your group your gender your sex your race your ethnicity all of the multiple categories that were supposed to be considering as fundamental realities now and that the best way to construe reality is that its a battleground between those groups  dominance power and thats the postmodern ethos and its a pretty decent thumbnail sketch of reality you can sum it up quite quickly you can use it as a guide to action in all sorts of domains it has its consequences however and one of the consequences is that its tribal and tribal identities tend towards mayhem now the alternative low-resolution view is the view that I think has been articulated most effectively in the West and perhaps of all the places where its been most effectively articulated in the West the most effective articulation has come from the UK I mean theres something remarkable about what what your country has done with regards to laying out the idea of individual sovereignty in a fully articulated manner in a way that allows a political system to arise predicated on the assumption that the individual is of intrinsic value and if you need a thumbnail view of the world the most effective thumbnail view of the world isnt that youre the member of a tribe even though in many ways you are and the member of many tribes the most effective thumbnail view is that youre to be regarded as a sovereign individual and youre to treat other people that way as well both with regards to their rights but even more importantly and often gotten with regards to their responsibilities and I think that qualities that are based on the first set of presuppositions to tribal degenerate into precisely what youd expect which is tribal warfare and the second have the possibility of blooming into exactly what they have bloomed into which are the most functional societies the most peaceful societies the most successful societies the societies that are the best at generating wealth along with inequality that the world has ever seen and so I would say we sacrifice the latter to the mer at our great peril and I would also say that and this is something that Im very ashamed of is that the universities broadly speaking are doing absolutely everything they can as fast as they possibly can to ensure that we sacrifice the sovereign individual view  the collective tribal view and I think that is appalling beyond giveness and so thats what I think about political correctness all right thank you thank you as a follow-up question so your conception of truth as you said its tailored to what helps us survive and live doesnt that also mean that your approach to the meaning of truth is very similar to one of a postmodernist which are a group of people you so clearly denounce thats a good question its wrong but but its a good question well look you always have to give the devil is due and the there is a central postmodern claim which arises from a very complex conundrum and the conundrum is one that emerged in domains outside of the humanities lets say although a domain it emerged in the domain of literary criticism because what happened in the mid sixties was that a very large number of disciplines simultaneously realized that it was actually technically impossible to perceive the world because there was an infinite number of ways that you could perceive the world and so that bedeviled artificial intelligence I mean people thought  a long time that it would be easy to build machines that could see the world because there was the world and there were the objects and figuring out what the objects were wasnt hard it was maneuvering in the world that was hard but that turned out to be wrong its really really hard to figure out what the objects are and we actually dont know how we do it now you know 0 years later we have machines that can orient themselves pretty decently in the world but they had really had to be built in embodied m and I wont pursue that at the same time psychologists are working on perception ran into exactly the same conundrum because they figured out that they couldnt figure out how we could see things and and were still sorting that out and the literary critics figured out that there was no obvious canonical interpretation  a piece of literature and that raised a specter which was well if theres no obvious canonical interpretation how do you know that when interpretation is better than the other so out of that arose the postmodern notion that theres no grand narrative theres no justifiable grand narrative theres an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world and theres no grand narrative fair enough but well that raises the problem of value like if theres no grant narrative how do you orient yourself in the world and the postmodern answer to that was well lets get the complexity of that problem and sneaked our closet Marxism back into the game and that was into completely intellectually I mean Ive been accused of failing to notice that theres a contradiction between post-modernism and Marxism its like its not like I failed to notice that its obvious that theres a contradiction but its equally obvious that the post modernists broadly speaking is a thumbnail sketch because they cant solve the problem of how to orient yourself in the world if theres an infinite number of interpretations rely in a completely incomprehensible and paradoxical manner on the dictates of like a defunct 19th century philosophy to provide them with motive ce in the world so and thats a non tenable solution apart from being too dangerous beyond belief as the 20th century bares sufficient evidence to so now whether with regards to my conception of truth and whether its postmodern its like no actually its not so and its its very cool its a very complicated thing to sort out because there is more than one way of conceptualizing truth theres truth as its manifested in ethics and theres truth as its manifested in the description lets say of the objective material world and how those two things touch is not something weve weve sorted out well in the in the ethical world whats happened is that a an ethic has evolved over time I would say and that ethic is reflected in the central axioms of civilized human behavior but you can also see deep echoes of it in animal behavior and and it seems to arise out of the fact that the the interactions that take place among paired entities that have to interact repeatedly across time follow a set pattern so one of the things that Jacque panksepp discovered  example was that if you paired rats together to engage in rough-and-tumble play bouts which you might not think is particularly relevant but actually happens to be dead relevant because thats a special circuitry and its part of the circuitry upon which human ethics are based in if you pair them together first and one rat is bigger than the other then the big rat wins and so you think well play is dominated by power and thats how it and rats and its a power issue but if you pair them together repeatedly which is much more naturalistic experiment what you find is that once the large rat dominates the small rat the small rat has to ask the large rat to play and if the large rat doesnt let the small rat win 30% of the time and repeated play boats then the small rat wont play anymore and you think well so what its like no no no no not so what thats a major discovery thats like Nobel prize-winning material because what banks have demonstrated there was that theres an ethic of fair play emerges even among rats all you have to do is pair them together and there are there are rules that govern iterated ethical interactions that are emergent properties and those emergent properties are manifested as far as I can tell described in the great mythological stories that we tell in the in the great narratives that underlie our culture and theyre not based on arbitrary assumptions theyre based on observations of what furthered survival and reproduction to speak in a purely Darwinian manner over massive spans of time and so and to point to truth as construed in a Darwinian realm and to use the example of say iterated games to buttress that point is by no means similar in any way to participating in the same process that the deconstructionist participant artistic in so I would say well on the on the side of the postmodernist but not only the postmodernist there are an indefinite number of ways of construing the world that thats thats thats being demonstrated technically I dont think theres any debate about that but theres a very constrained number of ways that you can operate successfully in the world a very constrained number of ways and its not its not one way precisely because it has its its its scope of variation say across culture and across environments but its very tightly constrained now whats happened across the course of recorded history lets say is that that ethic this is something Nietzsche observed when he was critiquing the history of Western philosophy is that ethic manifested itself first at the level of behavior we acted out we dont understand just like a chimpanzee troupe acts out the ethic of their of their hierarchy they cant represent it they cant articulate it the structure emerges the structure and the behaviors that are associated with the structure emerge bee that is represented and certainly bee its articulated so first of all the ethic that governs repeated interactions at different scales of social interaction the structure emerges first and then its mapped and its first mapped an image and story and then its articulated and I would say well I talked earlier about the the role that England has played that the UK has played in articulating the political doctrine of the sovereign individual but the idea of the sovereign individual is far or older than those political articulations and its based in a narrative structure that is in turn based on the observation of behavioural patterns that have emerged reliably across time and so and thats not postmodern in the least its its its very straightward claim that there is something that approximates a universal human ethic thats built deep deeply into our biological and social structures and that was constructed in no small part as a consequence of Darwinian mechanisms so thank you so now were going to open up to the audience if you have a question please raise your hand wait  the microphone to reach you and stand up please make sure you only ask one question so  the first question we will go to the hand about the third row to the right yep wearing glasses professor Peterson in your 12 rules  life you speak very fondly of the influence of Alexander Solzhenitsyn during your mative years as a student and he also used several examples from the novels of further Dostoevsky to the straight certain points about psychology so I was just wondering is there any other way that Russian culture history has left a mark on your ideas well they arent the only Russian thinkers who influenced me I read a lot of Tolstoy including the kingdom of God is within you Bulgakov whose Master and Margarita is I dont even know what to say about that book Ive read it three times and I think I could read it another ten times its an its amazing its an amazing its an amazing tour de ce I certainly dont understand it its like a complex dream Ive collected Russian Soviet art era art  a long time I got very interested in constructivist art and Suprema to start and that there was a flowering of artistic productivity in the early stages of the Soviet revolution which was pretty much clamped down on immediately by Stalin in the 1930s and so I have a real affinity  Russian thought that I dont I dont understand so so those are some of the additional influences yeah thank you very much thank you on to the next question we will go to the lady to my right thank you so much  coming to speak to us Im a really big fan of yours and Ive especially appreciated all that youve written and spoken about regarding meaning as a an antidote  chaos and nihilism and Ill preface this by saying maps  meaning is on my summer reading list so if youve already answered this question in that book please let me know but Im wondering what you would say about what is the whats the source of meaning if it seems that lots of religions have answered that question with God but if there is no God then it seems that humans would have to kind of artificially impose meaning on the world in which case all of the meaning that we reap from the world is already given to it by us and theres no net meaning in the world or something like that so Im wondering what you would say about where a meaning comes from hmm thats a really good question I mean so when Nietzsche announced the death of God which was a something he announced actually in sorrow and trembling I would say rather than triumphantly which is often how thats read because people actually dont read Nietzsche they just read one half of a quote from Nietzsche his his his prognostication was that we would have to become creators of our own values and then it wasnt long after that that he died and so what that meant was that any further investigations into that idea by him came to an end now not much later Freud came along and throw demonstrated quite clearly even though he doesnt get nearly as much credit  this as he should that there was no evidence whatsoever that were people were masters of their own houses and that we were the playthings of the gods in the Greek sense that we were driven perceptually and behaviorally emotionally motivationally by ces that werent exactly under our voluntary control autonomous internal ces and you could think about those as where the gods went when they depopulated the cosmos and that was yost notion right and Jung was a very astute student of Nietzsche he gave a seminar on the first half of Nietzsches thus spake Zarathustra thats sixteen hundred pages long and so thats an in and its its actually quite a dance read as well so its not sixteen hundred pages written in crayon you know so an young sense was that Nietzsches prognostication had to be wrong because human beings cannot create their own values we actually dont have that capacity we might be able to participate in the creation of those values but we have to come to terms with our own nature while were doing so and I think the biological evidence  that is its absolutely overwhelming if you dont if you dont believe that then what that means is that either you dont know anything about biology or that youve stuck your head in the sand to the point where youre unable to see now Young was very interested in how that those internal ces manifested themselves but also how they organized themselves across time okay so theres two answers to your question one is that they organize themselves into a hierarchy and theres something at the top and what he believed that what was at the talk in the West was symbolized by the figure of Christ and he thought of Christ as a symbol of the self and the self was an emergent consequence of the internal arranging of motivational States into a hierarchy partly as a consequence of of psychological activity integration maturation but also partly as a consequence of social pressure because how you organize yourself is partly a consequence of who you are and how you organize yourself but its also partly a consequence of how other people demand that you be organized and so and I think that Jean Piaget --zz work fits very nicely into that I think that they were aiming in some sense at the same synthesis all right so with regards to so one one one one place  the derivation of meaning is the consequence of that hierarchical organization of those intrinsic motivational States into something approximating a unity that can operate properly across spans of time so the second answer to that is meaning is actually a manifestation of a very deep instinct and its an elaboration of something the Russian neuropsychologists thats another answer to the question about the Russians I was a devotee of the Russian neuropsychologists Alexander Luria and his students Sokolov in vineger dovè who were arguably the three greatest neuropsychologist of the last half of the 20th century and vinegared ovah and Sokolov discovered the orienting reflex which was probably the biggest discovery in psychophysiology in the last 0 years of the 20th century its a none léa important discovery and the orienting reflex is the reflex that Orients you towards what you dont understand its the reflex that Orients you towards anomaly and what that means is that you have a structure built into you to help you make sense of what you dont understand its an actual instinct now when the orienting reflex grips you thats when youre surprised by something or startled by something thats the lowest level manifestation of the orienting reflex and its actually part of the mechanisms that defend you against predators but that orienting reflex is and thats very low level nervous system responds very very quick very reflexive requires very little cognitive processing fast enough to have you jump out of the way of a striking snake so extraordinarily quick and dirty but like many important evolutionary adaptations its echoed at multiple levels of the nervous system and so the orienting reflex is actually very complex as it unfolds across time and so if something startles you you might spend a year thinking about it depending on how startled you were and that entire year-long process of thinking is actually an extended manifestation of the orienting reflex and thats a deep source of meaning and so so thats like a second answer the question and a third answer to the question would be something like your hemispheres are specialized in a particular way its a low resolution representation by the way so and and and so one of your hemispheres is specialized to operate when you know whats going on and where what youre doing is having the results you intend you can think about that is explored territory thats the left hemisphere in most people the right hemisphere is the hemisphere where the orienting reflex first manifests itself and its job is to orient you where you dont know where are things that you dont know are happening so its also the place where imagination first takes root because imagination is part of the process by which you make sense out of what you dont understand thats where the hypotheses are generated the right hemisphere tends to think in metaphor and the left hemisphere is embedded in the metaphorical structure of the right hemisphere and thats quite well documented in the relevant neuropsychological literature from from a multitude of sources even from people who arent concerned specifically with metaphor the sense of meaning seems to manifest itself when the the the the systems that are operating in explored territory and the systems that are operating in unexplored territory are operating optimally together so imagine that what you want to do to to adapt property to properly to life is to stay where youre adapted okay so thats a conservative approach dont go where you dont know how to act the problem with that is that things around you will change without your without your control so you you cant just stay where you are you have to be prepared  the next thing thats coming and so not only do you have to master where you are you have to master whats most likely to happen next and so you have to have one foot in chaos or in order and you have to have one foot in chaos and the way you know that thats happening optimally is that youre imbued with a sense of meaning right so its actually the most profound part of what actually Orients you in the real world its not a secondary at the phenomena and that in the phenomenologist the the philosophical phenomenal just actually caught on to this in the phenomenological in their in their phenomenological work  someone like Heidegger  example meaning was the most real manifestation and I actually think thats true neurophysiological II thats how your brain operates your brain actually operates as if the most real thing is the meaning of something and the meaning is related and the really the thing about the reason  that is tied back to the Darwinian idea is that youre not a describer of the world not fundamentally youre trying to live in the world youre trying to survive in the world and propagate in the world like you have a Telos and the meaning is associated with that Tilos within that Darwinian landscape and then you say well is it real its like it depends on what you mean by real right and and you know people say well yeah thats a postmodern answer its like no its not its not at all its because there is a conflict between the materialist view thats laid out in the Newtonian sense and the evolutionary viewpoint thats laid out in the door Willian sense and the meaning relates to whats real in the Darwinian sense not in a Newtonian sense but that doesnt mean that its not real well it depends it depends on how you sort out your initial axioms but if youre interested in surviving and not being too miserable while youre doing so then I would suggest that you at least give some credence to the Darwinian position so thats meaning all right so  the next question we will go to the hand just that yeah dont get those poor people up there yeah Ill take a couple question upstairs well thank you very much  your talk dr. Pierce and I say that a Cobras was a great break but my vision as I said earlier you talk that conservatives people who temperamentally conservative always seek to preserve the hierarchy and in a kind of a healthy society and people who are temporary the liberal will always question those hierarchies is it inevitable inevitable insight inevitable then and we will slowly move in a liberal direction and there eventually those people who are liberally minded will question the very foundations of meaning and we will be in a situation where conservatives who want to budge because theres a fundamental hierarchy and liberals didnt want to stop because its a logical progression of where they have been going well its thats an eternal danger like this dangers on both sides one is the danger of pathological order and the other is the danger of pathological chaos and the problem with the questioning tendency is that it knows no limits and thats actually hard on people like well its very its actually very difficult orienting yourself in life if you happen to be very high in openness very low in conscientiousness and very high in neuroticism because you question everything and youre not stable and you might be wildly creative like thats a pretty good recipe  wild creativity but that doesnt mean that its tenable or sustainable because most creative ideas are not only wrong theyre theyre actually deadly but some of them arent some of them are absolutely vitally important right and so part of the reason we have political discussion or discussion at all is to separate the wheat from the chaff so the endless proclivity of the questioning tendency of the liberal left is that every axiom is open  infinite questioning well that leaves you bereft but the problem on the right is if you tighten things up too much well then you have no adaptive flexibility left and youre in a sterile tyranny a tyranny of stone and then the environment shifts around you and youre not prepared and then everyones done so the reason that free speech is so important as far as Im concerned because why dont you really think about it as free speech I think about it as what respect  the manifestation of the logos its something like that thats the proper way of conceptualizing it is that it keeps the balance between those two tendencies right because you you need the questioning and you need the order and so you think well how much of each and the answer is the recipe changes day to day and so you think well if it changes day to day how are we going to keep up and the answer is by keeping up right here we are were alive right we we can keep up but we do that by thinking and we think by talking and we we think and talk by disagreeing and and we better disagree conceptually because then we dont have to act out stupid ideas that will kill us right because its so so really the abstract the abstract territory of conceptual dispute is the substitute  war and death and it can be a brutal substitute because conceptual disagreement can be very intense but compared to war and death its hardly intense at all and so you keep the that you keep the landscape open  serious dispute including dispute thats offensive obviously because if youre ever going to talk about anything thats difficult and why talk otherwise then youre going to talk about things that are offensive to people and youre gonna do it badly youre gonna stumble around when youre mulating your thoughts and thats horrible it makes people anxious it alienates them but its better than pain and death and thats the alternative so thank you well take a question from upstairs please project your voice as there will be no microphone to the lady in the block [] well it would be if I was trying to reduce all the individual variability to that but to note that people vary across the dimension is not necessarily simultaneously to limit all the variability to those dimensions theres lots of other variability and your question to some degree is whether the act of categorization is in itself a limitation on individual freedom I think if you push your question all the way down to the bottom and the answer to that is to some degree yes but its also a precondition  individual freedom so is that sufficient I dont all right I would say that I perhaps Im doing that but I dont see how thats the same as what the post modernists are doing I mean as far as I can tell the post modernists arent saying that the groups the individuals within those groups are characterized by any stable characteristics whatsoever except  the fact of their comparative oppression like so I dont understand the first part of your argument I mean part of the reason that postmodern types have been going after me is because I Ive dared to say that men and women differ in temperament which by the way they do [] that thats actually something that might be worth just dip differentiating quickly because its actually technically somewhat challenging but also very much worth knowing I was debating someone on a panel this morning on a TV show the right stuff and this is a woman who led the female the womens equality party and she cited some psychological literature that purported to claim that men and women were mostly the same and thats actually true we are more the same than different if you look at our temperaments theres more overlap than there is variance by a substantial amount and so even on the temperamental dimensions where there is most difference between men and women the difference isnt of massive magnitude at the center of the distribution so  example women are less aggressive than men which is by the way why they commit suicide to commit suicide more often but are much less lethal in their actions thats one example but there are many examples if you draw a random woman and a random man out of the population the probability that the man will be more aggressive is 60% if you bet on the man youd win 60% of the time thats not a walloping difference its not 9 percent of the time you know its its a difference that is substantive its significant its measurable but its not large by the standards by which such things are judged but thats not the point the point is is that most of the activity takes place at the extremes so out on the tails of the distribution so heres an example about 9 out of 10 people in prison are male why because to be in prison you have to be the most aggressive person lets say in a hundred ok those differences at the midpoint are large enough so that if you go out to the extremes one in a hundred people you have an overwhelming preponderance of men and so you can have your cake and eat it too you can say well yeah broadly speaking men and women are more the same than different the overlap is greater than the disjunction but that not relevant if whats being selected is often at the extremes and it often is so  example with regards to engineering theres a fair bit of evidence that people who are more interested in things than in people become engineers now thats not really gonna be what is that shocking are you shocked by that you shouldnt be shocked by that right you can you can tell that not only by what engineers do but you can tell that by how they think and you can tell that just by talking to them if you know a bunch of Engineers so and it turns out that the largest temperamental difference thats known between men and women is actually interested in people versus interest in things and so it has nothing to do with competence but it has a lot to do with interest and because you have to be very interested in things to go be an engineer because thats all youre gonna be doing if youre an engineer then only those people who are extremely interested in things tend to become engineers and most of them are men and thats why even in places like Scandinavia where a tremendous amount of eft has been put into flattening the socio-cultural landscape and successfully by the way theres still a preponderance of male engineers and theres a preponderance of female nurses and no matter how much sociological gerrymandering goes along goes on those statistics have remained quite intractable over about a 1 year period and so there are differences there are differences theyre not massive and then you might ask well are those socio-cultural or biological its like well thats a hard question to answer because it depends on how much variability there is in this socio-cultural landscape because the proportion by which something is biological versus socio-cultural varies with the socio-cultural landscape thats a complicated thing to to to digest because you think of those things is fixed but theyre not so but what we have demonstrated quite clearly and this is mainstream science despite the fact that people dont like it but this test has already been done so we developed a personality model thats pretty stable across cultures purely derived from statistical from statistical processes and a theoretical model if there was one and quite an unattractive model because of that conceptually but thats beside the point then we saw a cross culturally whether there were differences in that fundamental temperaments of men and women in the answer was yes cross culturally quite robust women are higher in the experience of anxiety and emotional pain and theyre more compassionate and agreeable those are the big differences and theyre their differences of a magnitude that I already pointed out then the next question is well to what degree is that biological versus socio-cultural and its complicated because that very variable depends on the socio-cultural landscape but well put that aside you can determine that by stacking up countries from those who have done everything they possibly can to flatten out the socio-cultural landscape in relationship to gender to those who havent that are still very stratified by sex and then what you do is you look at the magnitude of the temperament differences in keeping with the variability that those countries have in terms of their socio-cultural egalitarianism and the socio-cultural types the the social constructionist their prediction is as cultures become more egalitarian men and women become more different more the same sorry more the same because its environmental that isnt what happens exactly the opposite happens as you flatten out the socio-cultural landscape men and women become more different the data is in the experiment is done tens of thousands of people multiple countries and its not what anyone expected and you might think well its all the right-wing psychologists its like all the right-wing psychologists are in this room sitting in this chair thank you answer the next question the gentleman in glasses I just want to first thank you comments on things like political correctness and the obsession of certain elements of the lift on campuses to screen out discourse because I genuinely think that is an issue and problem stance quo but following on from there I just want to pick your thoughts and what you say about freedom of speech and discussions in general right because you basically flagged I think in your answers just then that freedom of speech has an instrumental purpose its there to help us find truth correct me wrong to to identify the correctness or the logos against the possible consequence of blood and death so heres the question if I as an individual am affected by discourse in a way that doesnt cause physical violence so you thats not bind by hate speech laws and whatnot but makes me feel so deeply uncomtable they dont belong to society or this community or when I say something whatever and whenever I try to say something Im really cute because of our race the way I talk about jinda or where behave then surely that means that my valuable insight to contribute towards locals towards the pursuit of truth it shut out by other peoples more vociferous speech and more dominant speech and this is what we see in cases of campuses whether it be from the right or the left of people using very violent and loud language to drown out dissent to drown out those who oppose them on campuses in society and what not from Donald Trump to people in Swarthmore weve seen this happen so wouldnt you say that the attempt to clawback or the right of freedom of speech isnt so far absolute as instrumental and based on that theree there are some cases where freedom of speech of some individuals can be curtailed if we want to get the better appreciation of the logos and a better inclusion of more voices theyre currently being shut out as a result of the extremity and radicalism of those selects  you wouldnt you say thats the case thank you theres a very simple answer to that which is yes but Ill elaborate I mean the first thing is like Im not an admirer of hate speech laws but that doesnt mean that Im naive enough to think that theres no such thing as hate speech so obviously if youve ever been involved in an extremely serious argument you know perfectly well theres such a thing as hate speech because youve probably uttered some so you know so and and theres theres also no doubt that there are ms of speech that are utterly reprehensible and some of those are actually already punished by law you cant incite to violence you cant libel someone right so so we have some restrictions already on whats acceptable discourse whether its the case typically speaking that some people have more privileged access to free speech than others well thats obviously the case thats part of thats part of power and power is one of the means by which people climb hierarchies although the more you can climb a hierarchy by exercising power the more thats an indication of the fact that that hierarchy has become corrupt so theres no doubt that these structural impediments to the free exchange of discourse exist theres also no doubt as you already laid out that thats not in everyones best interest because what you want if you have any sense in your society and this is also why I think that weve put proper emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual is that you want everyones logos to have the opportunity to clarify the unknown and reconstitute the world and if you shut that down then you risk getting access to the unique insights that that individual might bring ok so I agree with your diagnosis completely and and I and I think that you know even even in the West to ignore the fact that many of our hierarchies tilt towards tyranny and that prejudice still exists in multiple ms is a mistake although its only one factor among many and shouldnt be identified as the as the primary causal determinant of each individuals life I think thats thats a dreadful error the question is what do you do about it and the Devils in the details and as I said already Im not an admirer  example of hate speech laws even though theres plenty of hateful speech because I think the best thing to do is to leave free speech alone as much as you possibly can not because that will result in the perfect conditions  free speech but because anything else that youre likely to do is going to make it worse rather than better and so thats how it looks to me very quickly so I just want to pick your brains on hate speech laws because it seems that you agreed on a pursuit of logos and logic and some sort of achievement of individualization individual autonomy that is is the end goal of discussion here right so lets assume but correct me if Im wrong again arts the end objective heres the thing it seems I wouldnt say that exactly I wouldnt I wouldnt say that exactly I think thats I think thats too individualistic I would say that what you want is two things happening simultaneously is that you want to maximize individual development but you want to do that in a way that brings them the greatest amount of harmony simultaneously possible to the familial unit and also to the broader social unit so those things those interests have to be stacked its like whats best  you but thats also in a manner thats best  your family and  your community so its not purely individual so so on that basis of achieving communal harmony and individual freedom at the same time what didnt you say that theres certain problems with phrases to be or hate speech theyre so vehement and so D dignifying that it disrupts both local harmony within communities but also makes individuals feel as if they cant really engage in retaliatory you know CloudFactory discourse against him because they fear the potential repercussions even if it doesnt lead to violence they just fear it so much so in my irrationally all rationally evens right so what happens happens all the time its in fact its the standard its the standard situation you know if you look across the world most societies dont do a good job of either promoting or allowing free speech its a I dont know how we ever managed it its so unlikely because its so its so hard on people and Im hard on those who occupy positions of power in tyrannical hierarchies that I cant I cant believe that any societies ever managed to figure it out at all so those dangers are always there and and and I also think the the highest likelihood often is that societies that do put high value on free speech will lose that because its so difficult to maintain so but with regards to hate speech  example lets say that things would be much better if there was less hateful speech its like seems highly probable to me especially if you look at the more egregious ms of hateful speech how best to regulate it well my sense is is you let those who wish to utter hateful things do so and let everyone hear them because thats the best way to ensure that what theyre saying will be understood and rejected now in order to posit that you have to assume that the population composed of sovereign individuals is wiser than it is foolish and you know thats thats thats a type that thats a hope you might think about it as an axiom of faith but I do believe it to be the case I think that if you if you put the evidence in front of people by and large they will do the right thing I think that if you if you the problem with regulating hate speech its very simple who defines hate and the answer to that is over any reasonable period of time exactly the people you would least want to have define hate and so the consequences of the regulation become incalculably worse as a problem then the problem that they were designed to deal with to think otherwise is to think in a sort of utopian manner its like well we have a problem hate speech well we can come up with a solution and there will be no problems with that solution its like no no no that isnt how the world works you know when Im negotiating with my clinical clients one of the things I always tell them is often because theyre in difficult circumstances and often not  psychological reasons its like no you dont understand youre screwed both ways you dont you dont have an option here where youre not going to suffer thats that thats what it means to be in a bad situation youre gonna pay a price both ways you can pick your price okay so were gonna have hate speech or were gonna have the consequences of the arbitrary regulation of hate speech well I know what the consequences are of the arbitrary regulation of hate speech is that things get a lot worse because hates very difficult to define and thats actually a real problem when youre trying to regulate it because you have to be able to define it and were already at a point where well you made someone uncomtable why isnt that hate speech I mean I was basically asked that by one of your by one of your most outstanding journalists or your most popular journalism but why should you have the right to say something thats so offensive its like everything we can think that true lets think that through  a minute so I mean my report to her essentially although this wasnt directly it was thats not a very smart question  a journalist to be asking right because of all people who should never ask that question will be stand-up comics right and journalists because thats all they ever do thats what it means to be a journalist is to ask a question thats going to be offensive to someone who the hell wants to hear about what youve discovered unless its about something contentious and important so it was it was a jaw-dropping question as far as I was concerned and the fact that it was a jaw-dropping question was part of the reason why that video went viral okay so now lets think about offensiveness as part of hate okay so the first thing we might say is that you really need to think when you have a difficult problem and a difficult problem is one where theres something at stake it might be your life it might be your well-being but its a its its and then we might say well theres gonna be a diversity of opinions about that particular conundrum if it actually happens to be difficult and so even to discuss it because if you discuss it youre gonna discuss option a its gonna Vannoy all the people who want option B or youre gonna discuss your option B and thats gonna annoy all the people that want option a and maybe theres ten options so if youre gonna discuss anything of any real significance whatsoever youre gonna make people hard under the collar and youre gonna risk offending them okay so why dont you just stop talking about difficult things the answer that is yes and thats whats happening but then theres another problem which is there isnt anything I could conceivably say about anything that isnt going to offend someone if the crowd is lured large enough so you might say well if youre talking to two people you cant offend one of them so you dont get to offend 0% of the population its like okay lets say Im talking to a thousand people and one person finds what Im saying offensive say well thats hateful its like well thats one in a thousand so should I stop what if its one in 10,000 or one in a million like wheres the cutoff and you might think well well work that out its like no no no no you dont get it the Devils in the details you work it out now when you mulate your restrictions on free speech you dont shunt that off into the future so that its a problem that will be solved who defines hate insoluble problem dont regulate it because you cant define it thats how it looks to me so you have the the free marketplace of ideas so to speak where the collective can render a judgment on the acceptability of an idea on an ongoing basis and that isnt a great solution because we dont have great solutions we have partial fragmentary solutions that make us somewhat less abject ly miserable than we might be thats what we have and if we try to if we try to eradicate that kind of risk completely all we do is magnify a different kind of risk thank you so we have time  one or two more questions so next question will go to the lady just here you took on a very high level  me I pray Thanh a kind of quite ordinary got a street level and the sort of thing that really annoys me about this whole thing is  instance I was listening to any questions Friday evening and there was the Republican you know person abroad in Scotland well the audience have decided that this man cant say anything that Im ever going to agree with so Im going to disagree with everything he says well I disagreed with him on some things I dont like fracking but I thought some of the other things he said were quite sensible but it seems to me most people suddenly get a prejudice about a person  instance even Donald Trump who Im not a mad fan about but one or two things he said I think quite you know not too stupid and so why cant people start talking about issues instead of sort of you know getting these sort of prejudices about people oh well you know if theyre if theyre on the so-called you know demonstration in London  the day of freedom oh they must be all fascists and right-wing and goodness knows what nobody actually listens to what theyre saying or what theyre doing theyve just made up their mind and then you get your tribal warfare and thats what were getting so much or well some of it some of its a technical problem like people dont like it when you ce them to think at high resolution and its no wonder because look lets say youre driving your automobile along and you think this is my car and I understand it and your evidence is that as you move the steering thingy it stays on the road mm-hmm thats your understanding of your car as soon as it breaks down its like you realize you dont understand your car at all not even a bit right and so you actually dont even perceive the car until it breaks down and then youre very unhappy that you have to perceive it because all it is is a whole nest of and you have no idea what to do with any of them and so people dont like having to think at a high resolution and so if someone says on a contentious issue well you know its complicated and we have to differentiate it like this then you have to go through all the god-awful process of realizing that you dont have the clue what youre talking about in that circumstance and you have to evaluate all those differentiated issues its way easier just to say well youre probably a neo-nazi and so I dont have to listen to you and and and its it well and so thats often what people do thats particularly the case if they have a low-resolution ideology that theyre trying to protect because that gives them every extra reason to do that kind of instantaneous labeling its a very bad strategy if youre dealing with an individual one on one you know so if youre in a long-term relationship with someone and they bring up their annoyance with something that you do a very bad response to them is that well I dont have to listen to you because youre a terrible person right your relationships are gonna collapse completely if you do that every time what you want to do is differentiate the argument to the point where a solution might be generated and have have the argument at that level but its very hard  people to do that so you end up with these radical oversimplifications that manifest themselves untunately in the political polarization that we see were not going to solve our problems unless we can be a little bit more open about you know issues rather than sort of you know immediately thinking of a prejudice to say about something great which is part of the reason why Im not a fan of political correctness because if we if we make the general diagnosis that the world is a landscaping landscape of competing power groups and and that the fundamental narrative is oppressor versus oppressed and that everything is to be viewed through that light then through that lens then we wont solve our problems we wont well just have a bunch of new horrible problems you see I mean Im much older than all these people and I tend to think oh students have these ideas oh that mans homophobic so Im not gonna listen to any other thing that he has to say you know Brendan ONeill came here  instance you know they they just think oh thats a wrong idea so you cant possibly have any right ideas that isnt gonna help is it right not really thank you we have time  one final question so  the final question well go to the second round I am Canadian and we have a leader who is probably the most attempting to be the most politically correct leader in the world Id love to hear your response if you have his ear  five minutes and could present very simply to him where he might be going wrong well I guess I would ask him to consider the possibility that his emphasis on tribal inequality might if theres any possibility that he can see any ways that that might do more harm than good because my sense is that the idea that harm might come out of that is never an idea thats even considered I certainly dont see that in our provincial government  example see I see that the the initial low resolution act of dividing people into their tribal groups in that manner as something that can do nothing but bear evil fruit in the long run and the people who do that thing know thats how were going to rectify historical inequities its useful if you have a theory to think through the worst possible consequences of its application right its a good antidote to ideological possession its like well just  a minute imagine that your theory could go spectacularly wrong what would that look like this is one of the things thats so great about the way the Americans set up their political system because it was never utopia their idea was look were probably going to be were probably going to be governed by half-wits who are not any smarter than we are it wasnt were going to set up the perfect system its like how can we ensure that if were governed by half-wits that are no smarter than us that we wont end up in hell right and hence the balance of powers and all of those things and so and so they were very sophisticated and as good Englishmen should because they were basically good Englishmen right and well they were they were they came out they absolutely were you know I mean Americas freedom is a manifestation of the deeper freedom of Great Britain anyone with any sense can see that so its just true historically I mean maybe the Americans codified it in a in a creative manner and good  them but the fundamental traditions were already laid down they had enough humility to think through how things could go terribly wrong even if they had good intentions thats the mark of someone whos wise because its way easier  things to go wrong than it is  them to go right and maybe its even more important that we are careful about how things dont go terribly wrong than we are to be too concerned with making sure that they go right because hell is a long ways down and we can only make things so much better so I guess thats what Id ask them lets just think it through were tribal izing or tribal izing our perceptions can you think of any ways that might not work out so well and then how would you mitigate against that the wise social Simon one of the reasons that Im a traditionalist lets say because Im not really temperamental II suited to be a conservative despite the fact that identified myself as the only extent right-wing psychologist that was a joke primarily is because one of the things that wise social scientists know and attempt to transmit to their students is the probability that youre well-meaning Intervention say it at a clinical level or an epidemiological level will have the positive outcome you intend and no other is zero in fact the highest probability is that it will kick back against you and make things worse so you bloody well better be sure when you implement your well intentioned intervention that you lay out a measurement strategy to determine what the consequences of that intervention are because theyre very unlikely to be an improvement thats especially the case if the system is already working well because if its already at 8 percent optimal capacity moving it up another five percent is really hard whereas making it work fifty percent worse its like any fool can manage that so when things are working be very cautious about what you do radically to fix them because you dont know what the consequence of your intervention is going to be and so thats another thing that I might suggest caution and to the degree that Im a conservative Im a conservative because because of my apprehension of my own ignorance its like first do no harm thats also why in my public lectures I counsel people lets say to put their own house in order its like youre not gonna hurt anyone by doing that right all its gonna do is make you a little less chaotic and horrible and then maybe youll be of a little more benefit to your family that might be a nice thing too and then maybe you could dare to you know extend the tentacle out beyond that and tap something in the real world gently well that isnt what were taught in universities were taught that well youre 18 and you can see whats wrong and you should think of some ways of radically transming the economic system right all right thank you Id like to remind everyone that theres a book sale going on in the Goodman library following this talk please remain seated until weve left the chamber and please join me in thanking dr. Peterson  joining you"
20,0,"[] [] I I think thats a louder cheer than Bernie Sanders got wooden whos here two weeks ago so so well done thanks thanks  coming along today my pleasure Ill ask a few questions and then hopefully youve got some entertaining and witty questions to ask as well so well get some from the audience too so I mentioned in my introduction that youre on tour at the moment and youve been spending a lot of time this year on it and thats after seven years from your previous stand-up tour what brought you back um well it I never went away its just that it kept getting pushed back and I think the difference was I always considered stand-up as my sort of second or third job and I thought myself as a writer director and and TV shows and films sort of came first you cant you cant put a tour and then change your mind because tickets have been sold so you have to know youre not doing something  a long time and I kept doing more things and went and when you do it all yourself if you write and direct it you know three hours of TV which is what I do  a series that takes me a year you know so the office extras Derek Idiot Abroad which all two series and a special is three years work and you cant really interrupt that so it was just that I just got second place but now I dont know why but um its number one on my list now I could I could give up TV and film to just do stand-up because I love it more than ever I dont know why I realized what a privilege it is it sort of the last bastion of self-censorship outside the novel you know what you say is what they hear theres no and interfering its a good time its a really good time  stand-up and I think that um I think Ive probably acquired old peoples rights Im at that age where I can say what I want like you nan used to you know so yeah Ive Im absolutely loving it more than I ever did so you just said now stand ups great because theres nobody interfering and youre an obviously renowned  speaking what you think youre probably one of the most controversial comics out there do you feel in the industry today theres a real movement to be more sensitive and hold back and being afraid of offending firstly if someone says youre controversial theyre only right by definition because theyve said it I you know I think um you know Darwin was controversial when he came up with it you know how do the species you know I think I think people lump you in with shock comedians who try and hurt peoples feelings or say things that theyre you know theyre like trolls and Im not Im always Im always sort of doing it  a reason I you know and Ive always said just cause youre offended doesnt mean youre right some people are offended by a quality so Im never trying to offend but in this new tour it is it is about freedom of speech an offense culture and and all that but Ive never considered myself I dont know I think I got that reputation from the Golden Globes maybe where I gently ribbed some of them richest most privileged beautiful people in the world and they can get but I mean if I can justify every joke I can justify and I think I think some people get offended when they mistake the subject of the joke with the actual target particularly when youre dealing with taboo subjects and I do deal with taboo subjects  a reason because I want to take the audience to that place they hadnt been bee you know I want that people know that a joke about a bad thing isnt the same as the bad thing its not even necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be aunty the bad thing it could be veiled in irony or satirical or whatever but I think I think people have to you know look look at what a joke is the real target is so Id only say Im controversial because I talk about controversial subjects I dont think that the content is its funny because comedians always get asked is there anything you wouldnt joke about but journalists dont get asked is there anything you wouldnt write about and all were doing is discussing a subject but very quickly and hopefully with a punchline so it just depends on the joke comedy comes from a good or a bad place so what looks like cruelty or you know controversy sometimes its its trumped-up so you know on the topic of things that journalists wouldnt wouldnt wouldnt write about and what comics would and wouldnt make fun about do you think people can effectively satirize a joke about whats going on in politics today look in the UK or the u.s. youve you know youve said a few things about the general election youve said a few things about Trump do you think thats something that people should make fun of or is it too station you can you know you can make fun of everything but youve got you you youve got um know that people have the right to be annoyed and offend didnt come back at you and make fun of you so its not its not whether youre allowed to its people want to find some sort of justification but morality isnt absolute and its in its relative and and an offense is subjective so you know affected about feeling so you know with particular Merak or its come down to sort of two tribes now that youre either with him or youre against him and then I try and keep politics out of comedy because I think comedy is an intellectual pursuit and as soon as you start relying on the audience agreeing with you youre suddenly rallying and I think it loses something comedic Lee you know on both sides you know Ive seen I wont name it what Ive seen it is a northern comic and he came out and he just said what are we gonna do about all these fucking immigrants and he got a round of  and I just thought thats not a joke thus well I wasnt offended by I was just offended that it wasnt a joke that was the offensive bit  me it was you know youve gotta hit that so it youve got to be careful with politics that youre not just youre not just spewing your side and and I think its very important as well in comedy if Im going to go after anything and the Im the butt of the joke sometimes you know and and thats fun  me that we in all my work whether its the office or or stand up Im usually satirizing ego and Prejudice and all those things and I often play the guy that gets it wrong fact when I started off I won a thing called the eleven oclock show was a satirical news show I played a sort of an out-of-touch sort of right-wing bigoted boor okay you know with with heavy satire people got it and this year Id already started writing this and because there was such a such an angry divide you know its just suddenly on Twitter half the people had Magga in there you know and the victory of the flag and her holding a gun and and the other half were crying and I just thought and now if I do that and I sort of come down on the wrong side ironically I dont want any anyone in the room  one second to think that Im actually like that because I didnt realize that people like that really did exist and were proud of it and its so funny now in the last couple of years that people think theyve won something like after brexit people were out with placards saying we won go home and I was thinking what did you win you had one vote and what did what did you what do you mean you won its such a scissor there is a strange shift in mentality theres a theres a theres a vitriol to politics its like theyre validated where they you know but I do I do try and keep out of okay comedy yeah and one thing youre good  and you you alluded to now is youre not afraid of dividing opinion youre not afraid of you know some people saying I disagree with you and some people say I agree with you is that the same thing thats become more the case as youve gone on your career and youve been more successful well again its the if if everyones agreeing with you youre in an echo chamber you youve just chosen youve just chosen your people to speak to so that I did a tweet the other the other week that just said this tweet is controversial and I did a poll and it came out fifty-fifty its you know controversy is just someone saying someone that someone else doesnt agree with but I dont know really um I Im never scared to talk about any subject but I I have to be confident that Ive got something to say and what I say is fair even if that as I say veiled in irony by being unfair or stupid or so its its its all a discussion its just its just a discussion really and I mean the important thing  me is that everyones everyone no one has to laugh I in fact I embrace the gasps as much as the laughs because that means they were listening you know I think its an offense is good offense makes people think it makes them think it makes them come up with another argument youve got to come up with an argument because Im just tired of people saying Im offended I want to say it so what that just means youre just telling me your feelings Ive got a pain in my knee what do we do about it now Im on the topic of your Twitter as looking on your Twitter page earlier I think youve got um you know over 12 12 and a half million followers spit better than the unions I think poultry 27,000 that were on at the moment but um and through your Twitter page you talk about animal rights you talk about other issues that are important to you is that an effective medium  change is that how it is actually I know it is I mean just practically speaking years ago it would take you months and maybe years to get a hundred thousand signatures standing outside Tescos you know  a petition and thats the magic number because thats when it gets heard in Parliament and voted on and Ive been part of five six different campaigns that have got that far so it is good it does its good to mobilize people because um theres a lot of people dont let a lot of people browse it I mean a lot of its nonsense you know a lot of idiots on Twitter but theres a lot of idiots on the high street youve still got to go there you know so and I and my new show I do blame Twitter  the beginning of the demise of somewhat tongue-in-cheek of humanity I say Ive lived through the best 0 years a humanity you know and now its going the other way but and Twitter was the one that sort of started popularity being more important than being right you know and people have picked up symptoms of that in all walks of life because its all about likes retweets blocked someone doesnt agree with you so you get you create your own echo chamber same as Facebook and and also started this this ridiculous myth you know we in my opinion is worth as much as your opinion now people say things like my opinion is worth as much as your facts I think was just not true its just you know so that is a worry that is a worry in this post true theory that the more you say a lie you know the more people will take it as the truth it doesnt make it true so what do you think should happen I mean you cant ban stupid people out there are wrong people from talking know you know your course you cant and I quote I like stupid people because they make me seem clever they they bring the average down so far that they put me in like the top few percent so I wouldnt have a thing said against I mean stupidity ignorance is is the biggest danger to you money you know it really is I mean thats a very broad thing to say and but um I mean there are some incredibly stupid people in the world but as I say Im a big fan Im a big Im a big fan of their numbers in their what they do to the average so Im staying on this talk about the topic of social media youve just said its a great opportunity to organize people get people together and probably one good byproduct of your fame is that youre able to promote causes that you care about yeah is that something you feel all celebrities to occupy that sort of following should do no I do I do I know I I never expect anyone to care as much as I do about anything and that and I dont expect then to be surprised when I dont care about their thing you know everyone everyones everyones different Ive always done this people say you know Ive always cared about animal court you just you know I suppose I had less of an audience when I was 20 or 2 no Id do it because I cant I cant bear it I you know I I dont know why I you know its always its always made its the one thing thats always sort of made my blood boil and even to the point of depression that you know that I just dont get animal cruelty I dont get it I dont get any cruelty but at least people can speak so no its just a you know they said how Ive always been Ive always Ive always loved nature and animals Ive always fight was a privilege to have a wild animal you know or domestic but I just think its a when Im at home weve got a rule that the cat is asleep on our lap the other one has to get the drinks we cant disturb it I just dont want to disturb this is so lovely and peaceful and yeah and I do I do I suppose are probably over emotional over over animals so we personify them and but yeah but Ive always Ive always felt the way I probably I probably care more about the individual quality of an animal than animal husbandry or or or wildlife conservation in a way I just think if theres last two leopards dont put them in a cage and try and save the species let them go and okay thats the species gone but you know I worry about the the rights of the individual animal great well um so moving on to a different topic I mentioned in my introduction you know the office is being remade I think six or seven times now we met year local Remax yeah I think the last one just happened its not out yet I think its a finished version but the you know when you first came up with the script and the idea that was over you know 1 years ago do you think its a show that would be commissioned today do you think humors in the same place would be commissioned then if if I had made my own little demo of it because if you think about it it doesnt jump off the page you know middle-aged man says a joke that no one laughs at looks at the camera touch his tie its I think I think comedies you know to be permed you know so I had to show them what I meant and it way and it was a it was a slightly different show because it was about it was about because it was steeped in realism it was a fake documentary so I had to be real so did the the dialogue so did the you know characterization and the way we speak was a lot of its nonverbal we stopped halfway through a sense we go um um we use our hands we we look around we dont look at the person we look at our feet when were lying so it had to be seen because on the page you couldnt tell what sort of person David Brent was its how he acts and why he acts you know he if that had been a straightward sitcom that wasnt effect documentary its been nothing but when you realize hes showing off because he thinks hes going to be discovered well it brings it to life now hes a now hes a man baby narcissist but but an early prototype not nothing nothing on Trump you know hes hes he put David Brent to shame so that and thats what the the movie life on the road its all looked into is how the worlds changed in those 1 years and you know hes an early sort of reality star and by todays standards hes hes hasnt got the power nowadays because its since then weve had things like  Apprentice where people get on it by saying I would destroy anyone who stands in my way and people go in Big Brother and they they promise that theyre theyre behaved badly and I just think theres this its an odd thing now that theres no difference between Fame and infamy people do bad things to be famous and they get rewarded  it theres people that do nothing to be famous they just they just live their life like an open wound and theyre rewarded  it I mean a think thats reward you know and people some people use it as therapy how often have you seen like a a celebrity whos fallen from grace often through no fault of their own but they go into Celebrity Big Brother and they say I want to show the public a different side of me Im thinking why do you care they want you to fight again youre that you know this isnt this isnt good  you so when its yes its its its all its all come together that that reality that that bravado that machismo the bragging about how ruthless you are in business and its very hard do you think we have a warped sense of reality now given the abundance of all these different reality programs that are out there and people who are who are allegedly ordinary people gay on TV and saying ridiculous things in this circulating all over the Internet and all across well its not even reality anymore isnt it because its so contrived you know that theyve now they condense it now they contrived situations theres theres no real theres no real reality shows anymore if its bit pure its it its aimed to appeal to our sort of voyeuristic tendencies and were all well guilty you know from you know X Factor when they in the preliminary rounds they weird out the mentally ill to be sniggered out by you know millionaires were a part of that are people having proper nervous breakdowns in Big Brother were all part of that and you know thats what drama is when its when its real its conflict we dont want to watch 12 people sitting around having a nice conversation we want a fist fight if were gonna you know thats so it does appeal it sort of appeals to the the worst of our instincts I think earlier we touched the idea of you know ego and Prejudice you said this is something you interested in exploring your toenails called humanity and I think that probably sums up lots of your different work but  film and TV looking at peoples stories their lives and their egos turning to yourself rather than any character youve written or played do you feel fulfilled with what youre doing today is there some other big challenge or big project youd like to take on and give you more fulfillment I dont know Ive never Ive just always got up in the morning and wanted to fill the day with as much fun as possible you know I suppose thats everything Ive done is sort of slightly existential as well and from the office its about you know people becoming 1 are they doing the right thing Derek it was about people at the end of their life what what can they pass on even my children but flanimals was about the sort of futility of life and nature and ironic deaths and I dont know why that is really I think its funny I think its funny life I think is its its amusing because we take everything so seriously we care about everything passionately we have fights Wars worry about little things and then we die and the North effer and theres nothing it was pointless pointless we would turn we would tend to the stars so Ive always thought I want to fill my days with fun and if the end was tomorrow wed be happy oh well hopefully not but no no but um you know as I often sign off on Facebook Ive to my and Twitter I sign off I hope you die in your sleep and thats the nicest thing I can say to anyone I hope you die in a state if someone said find you if if we all died in our sleep I wouldnt care about anything do you know oh thered be nothing to worry about because thats what we worry about we dont worry about not existing we worry about oh my god am I gonna be Im not gonna be squashed by a safe and be on this street and am I gonna fall on a spike is it gonna be a long lingering death am I going to be eaten by wolves well I suppose said no youre gonna die in your sleep drunk Ill go bring it on well Im on that uplifting note lets get a few questions from the audience if youd like to ask a question and please raise your hand if youre selected wait  the microphone to reach you bee asking your question is any one particular youd like to pick oh sorry was that one where well I did somebody but oh no I know I dont want this is oh this is horrible I dont want to well Ill find some of this right the person over there towards the front third row can you see the karl Pilkington radio shows coming back any time the thing is with that is a people gasping and I do miss it and I and I even now and again listen to some of the old ones though everyone hear that question its Karl Pilkingtons our podcast coming back and I dont think it would work I think I think Karl became my little public experiment it was like a cross between stiff Elsa unscripted it was unscripted and that was that is that is that is real it was it was unscripted but it was it where he was like my little experiment I like a cross between I dont know have you seen the film lawnmower man it was like okay um cracking reference to anyone who has but I always thought that car was like Id found I found him a ten thousand year old caveman and shaved it thawed it out put clothes on it and then tried to teach it sort of art and philosophy and science and I think because he had a good brain I kept telling my said youve got a good brain youve got a brain you just dont use it right and you know he just he just he just found he found things that interested him which was furious and often apocryphal or nonsense just things on the internet you know baby baby born half monkey half as well its not true Karl its not true you go look at him I go its just a hairy kid hes a hairy kid hes a hair is a hundred percent human hes got a lot of hair says here hes half monkey it doesnt matter what it says their car its not half monkey so but I think he I think he became sort of a little bit more worldly wise its that chemistry that you guys captured in that show its hard to replicate that kind of chemistry oh you couldnt you couldnt contrive it it was it I discovered him he opened his little slackjaw once and he said something and I just I just my ears went up like that and I just thought this guys interesting its like I found him under a rock so I I dont think it would be the same I dont think hes that hes sort of retired now it doesnt matter how many times I very listen to it its still its still gotten its its I I listen to about people send me tweets of like clips and Id completely gotten about them but um its like the first time he heard about something that I might introduce a concept to him and its the first time here and I can hear his brain working its like a silence where you know its a things to me like like childlike it its a things why they said he said whats the most amazing fact ever oh cool what do you mean he went they said tell me something thatll blow me mind I said I said well the night room infinite is pretty amazing I said okay is well I said there was many even numbers as even an odd numbers put together he went no I told him I told him the theory that the you know the model of infinity and the infinite amount of chimps working on typewriters would write the computer Shakespeare he wouldnt have thought hed said if they read Shakespeare I went thats nothing I said thats the thats nothing to do with it right Eve god I just dont think theyd do that I dont know they know take out cognitive reason that theres no choice theyve chosen monkeys to take out choice in the reasons theyre just hitting away like that and he just couldnt get it he couldnt get that it was a yeah but so I I think hes learned his lesson and I think hes sort of content I just dont think it would work now well Thank You Ricky thank you lets have another question from lets go to the hand over there and the the bright blue t-shirt hi Ricky thanks so much  coming I wanted to ask as a kind of aspiring comedian myself youve had a really interesting background I remember in an interview or a video with Chris Rock Seinfeld and Louie CK talking about how you had a bizarre route into comedy because you wrote this may be the best sitcom ever and then years later did stand-up what advice would you have to aspiring comedians secondly very quickly would you ever are you going to work with Stephen Merchant again because I really miss all those projects you did with him I thought they were amazing and finally do you do you ever read the Facebook comments and if so you tempted to reply to them right okay okay what was the first one thats not good right yeah um right Id say well no its funny because Ive sort of quite thats true when I am so I got into comedy I was already a comedian bee I sort of decided Id become comedian he just sort of happened I went on the radio show and I and I was meant to be the head of speech I have a normal job I worked in an office  ten years which is what I based the office on and then I got a job in a radio station and I was meant to go in and and sort of be writing little things  the DJs and because Im so lazy I thought Ill just do this myself so I went in I popped up I did funny things and you know and then the bosses said listen youre youre rubbish at your real job so just do that and and it grew and I became like the the comedy turn on XFM got discovered by  four and all that so by the time I did stand-up I did think oh I should do that and I went along and my first four stand-up shows I sort of wrote over I wrote them like I was doing you know like an Edinburgh show or almost like a TV lecture and then I went out and I did it and it was fine this one Ive cracked it I did it differently III feel that I think I walked out with a few things on the back of my hand I didnt use multimedia I didnt use you know any structure and I just talked and I feel that Im a stand-up  the first time I feel that this tour I can say Im a stand-up and the first four tours I was in the ballpark so Id say and heres another revelation that shouldnt be a revelation it should be obvious stage time is everything you can you can write and write and write and it can be pretty funny and they can laugh but if you do the stage time you its its actually doing it I I cant think of an analogy theres nothing like it other than okay you could you could learn about making pots on a pot as well in theory you could learn if you can watch YouTube is you could be an expert and until you put your hands on it you know these are you know I think thats it youve got its stage time and our stage time is worth 0 hours writing if you if you havent done it yet its stage time its just doing it doing it you know and if you can do it if you could do it every night um you know you might be you might be getting and it depends what you mean by good do you mean good youre good and it works every night to 1 people or do you mean Im good because Im making money now and Im famous and everyone loves me I mean the latter yeah well then theres a whole lot of luck as well then my okay is my advice work hard and be lucky but I just think I think you have a passion  it youve got have a voice you got to find your voice how old do you 23 see 23 right youre young handsome what do you want to be a comedian  fuck you great ok another question then please lets go to the as a hand directly behind on the second row with the glasses hi with the adaption of the British office  American audiences do you think that the humor was also adapted and what do you think the difference is if you think there is a difference at all between British and American humor ok Ive thought about this a lot ok um doesnt mean Im right but I Ive got a good answer um well theres theres no real difference in humor right humor you know everyones different within their own what they find funny but humor is just about the same its its its its what we all have and what we all use I think we mean when we say humor we mean comedy is American comedy different - because were all the same were you know with outside cultural reference you know I think and and and bee I got onto the office even just doing stand-up people think it must be so what do you change to do go to America I dont change anything I dont change I dont change tap to ce it or pavement decide what they know what Im talking about you know I dont talk about last nights big brother winner I dont you know but when youre deed I try and deal in sort of Universal subjects and outside you know language barriers the people and people are the same theres dumb people and theyre smart people thats the big difference thats the only difference in dumb and smart right now Im but the difference between American comedy and English comedy I think was highlighted in the difference between the English and the American office and that is in Britain we we like the underdog we love the underdog we we we have a until theyre not the underdog anymore then we dont like them anymore but we celebrate we celebrate and we laugh and almost embrace failure whereas Americans that theyre there its a myth that Americans dont get already this doesnt thats ridiculous it total myth right but they dont use it all the time like we do to British guys meet they go or nice haircut they cant they cant they cant say oh you look good mate okay they go whats up with you what what what that it would blow our minds were as Americans that theyre not Americans arent afraid of sincerity you know and I think that thats the difference because David Brent was so sort of bad at his job an awful when it was so sort of depressing that American audience couldnt they couldnt they wouldnt have quite taken that I think so we had to make Steve Carell a little bit nice and more positive possibly better at his job a little bit better looking but not too much because that is the truth and and and it comes down to expectations and optimism and and all that because Americans are brought up and you know better than me but I feel that Americans are brought up to believe they can be the next president United States British people have told it wont happen to you so dont bother and I think that that is a its raining you know so I think I think that is the big difference thats the only thing like an eye can see and and then when were talking about the industry its very different the amount of right is the amount of money that that makes a big difference with what gets on television and stuff but but but thats not thats not to do with what you asked I dont think but I think I think pretty people are pretty much the same wherever you go if you if youre not being shot at and your firstborn isnt dying of dysentery you know we worry about the same things we worry about whats happening whats happening in our world you know you Ive seen it all the time if you if you youre watching the television and the news was a country it just sunk right youd go all Mike you didnt get any milk you know you we bring it back you always bring it back to you and people of us that thats the same anywhere great thank you lets go to the hand at the very back on the end of row hi Ricky just wanna say Im a massive fan of all of your work but also in particular extras thats definitely my favorite thank you I just want to know if you obviously Im not expecting its going to make a resurgence or anything like that but if it were to or or if you know at the time one of the celebrities had said no is there any celebrity or particular type of celebrity that youd have liked to have caricatured that you didnt get the opportunity to or even maybe in the modern climate is there anyone new that you would like to caricature as well itd be difficult now because everyone does it now every everyone when you know TV is now reduced to what two minute clip gets on YouTube  hits the next day everyones done it you know you theres I mean when the president United States is getting into Twitter fights with reality stars you know society is crumbled so I you know we used to take whats we used to take really dignified people and break them down like you know Shakespearean actors or you know but now whos left you know I mean we dont mother trays are doing carpool karaoke if she was alive now so I dont I dont know if extras would I dont know what I dont know what extras would have to do to satirize whats happening do you not I mean it would be it was like a quaint time then it was like people would go oh look David Bowie pretending to be well that that what the real presidents doing you know so III just I dont think it would have legs I dont know I dont know what who youd have to whos left you know  did you know comedians getting coffee and cars with Jerry Seinfeld you know yeah I think that was of its time and its only ten years old look whats happened in ten years whats next so when although I do miss it I did I really enjoy it but I enjoyed I mean I did enjoy you know working with my heroes and having fun with those people and deconstructing Fame but the thing I enjoyed most about it is the is like Andy and Maggies relationship I like the real characters that they were and thats why I made it extras and not actors because I think had to be people on the bottom rung watching looking at this mad world and I think you always have to do that with comedy I think you I think you have to there has to be a hill to climb so I am I I just dont I dont think theres any place to go now with celebrities and also theyre so in on it now they realize now its like oh if I do that then people will think Im not really like that that there was so that there to everyones to willing to do anything to be on telly  a minute thats the problem we have you know I just think people are told oh this will get 0 million YouTube hits I dont know whos saying no anymore I dont know whos saying no who are these people that you know that David Bao is great because it was the only thing he ever he ever did was the last thing he did you know that that now thats special but now you know people go on American chat shows and to show a clip they pay ping they play ping pong you know in masks or throw custard pies at each other its like okay why are we watching theres no interviews anymore dont know why theyre called chat shows anymore theres no chat its just a game so well maybe I should bring it back just to be angry I think weve got time  two more questions so lets go to the hand in the middle over there the white t-shirt Ill answer faster than we can get everyone who wants to ask question okay um because you havent been Umbra Hollister per I sort of feel we need to ask would you rather date a man who was a six-foot penis or would you rather date a man who instead of a penis had another tiny man the six-foot penis right he is basically a six-foot penis but he can talk youd sort of free to interpret what sort of questions that Im asking you you could you cant you cant come up with a question and then back out you havent thought it through so its a six foot hes a six foot penis who what walks along on testicles presumably right if not in now hes only get away with anything here right so so it hasnt got a face so he has got a face and so you could have like a little face on the helmet right right and hes got clothing and just his hound wit coming out of his suit and tie okay right yeah and and the other the other guy is hes a normal person except that instead of having a penis he has a little man and theres this little man at his own little man do I have to worry about him as well what he wants to eat and drink well like sure lead one at least like converse with him or know it well not in the restaurant that is still that is still his penis it just happens to look like a little man so okay so I think Im why am I going out with men anyway we could reverse it its a six foot Volvo [] stick to the man I want stick to the original question okay right a six-foot penis remember I was saying the worlds changed did you ask Arafat this Id listen I I cant be seen walking down the street with a six-foot penis so Im gonna go that and no one needs to know that my new boyfriend  some reason has got another little boyfriend in his trousers okay lets move on Oh how was the ultimate union Wow yes Eric thank  your talk today I was just gonna mention that I was quite me as that you said you dont bring politics into your comedy when you did a stand-up show entitled politics yeah I was gonna say youre in Oxd at the moment in case you didnt know and now by the question an Oxd and Cambridge have produced some really you know like really good comedians and growing out concerns Stephen Fry and a whole host of others you went to UCL yourself I wonder do you think you need to be clever to be funny is there a certain amount of intelligence required  comedy well I dont know would the answers no you dont need to be intelligent to be funny because theres lots of types of funny isnt there so but if youre talking about you know a stand-up comedian having something to say and making people think as well then I think you certainly have to be analytical and I think you have to have an angle so youre later to have to thought something out and I think you have to have a certain amount of fairness as well I think the Im very I try and make my jokes I try and make the targets fair III dont joke about things that people cant help I joke about peoples behavior often or and thats just thats just personal and I also think that it is it it is a bonus if you can make people think as well as laughs because a lot laughs easy I could fall over and youd laugh right thanks a lot in fact one of you would film it  YouTube I imagine him or and 20 pounds  so I I think that um comedy is best probably is is clever but then theres something very nice and visceral and you know it is funny to see someone fall over you know I mean that Im sort of metaphorically but you know IIIi love Lauren Hardy and what was nice about them was the the sort of relationship that was so precarious and there we were laughing their situation to pretension of one and the the guy who didnt care but the guy didnt care the pretentious guy who thought that he was cleverer than the other one he always ended up down you know face down in the duck pond so I think if you analyze most comedy theres theres theres something clever in it theres another layer as opposed to it just looking at YouTube clips of people falling down cellars which are hilarious by the way well I was just gonna say the reason I asked that question because you were talking about karl Pilkington and like I dont know if you would say that hes a clever man but he was certainly incredibly funny he was incredibly funny but it was attitude that was funny and if you took it by himself there was still the relationship it still needed a couple of pretentious media types thinking they were winning but they were losing because he didnt care what we thought so there was still a little bit of a dynamic going on not just if karl Pilkington went on the radio and said all right world is what I think monkeys in that people go wise I spoke to her but because he was goaded by a couple of pseudo-intellectual media types thinking that they were embarrassing in it there became there became a texture to it and people wanted him to win people loved him winning winning was maybe making me laugh or being proved right first something that you know so theres still there was still something going on it wasnt just it wasnt just a man saying stupid things so yeah does that make sense yeah I think so thank you very much okay lets take one final super quick bonus question so these two when I choose one sorry yeah wait  the microphone okay I dont want the responsibility thank you I was wondering about your relationship with Stephen Merchant and how the creative process changes when youre working with a partner versus well um very quickly with any collaboration Ive worked with Steve Ive worked with Matt Robinson Ive worked with David Koepp and I always had one rule which is let me get my own way or Im sulking and one veto and its out so what you dont do is you dont you never come in with two different scripts and and and then fight  you you work on something and if one of you doesnt like something it doesnt go in because you dont want to be left with anything that one of you doesnt like so often you might throw out you might throw out 90% of the stuff right but the bit thats left you both love but other than that theres loads of ways to collaborate you know team right in you know I think the best idea wins I think thats thats what it comes down to but if youre if youre any sort of an outer then you sort of you sort of want to do it your way all the time so theres theres always a compromise with with one other person there to other people and two heads are better than one but I always think that the trouble I have with collaboration is it doesnt feel like you know with team writing theres less fun in it  me I like the day but I dont like doing things that wont come but I wont come didnt completely come up with all love its a difficult thing to say and I do it because its fun coming up with stuff so if I was in a room and I was you know a tractor host and I had all these writers and they came up with everything  me I wouldnt enjoy that because the bit thats missing was the fun of me coming up with stuff does that make sense thats the buzz  me having an idea thats my adrenaline rush and then and then trying to not ruin it so just walking into a room and getting the script and then read nor OQ at that but that means nothing to me and it could be great and some people love it and it could be lucrative but I feel that even it into a certain degree I dont love as much as coming up with the with the stuff so I just think it depends on what sort of person you are I think Im an egomaniac great well untunately thats all weve got time  but thank you so much  coming along today its a great way  every end there to thank you and if you could please remain seated while Ricky leaves the room but join me in thanking Ricky  coming along today you"
21,0,"Did you see the results? -Yeah.n-Landslide victory ... Modi, Modi, Modi. I told you.nI said, ""Dont do Indian elections."" Why cant I talk about Indian politics?nIm Indian. Youre Indian? You didnt even live there. How do you call yourself an Indian? My familys from there. People think that youre American.nYoure a white washed. No, Im not. You know menand uncle are brown, you know that. How? But you dont behave like a brown. -What does that even mean?n-You think that youre a smart white dude. Sorry, youre not. If you dont want mento talk about politics, -what do you want me to talk about?n-Go ahead with Bollywood. -Im not talking about Bollywood.n-You should. -Im not talking about Bollywood.n-No, Indian food. - spicy Indian food.n-Oh, yeah. Biryani. -You want me to do 26 minutes...n-Oh, yes. on biryani? Yeah, you can do an hour. You could do an hour. Okay. What if I just do the updatenon what happened? -Apology is the only update you can give.n-Only update you can do. Maybe you can put it as... "" :nApology Regarding Indian Elections."" You want me to do "" :nApology About Indian Elections?"" -Yes.n-""Sorry, I Didnt Listen."" Hello. Thank you so much! Thank you. Hello, how are you? Hi! Welcome to  . Im Hasan Minhaj.nThank you guys so much  coming out. Oh, man. Now, look. India just wrapped upnits general election, and we have to talk about it. I mean, can you imagine if we didnt? Like every white person would be like,n""Is Hasan okay?"" And every Indian person would be like,n""Good, he learned."" So heres a quick update. This electionnpretty much came down to two parties.  BJP,na right-wing Hindu Nationalist group led by incumbent Prime Minister,nNarendra Modi, and the Congress Party,nled by Rahul Gandhi. And the results were stunning. Prime Minister Narendra Modinis celebrating a sweeping victory Narendra Modi now set na second five-year term as prime minister of the worlds biggest democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, India has spoken, and India has spoken decisively. Okay, thats Navika Kumar, and we featured her the last timenwe talked about the elections. So she hit me up on Twitter and invited me to come on her shown a debate. And I said... ""Hell no."" nThat show is way too intense. I would get destroyed like Kings Landing. Make your point! All right, make your point! Respond to the basic issues. Can you just calm down? Why are you getting personal? I think you suffer from amnesia. Stop playing the victim card. You did not makenthe political point that you should have. Do they just slap everyonenright bee they put them on air? Also, how do they fit so many peoplenon that show? Its like they mapped the populationnof India onto their news shows. Now, look. We know this. Its not a huge surprisenthat the BJP won. It was the size of their victorynthat was shocking. Modis BJP Party won 303 out of 2 seats in the lower  of Parliament.nIts well beyond the simple majority a party in India needsnto m a government.  BJP took so many seats, they won a majority on their own. y pulled it offnby expanding beyond the Hindi Belt, which sounds like somethingnGucci got in trouble  selling. But... the Hindi Belt is actually a region thats made up entirelynof Hindi-speaking states. In this election,nthe BJP managed to expand into every part of India. y are now 6%nof the lower  of Parliament. Meanwhile, the Congress Party endednthis election with 2 seats. Thats not even 10% of the lower house. And if you think things couldnt getnany worse  Rahul Gandhi, youre very wrong. And one of the highlightsnof the BJPs amazing victory is Amethi, where the partys Smriti Iranindefeated Congress President Rahul Gandhi. An event that has lednto even more humiliation  the congress. I would like to say Smriti Irani has won. I want to congratulate her.n citizens of a Amethi have decided. I respect their decision. Okay, Rahul couldnt even winnhis own district, which his family held  decades. He lost to a BJP candidatennamed Smriti Irani, whos a mer soap opera star. And trust me, she does not fuck around. Okay, why did they film this entire shownon Google  View? It feels like the directornis like, ""Wait. Im just looking  a brunch spot.nLet me just... let me just get my Matrix on."" Killing the competitionnisnt just a metaphor.  BJP ran some wild candidates. Like Anantkumar Hegde who said, ""As long as we have Islam in the world,nthere will be no end to terrorism,"" which kind of sounds likenStephen Millers wedding vows. Or Sakshi Maharaj, who hasn3 criminal cases against him, including robbery and murder, but by far the craziest BJP candidatenwas Pragya Thakur, who won in Bhopal. Now, she recently pissed offnpretty much all of India. Sadhvi Pragya has proved to benthe biggest embarrassment  the BJP. She has called Mahatma Gandhis assassinna patriot. You cant say that. Thats like calling Ted Bundyna ladies man. Now, Pragya eventually apologized. But this isnt the first time shes runninto trouble. Last year, a terrorism chargenwas laid against her as a suspect in a 2008 mosque bombingnthat killed six people. Visiting a Bhopal Hindu templen a cleansing ceremony, she adamantly maintains her innocencenin the case. I am 100% innocent. Okay, technically... Pragya is out on bailnbecause she has cancer. But shes also been accusednof plotting a deadly bomb attack. So, I just dont know how to do this joke. You know what I mean?nCause, like, what was her Make-A-Wish? You know what I mean? y were like,n""Hey, do you want to meet  Rock?"" And then she was like,n""Can he help me blow up a mosque?"" I told you it was fucked up. Now look, its easy to reducenthe BJPs popularity to one issue, whether you look Pragyanand think Hindu nationalism or you look at Congress and you thinknof corruption and incompetence. But dont get onenof the biggest reasons the BJP won is Narendra Modi himself. Voters wanted himnto be the face of India. So even though hes knownn not taking questions from the press, the stakes of this election were so high,neven he had to sit down  an interview with one of the most feared journalistsnin India, Bollywood star Akshay Kumar.  fashion statement you makenis very interesting. Have you styled it yourself? This is a good question. I want to know if you eat mangoes. I eat mangoes,nand I enjoy it very much. Okay, that sounds like a five-year-oldninterviewing their doll. Akshays like, ""Do you like mangoes? I like mangoes. Would you like some more tea?"" Hes so charming, I almost gotnabout the Rafale scandal. Now, I totally get why Indians love Modi. Hes so Indian.n day bee voting ended, he climbed the Himalayan Mountainsnand meditated in a shrine  18 hours. He basically did what Americans thinknIndians do all the time. Look, you may not agree with his politics,nbut the man knows a good photo op. Hes like, ""Look, I want to meditate.nGet the cameras ready."" THERES-- FUCK-- THIS IS A THREE CAMERA SHOOT! Look what theyre cutting. y had to cut wide on the walk.nyre getting his lineup. y got his lineup! We have multiple angles insidenof a cave, you guys.  point is Modi is savvy and revered, and I know this because Indian trollsnare blowing up my mentions. y dont like my sweater.ny dont like my hand motions. This person just wants me to knownthat Im a son of a bitch. I love how he wrote, ""Just so you know."" Hes like, ""Hey, just FYI. Youre a son of a bitch."" But I picked up on a general theme. Modi supporters think I was tryingnto swing the election. ""Let me take this timento thank Hasan Minhaj, who helped us electna right-wing government in India. Thank you."" Okay, let me make this very clear. Comedians cant swing elections. This is insane. George W. Bush won twicenwhen Jon Stewart  was on the air. Were talking peak Stewart, you guys. He had black hair.nHe had the shoulder pads. He took down Crossfire. Everyone was like,n""I get my news from J-Stew. Hes the truth-teller."" Meanwhile, Bush went back-to-back.nComedians dont do shit. But... I cant go online without Desi trolls telling menI ruined democracy. So clearly,nI didnt need to go to Navikas show. Navikas show came to me. I think he made Modi win. Why is he talking aboutnIndian politics anyway? He has no clue about Narendra Modi.nHe has no clue about BJP. This guys an anti-Indian. You are my least favoritenDaily Show correspondent. -Not funny.n-Excuse me. That is not the point.nCan I make my point? -Can I make my point?n-Make your point! Its only Modi, Modi, Modi  him. I tried to tell him notnto talk about this, and he never listened to me. Hes a complete idiot and a buffoon. Why are you getting personal? Why are you getting personal? Im sorry. Im sorry. Lets not get personal. Hasan Minhaj is a son of a bitch!"
22,0,"Tonight, I want to talk aboutnthe one sport Indians dominate. Not the spelling bee... Cricket.nNow, growing up I hated watching cricket. Imagine sitting on the couch with your dadn a week and watching this. Just bee lunch. Eleven minutes to go. Boycott bowled in sweaternand cap on Wednesday and it looks as thoughnhell do the same thing today. Slight delays out therenwhilst the England bowlers are not entirely happy with the ball. That live action Brooks Brothers catalog goes on  five days. But now, the game has gonenfrom sweater vests and tea breaks to something thats actually fun to watch. This week, the 2019 Cricket World Cupnkicks off in England, and thats a big dealn fans around the world. India! India!  India, India!  Pakistan! Barmy army! Barmy army! We win baby, yeah! Oh, incredible! Okay, that guy who looks likenLittle Richard fucked a minion perfectly captures ""cricket mania."" Now just  perspective, the last timenIndia and Pakistan played each other in the World Cup,nover a billion people tuned in. In terms of viewers,nthats nine Super Bowls, 2 Game of Thrones finales or a billion Murphy Brown reboots. Nobody watched Murphy Brown, Im sorry. And yet, when Americans hearnthe word ""cricket,"" they think of the insect, the cola, or the data plan you getnif you want to start selling cocaine. But cricketnis so much more than you think. Cricket can be usedn international diplomacy, aka, ""cricket diplomacy."" India and Pakistan have used cricketnto both ease tensions and inflame tensions. After the terrorist attacks in Kashmir, India reportedly threatened to boycottnits match with Pakistan. But ""cricket diplomacy""ngoes way beyond South Asia. In the early 2000s, Fidel Castro tried to get Cubansnto play cricket instead of baseballnas a middle finger to the United States. In 200, China built Grenadana cricket stadium as a thank you  not recognizing Taiwan. Cricket has even played a vital rolenin Afghanistan. You guys remember Afghanistan, right? You know, from war. Minus cricket, we are nothing. Because when we were young,nwe played only cricket. Psychologically, cricket takes their mindnaway from bad things. People wont participate in elections,nbut they will in cricket. It has become essentialnto the Afghan people. Thats incredible. Even American politicians recognizencrickets international importance. If we are searching  a modelnof how to meet tough international challengesnwith skill, we need only looknto the Afghan national cricket team. Afghanistan did not even havena cricket team a decade ago and last month the team made itnto the World 20 Championships. You know whats weird? She gave that exact same speechnat Goldman Sachs  $200,000. Look, bankers love cricket, too. Cricket is a global sportnwith the potential to unite nations. But heres whats frustrating. In 2019, cricket is becomingnless inclusive because of corruption and greed, and no country is morento blame than India. India has become so dominant it is stifling the growthnof international cricket, which is odd because the goalnwas originally about expansion.  game was spread by the British Empire, the worlds first spam bot.ny took cricket everywhere. India, Sri Lanka, the West Indies,nthey even spread cricket to prison. Yes, England straight-up builtna continent-sized jail and called it Australia. y took cricket to Canada,neven the American colonies. America used to play cricket,nbut then the United States was like, ""Yo, fuck your sport. Fuck your tea. fuck your pronunciationnof the word privacy, aluminum and take us off your schedule. Cheerio."" And then, Americans took their slavesnand created baseball.  Empire spread cricketnall over the world, and they used cricketnas a way to export their culture and civilize the locals. Cricket has been callednthe ultimate colonial ""civilizer,"" which is basically Winston Churchillsnversion of Grand ft Auto. Its super fun.nI dont if you guys know this, but if you go, R1, R1, left, right,nleft, right, circle, circle, you unlock smallpox. Now... as the colonies got better at cricket, it became a way to beat the colonizersnat their own game. Most of the countries,nand the top countries that play the game, has that little element of wantingnto get back at the English. At leastnon the cricket field, with the bat against an Englishman holding a ball, he could smash him  six after sixnand prove that he was not his inferior.  question of self-esteem, the question that here is an Indian,na brown face with brown hand who could measure up to a white man. I love that. India whooped Britains assnat their own game.  only thingnthat would piss off Britain more is if India also took Michael Caine. Thats right.nHes ours, and he fucking loves it. But today, India runs shit. India commands 70% of the global revenue, and in 2017, generatedn$1 billion in sponsorships and its mostly thanks to three letters. - IPL, the Indian Premier League. Youre a fan? res just, like, one randomnIndian dude like, ""Fuck, yeah! This is my episode. Last week you did NRA,nnow were doing cricket."" Meanwhile, theres 200 other people like, ""What the fuck is going on? You know crazy shit is happeningnin Alabama."" Just wait. This is  you.  IPL... plays a type of cricket called T20, okay? Its a shorter, explosive type of cricket,nwhich took a game that looks like it was inventednby Mitt fucking Romney and turned it into a cultural phenomenon. Oh, yes! Oh, wow! Du Plessis! Oh, the ripper!nWhat a take!  Mustard Man is back, baby! Look, I think-- I think he just lives at the stadium. IPL cricket has so many viewers in India,nit can sell everything from soda, cars, even condoms, which is notnsomething Indians are known  using. ...right bowlernwith the hope of making inroads... If youre not watching the match,ncan I watch something else? Love sex? Durex. What the fuck? Wait. Wait, wait, lets break this down. He handed her the remote with his erection through the fabric of his clothes. Like, how did the director direct this?nHes like, ""Listen to me, Vinay... I need you to get a boner.""nAnd hes like, ""On it."" In the prompter, it just says ""tense up."" Now as cringey as that video is, sex and spectacle made cricketnwhat it is today. In 2008, the IPL flew in NFL cheerleaders inn a match, and it broke every Indian mannin a 0-foot radius. Okay, wait, this dude is talking aboutnbringing sexuality to cricket like its the solution to global warming. n theres some random army general showing off a picture of cheerleadersnon his BlackBerry. Meanwhile, the horniest man in South Asianis just recording them, while his best friend is just whispering, ""Please send bobs,nI need bobs immediately."" Look... Turning cricket into a thirst trap,nit wasnt an accident. It was something that came directlynfrom the leagues infamous founder, Lalit Kumar Modi,naka, Indian Bobby Jindal. Did you not violate certain normsnof Indian culture?  pom-pom girls,nblonde pom-pom girls. If I were in India, Id see that as a slapnto the Indian womanhood. Again, you know, we did thingsnthat were out of the ordinary. ually, they talk about the IPL as a family product,nthey talk about IPL where the whole family from the grandmother,nto the grandfather, to the grandchildren,nto the hot wife, to the husband are all actually looking wardnto watching a program together. I dont think he meant to say ""hot wife,""nbut that Freudian slip is very telling. Lalit Modi started the IPL in 2008nwith an initial investment of $2 million. Two years later,nthe IPL was worth $.1 billion. Modi made cricket exciting.nShorter matches, shorter seasons, and he paid the best players in the worldnto come to India. Everyone was giving Lalit props. Most innovative business leader of Indianis Lalit Modi. Youre such a celebrity now. Is it true you can sell oil to the Arabs? I wish I could do that. IPL without Lalit Modi is like... A sugar-free candy bar. Modi was celebratednthroughout the cricket world  years and by years, I mean two. Exactly two. Once the most sought after mannin Indian cricket, now an outcast, Modi has beennfound guilty of rigging IPL bets. He has also been found guiltynof charging a facilitation fee to the tune of $80 million.  9-year-old is also guiltynof not disclosing that his relatives had stake in a companynthat purchased rights  the IPL website. In 2013, the BCCI,nwhich is Indias Cricket Board, found Lalit Modi guilty of eight countsnof misconduct and kicked him out of the IPL.nNow thats ballsy. Can you imagine firing someonenwho made your organization billions of dollarsnjust because theyre an egomaniac? No, Im asking you.nFacebook, Tesla, Twitter. Imagine it. Please. Modi denies the charges,nbut rather than facing them in court, he left India and started showing upnon cable news like 2018 Roger Stone. -I am sorry. I am really sorry.n-re will be a time when you will tire -of doing this.n-Who are you to call me a fugitive? Who the hell do you think you are? You are sounding bitter.nI am not bitter at all. I am not going to argue with a personnwho has a closed mind. He tells me the question. Bee I can answer,nhe goes to somebody else. My complaint is-- My complaint is--nMy complaint is-- My complaint is-- I think he was just tryingnto pick one complaint, and his whole system just crashed. Hes just  like, ""My complaint is--nMy complaint-- My complaint-- Just recharge."" But then, while Lalit was in Thailand,nhe hit peak uncle. re must be a charge sheetnor there must be a complaint. Where is it? -Okay. That--n-Where is it? Seven years have gone by.nI want you to ask the ED, where is the charge sheet?nOne second! One second! Oh, my God! Every brown person on the planetnhas been that reporter, right? res just some fob in cargo pantsnyelling at you, wagging his finger and then we all do the samenfull-body nod. Were like, ""All right. Im using my entire bodynto agree with you. Please shut the fuck up and let me leaventhe mosque parking lot."" Now, look. I gotta give propsnwhere props are due. What Lalit Modi did with the IPLnwas revolutionary. Okay? Thanks to him,ncricket revenue exploded, between TV, streaming, live matches, condoms and sponsorship deals. It was like India had an oil boom. This influx of cash and eyeballs redefined the waynglobal cricket is governed, and thats the problem. Now, fair warning.nIm about to start doing graphs. So, if you have friends,nnows the time to hang out with them. On paper, global cricket is governednby an organization called the  Cricket Council,naka, the ICC.  ICC oversees all 10ncricket playing nations. yre top of the food chain. Indian cricket is governed bynthe Board of Control  Cricket in India, aka, the BCCI, okay? And they are, and I mean this nicely, gigantic assholes. In theory, the ICC oversees the BCCInat the international level, but thanks to Indian cricket,nthe BCCI makes so much money and commands so much viewership, theyve made the ICC their bitch, and every other country is cednto revolve around the BCCI. y bully other countriesnto get what they want. y make it practically impossiblen Indian players to compete in any eign T20 tournaments, and you just cant say no to them. Just look at the upcoming World Cup, okay? Sixteen teams played in 2007. Now its down to ten, the fewest number of teamsnin more than two decades. Fewer teams increases the oddsnof India being in more World Cup matches. Now, India in more World Cup matchesnmeans more money  advertisers in Indian cricket. So the BCCI is constantly just throwingntheir weight around.  most striking examplenof this might be a 2008 scandal called Monkeygate. Now I know that sounds like Jane Goodallngot #MeToo-ed, but it had nothing to do with that. Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh faces a three-match suspensionnafter the referee ruled he called Andrew Symonds, Australias only non-white member,n""a monkey"" during the two teams recent matchnin Sydney. Wait, there was a racism scandalnin Australia, and the bad guy wasnt Australian? Harbhajan Singh denied saying ""monkey,"" and India threatenednto pull out of the tournament unless the ICCnlet Harbhajan Singh off the hook. So Australia fell in line and was like,  ""Hey, dont do that.nIts our fault. We need the money and the viewers, we shouldnt have had a black playernon our team."" Think about how insane that is. Its likenAustralias asking  giveness, even though their teamnand their player was the victim. Thats like cing a black familynto invite BBQ Becky over to their next cook out. yre like, ""This is goodn racial unity. We need to do this."" se behind-the-scenes power playsnare just the start. In 201, India launched a cricket coup to take over international cricket by combining ces with Englandnand Australia. yre known as "" Big Three,""nand they run everything.  Big Three,nled by India, seized control of the  Cricket Councilsnkey committees and the way its funds are distributed. In the next eight years, ICC events, including the World Cup,nare expected to harvest record revenues of at least $2. billion.  Big Three will take the lions share, with India alone netting upwardsnof $00 million. Now, you might be wondering, why would all the other countries agreento such a shitty deal? Well, they didnt really have a choice. I know of a lot of countriesnthat are against the takeover. y voted against it initially, and thenneveryone just went to them individually and said, ""Listen, if you come with us,nthis is what you can get. This is what you will get."" And eventually, they all fell in line. Holy shit. se guys sound like the Mafia... or FIFA. Now bee 201, every member of the ICCngot an equal share of cricket revenue. But under Indias proposed plan,nmore money went to  Big Three than to all other nations combined. With India getting by far the most. Think of thisnentire corruption clusterfuck like an Indian nesting doll, okay?  outside is the BCCI. Inside that is the IPL,nand inside the IPL is Lalit Modi. Now... Even though hes long gone,nthe moves he made are at the core of how Indian cricket ended up here.nNow, Modi cant go back to India because he would likely get arrested,nand he believes hell be killed. So these days he livesnin self-exile in London, but... I had to meet the guynso I flew to London to ask Lalit Modi aboutnIndias stranglehold on cricket and his role in all of it. How would you describe yourselfnin three words? And you cannot use the wordsn""big dick energy."" Controversial. Controversy was the central pillarnof the IPL. To me, youre like P.T. Barnumnmeets Vince McMahon with a dash of Billy McFarlandnfrom the Fyre Festival. Thank you very much,nI really appreciate that. Thats a real compliment. I like it. You like those three-- res not many people who can playnall these three roles together. -You mean just shady, shady...n-And more shady. Thats it. Its weird that he openly identifiesnas shady. It would be like if Imagine Dragonsnopenly identified as bad. Now this isnt new. Lalit Modi has been doing shady shitnsince he was in college. It was as a studentnat Duke University that Lalit Modi got caught in the circle of drugs. In 198, he was arrested on chargesnof trafficking cocaine and assault with a deadly weaponnwith an intent to kill. Modi pleaded guilty to his crimesnand entered a plea bargain. Hey, come on. It was the 80s, baby! Everyone was pushing coke. Now, I  know weve got to talknabout cricket, but just bear with me. I had to ask Lalit Modinwhat went down at Duke. To me, youre like Zion Williamson.nBoth of you guys were one and done. -He was one and done to go to the league,n-Yeah. and you left to avoid jail timenand kidnapping charges. Oh, no. re was no jail time.nIt was only-- I had to do 200 hoursnof community service. re were no drugs there.nWe were going to buy. You were on the waynto get some coke and guns. -And we got robbed on the way.n-Right. But it doesnt matter.nIts part of my life, I dont deny it. You know, I have no shame about it. Yeah! I mean, look, Lalit.nIt was a long time ago. -Its fine!n-I dont care about it. I have no problem with it, others do. - haters hate.n-I completely agree. -Im saying--n-You let them know youll do a bumpnand stay strapped immediately. -Absolutely.n-And if they want to pop off... y can pop off,nand I have no problem with that. Law encement agencies are just gonnanpop off. Its what they do. During his time with the IPL, Lalit Modi built up a rap sheetnlike he was trying to get Future to write a song about him. But I had to push him on itnbecause whether he denies it or not, Lalit Modi is complicit. His alleged corruption is indicativenof how cricket is rotten to its core. Youve repeatedly said,n""What have I been accused of?"" -Yes.n-Ill just read it right to your face. "" BCCI found you guiltynof eight counts of misconduct, including rigging bidsn franchise owners you preferred and accepting kickbacksnfrom broadcast deals."" -One minute.n-Im not finished. "" Indian government has openednmore than a dozen investigations into your financial dealings with the IPL,nincluding money laundering.""  havent found zilch, and as far as Im concerned,nthey can keep digging, digging, digging til the cows come home. And they aint going to find zilchnbecause there isnt zilch.  majority of the peoplenwho run away from the country... Are kind of guilty. And then have given interviews. Im on every network all the timenand every time. -And Im there because I have no guilt.n-Look, youre either-- I can look myselfnin the mirror every morning and be very happy and look at it,nand I say, ""You look great."" Okay? ""Carry on."" Thats a joke. I wish I was that confident,njust bombing and being like, ""Its cool."" Because he created the IPL, Lalit Modi knows the power dynamicsnbetween the BCCI and the ICC, and he has strong feelingsnabout whats going on now. Does the BCCI have too much powernover the ICC? What do you mean?ny control the bloody ICC. re is no ICC without the BCCI. Do you think even a single matchncan take place without India? No. You think any broadcaster will buynany rights of the ICC without India? No. Is the BCCI preventing cricketnfrom spreading to smaller countries? -Yes.n-Is that bad  the sport? Very bad  the sport. Lalit Modi got banned  life in 2013, but the problems continuednlong after he was kicked out. One of the best-known scandals involvednthe BCCIs mer president N. Srinivasan. During his tenure, playersnand officials were arrested  rigging gamesnand illegal betting. One of the teams involvednwas owned by N. Srinivasan, and one of the arrested officialsnwas his own son-in-law. Even though Srinivasan was not charged, it was so messy,nthe Indian Supreme Court had to step in, ced him to step down, and callednhis conflict of interest ""nauseating.""  even gotna mer Supreme Court Justice, RM Lodha, to set up a commissionncalled "" Lodha Committee"" to clean up Indian cricket. Do you understand what I just said?n Supreme Court got involved. Can you imagine if RBG was in chargenof investigating Deflategate? Look, you know Roberts would sidenwith the s.  Lodha Committee was set upnover three years ago and to this day, many of those court-ordered changesnstill havent been made. Indian cricket has gotten to a pointnwhere its too big to fail. Dont you think you created this problemnby creating the IPL? I did, and I didnt esee this. Thats right. I am to blame  it. This is the only thingnyouve taken blame . I am. I take blame  creatingnthe war chest  the BCCI, completely. Out of all the things Ive saidnto you today... Yes. Those I dont care about.nThis I do take the blame . You created the behemothnthat is now bullying... the rest of the world and preventingnthe spread of cricket around the world? Thats right.nAnd I feel very bad about that. Modi helped create the cash cownthat gives the BCCI power. y always seemnto put Indian cricket first at the expense of the global game. Now, Ayaz Memon is one of the most prominentncricket journalists in the world, and he echoes the same concern. Indian cricket establishmentnis phenomenally rich now, and I think that its a bit of a shamenthat Indias not been able to take that agenda ward. y should be in the vanguardnof spreading the gospel of cricket. Why dont they want to spread the game? yre caught in a bit of a dilemma. We are the most powerful cricket bodynin the world, and if we take it furthernthan what exists today, will it dilute our power? Indian Colonel Sanders is right. Look, one of the most significant ways India is holding back cricketnmight be this. Possible Olympic gold medalist? Well, not if the BCCI have a saynin the matter.  ICC  a while now have been tryingnto get cricket included as an Olympic sport, because they believenit will help the game grow.  BCCI, on the other hand,ndont want an Olympic Committee interfering with their business. Come on! India should love the Olympics.nYou know this. We love recognition, and we love gold, but we have neither,nbecause lets be real, India sucks at the Olympics. India is a country of 1.3 billion peoplendating back to roughly 2,000 BC. In that time,nwe have won 28 Olympic medals. -Whoo-hoo!n-Okay. Michael Phelps is a stoner dating backnto the year 198. In that time, hes won 28 Olympic medals. Our whole country is equalnto one Subway spokesman. But cricket could actually change that. I think cricket can becomenan Olympic sport where you have at least 16,nif not 20 or 2, nations playing it at a certain levelnwhich demands the attention -of the Olympic Committee.n-So, whos the bad guy here?  stumbling block would be the BCCI.nIn the past, theyve been, you know, ""Why get into the Olympics?nThis is a sport we control, we run. Its very lucrative. Its very popular."" -Ayaz, we need cricket in the Olympics.n-Absolutely. I think a lot of players are sayingnthey need cricket in the Olympics. Do you know how many medalsnIndia has won in the past century? -28, yes.n-Do you know what the majority come in? Badminton. No, dont undermine badminton.nIndia is doing very well in badminton. -Im not-- Im just saying--n-Its breaking the hegemony of China. That sounds great, Ayaz,nbut I dont want to win gold medals in sports that electrical engineersnat Google play. My research team told me thatntechnically, India has won more medals in field hockey than badminton,nwhich is actually worse. Now if you dont think the Olympicsnare important, how the hell do we know what this is? Do you guys know what this is? Curling, yes! We have a better understandingnof competitive ice cleaning than one of the biggest sportsnin the world. That is pathetic!  saddest part about all of this is that cricket can bensuch a ce  good. Weve already seennso many inspiring examples. Afghanistan went from playing cricketnin refugee camps to playing cricket at the highest level. Now, heres the crazy part. India was one of the first countriesnto invest in Afghanistans cricket team, and on June 1,nAfghanistan will play Australia in the opening roundnof this years World Cup. ir rise shows what the spreadnof cricket can mean to a country. Now as an Indian, Im proudnthat were so dominant at cricket and that the game is finally excitingnto watch. Look, we took something our colonizersnced on us, and we made it our own. But my complaint is... My complaint is... My complaint is... My complaint is... My complaint is were so concernednwith owning the sport that it isnt aboutnplaying cricket anymore. Its about colonizing it  ourselves."
23,0,"Hasan, I saw your show on student loans.nIt was amazing. Im actually gonna do an episodexa0nabout the Indian election. -What?n-Are you out of your mind? Youre being stupid now. Indian elections are a definite no-no. re is a lot of garbage outside, and that garbagexa0nis going to come on your face if you open your mouth on Indian politics. You cannot talk aboutxa0Narendra Modi.nYou cannot talk aboutxa0Priyanka Gandhi. You cannot talk out in the open. -What about on the Internet?n-Never on Internet! You are an NRI. You are an ABCD. nYou are an American-born desi. You dont know the Indian politics. It is the worlds largest democracy,nand Im gonna talk about it. Politics is like a jalebi,xa0nround, round, round, you dont know where it ends,nwhere it starts. Democracy is  people with power,npeople with muscle power and money power. -It is not  you and me.n-Its  gangs. Youre going to make millionsnof people angry. With the Hindus, with the Muslims,nwith the Sikhs. y are going to kill you. You will be no more. re will be an accident.nYou will be burnt to death. Youre gone. [speaking Hindi]nDo you want a problem? -No, I dont want a problem.n-n why do you want to do it? You can talk about anything else. -Talk about cricket.n-Talk about sneakers. -Thats more comical.n-Thats more comical. -Do you know, your name--n-Hasan means ""nice"" in Arabic. India is not Arabia. Your name rings a bellxa0nthat you are a terrorist. Period. -Youre maybe... a Pakistani agent.n-A Pakistani agent. -Im a Pakistani agent?n-[woman] Yeah. Could be. -[theme  playing]n-[crowd shouting] [siren wailing] [audience cheering] Hello! Thank you. Thank you so much. Im Hasan Minhaj. Welcome to  .nThank you guys so much. Thank you. All right, tonight... I want to talk about politics in India. I know, Im sorry. I know, I know.xa0nLook, talking about politics in India can get you in a lot of trouble,xa0nespecially... because Im Indian and Muslim. Its very weird to be somethingxa0nthat people love and then also be somethingnthat people do not like. Right, its like if one half of youxa0nwas Oreo cookie and then the other half with Muslim. res no winning. It makes everything so much morencomplicated and confusing. And just a few weeks ago,nthings got even worse after a terrorist attack in Kashmir. re has been a major escalationnin tension between Pakistan and India. More than 0 people are deadxa0nafter a suicide bombing rammed into a bus filled with troops. A Pakistani-based terror groupxa0nhas claimed responsibility  the attack. This is the most serious escalationxa0nin yearsxa0 between the two nuclear-armed adversaries. Kashmir has been disputed territorynbetween India and Pakistan since 197. And heres how controversial Kashmir is. Look, no. Your eyes arent messed up.  You dont need to get them checked.nThat map is blurred because we were told that we could not show a map of Kashmirxa0 without Indian-approved bordersxa0nbecause if we did,xa0 the Indian government would likely sue us. So, jokes on you, India, because Americans couldnt even findxa0nKashmir even if it were on a map. Clearly, the stakes are incredibly high.  bombing last monthnwas the deadliest terrorist attackxa0 on Indian ces in Kashmirxa0nin almost 30 years. India responded by sending bombersxa0ninto Pakistan, which they say hit terrorist strongholds,nbut Pakistan reported that India missed their targetsnand just hit a bunch of trees. And now,xa0Pakistan plansnto file a complaint with the UN, saying that the attackxa0non trees is eco-terrorism. And India was like, ""We would havexa0hitxa0nsomething if our maps werent so blurry. And just so you know,xa0nthose trees are terrorists."" Now India is adamantxa0nthat they hit their targets, but people started askingxa0nthe Indian government  proofxa0 and then Indian cable news was like, ""Release the pundits."" He had nothing in mind, not his family,nonly the country. -That, I salute--n-[woman] No, but they want proof. -Im coming to that.n-But they want proof what they destroyed. This is a moment of celebration  India. Not at all. You are liars! -You are hysterical people!n-Oh? Yes, people like you are a cursenon this nation. Do you know that?xa0nYou are a curse on this nation. You are a shameless person,xa0nwhoever you are. This right here is every desi livingxa0room talkingxa0nabout politics. Okay? Right now,nyou have Indian Andy Garcia beefing with Indian Santa Claus.n""Youre a shameful man!"" While Indian Nancy Gracexa0nmoderates the debate. And while theyre all shoutingxa0nat each other, theres just some random unclenreading his Kindle. Hes just like, ""Kashmir. This argument is never gonna end.nI might as well get some reading done."" Now, you have to understand  Indiaxa0nand Pakistan, Kashmir is a loyalty test. ""Hey, how Pakistani are you? How Indian are you?""xa0 Right, and this test is comingxa0nat an incredibly critical moment in Indian politics. Good evening.xa0nOur top story on the 23rd of May, we will know who will mnthe next government of India. More than 900 million peoplexa0nwill cast their votes. [man]nIts the biggest electoral show on Earth. And this time, its all about this man, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In less than a month, India will be holdingxa0ntheir general election, and everyone is talking about whetherxa0nthe current Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be able to stay in power. But this election is about more than that. Since Modi came to power,xa0nIndia has grown more hostilexa0 to minority groups.nAmong a vocal minority, theres been a resurgencenin religious nationalism, specifically Hindu nationalism,nthe idea that India is a Hindu nation. Which completely goes against secularism, which is enshrinednin the Indian constitution. And I know what youre thinking, ""Of course Hasan Minhajnwould say that about Mother India. After all, we all know hes a spy... - Pakistan.""n-[thunder crashes] In many ways, this electionxa0nis about what it means to be Indian. And no, you cant just marry into it. India... is the largestxa0democracy on Earth. It has around 900 million eligible voters, and you know if that many peoplexa0nvoted in America, it would still come downnto 38 people in Florida. India has 29 states in seven territories, 22 official languagesxa0nand every major religion. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains,xa0nJews, Buddhists and overly optimisticxa0nChristian missionaries. Who are like, ""Hey, you never know."" Even within Hinduism,nthere are thousands of castes, which is the social classnthat youre born into. All of this makes Indiaxa0onenof the most diverse places on Earth. And yet, the only thingxa0nAmericans know about India is henna tattoos,xa0nGwen Stefanis bindi phase and goat yoga. [woman] So on your breath in,njust open to the heart space. Lift the tailbone,nshift your gaze ward... -Like this?n-and maybe kiss your goat.xa0[laughs] All of that diversity of Indiancant be captured in a simple two party system. India has a parliamentary system,xa0nwhich is the nerdiest thingxa0 that we took from the British.  last electionxa0nhad over 8,000 candidates and roughly 6 political parties. Usually to take power,xa0nparties have to team up and m coalitions to get a majority. So coalitions can team up to win,nlike LeBron with the Heat, or they can team up and lose,nlike LeBron with the Lakers. For the last 30 years, its been nearly impossiblexa0nto govern without a coalition. But in 201, the impossible happened. A historic win xa0Narendra Modinand the BJP party.  BJP has won enough seatsxa0n a majority and many, many more. No single party has won a majorityxa0nin India since 198. Modi led the BJP, a right-wingnnationalist party, to axa0landslide win. Modis victory was built onnhis rags-to-riches story, charisma and economic promisesn the poorest in India. [man] He promised to generate jobsxa0n the roughly 12 million young Indians who enter the workce each year. We want small workplacesnin factories to spread. In every village, street and neighborhood, we should see the impact of employment. But really, his campaign could be summed upxa0nin one phrase. India first. India first. India first. India first. [speaks eign language] India first! Its like he was getting readyn an audition. Hes like, ""India first.xa0nGod damn it. Come on. Give me some more Pitino.nIndia first! India first! Now, why does that sound so familiar? America first. America first. America first. Again, Im  America First. Trump even name-checked Modi in 2016. What Im about to show you guysnis 100% real. This is a real campaign ad,nand we did not edit this in any way. I look ward to working withnPrime Minister Modi. [speaks eign language] [sitar  playing] We love the Hindus. We love India. Im Donald Trump,nand I approve this message. I love the way Trump says, "" Hindus."" Its like he doesnt know what they are,nbut definitely thinks they have powers. We love India. We love the Hindus! Come on, I can imagine an Indian uncle at home watching thisxa0non Zee TV like, ""My man. Thats what Im talking about. My man!""xa0 Now throughout the upcoming election,xa0 youre gonna hear a lot of people ncomparing Modi to Trump, and I get why.xa0 y both dislike the press, they bothxa0nuse Twitter to attack their rivals. yre both strongmen with rabid fans, and they both greet peoplenin very bizarre ways. Now, you guys all knowxa0nTrumps handshake, right?  Trump yanks people like hes expectingxa0ncoins to come out of their mouth. And if Trumps a tugger, Modis axa0hugger. [audience clamoring, applauding] Oh! I love how Modi just holds his hand. Its so gentle. Hes just like...xa0 Tum Paas Aayexa0 [hums] Look at Donald. No, no. You can tell that Donalds mad. Hes pissed. Because that hug smooshedxa0the McDoublenin his pocket. Like, ""You got ketchup on my jacket."" -Yun Muskurayexa0n-""Look, stop it. I already told you. I love the Hindus. But not touching,nI dont even do that to Melania."" Now ultimately, comparing Modi to Trumpnis way too reductive. Modi is actually an incredibly charismaticnand astute politician. He gives speeches all the time. But he is the only Indian prime ministernto have never held a press conferencexa0 in his own country. That way, he can never be questionedxa0nabout his controversies. Its like posting on Instagram,nbut disabling comments. And Modi has a historyxa0nof saying a lot with silence. In 2002, when Modi was chief ministerxa0nof the state ofxa0Gujarat,xa0 he received international condemnationxa0n not speaking outxa0 or stopping violent riots. Now, Modi said his response was adequate, and a court agreed. But almost 2,000 peoplexa0nwere still killed. Ultimately, Modi followsxa0the Lil Waynexa0nrule of diplomacy. ""Real Gs move in silence like lasagna."" Now compare that to the man running against Modi,xa0nRahul Gandhi, aka, Indias Michael Bublé. Now, he has no relationxa0nto Mahatma Gandhi, but Rahul Gandhi is the presidentxa0nof the Indian National Congress Party, the BJPs main opposition.xa0nHes political royalty. His great-grandfather, grandmothernand father were all prime ministers, but apparently,ngreatness isnt hereditary.  BJP has called Rahul lazy, stupid,nentitled, even pappu. In response to the insults, last summernin Parliament, Rahul was like, ""This ends right here, right nowxa0nwith love from pappu."" -[speaking eign language]n-[shouting] Dont get... Modi is a man who will hug anybody. Putin, Erdoğan, MBS, even Mark Zuckerberg, and here Modi was like,xa0n""Boundaries, Rahul, please. Please, just dont make me call HR."" No one has turned down a hug that hardxa0nsince Seinfeld turned down Kesha. Im Kesha, I love you so much. -Oh, thanks.n-Can I give you a hug? -No, thanks. Yeah, no thanks.n-Please, a little one. -Oh, ho-ho-ho.n-[laughing] -[man] That was a nice woman.n-I dont know who that was. Now, the truth is the downfall of Congressnthat propelled the BJP to victoryxa0 started long bee Rahul Gandhi, which is why I wanted to talkxa0nto both parties about whatxa0happened. But BJP officials did not respondxa0nto any of our interview requests. I dont know why. y left me on read, you guys. But Shashi Tharoor, a member of the Congress Party,ndid agree to sit down with us. Hes also a candidatexa0nin this years elections. Im a member of parliament, second term at the lower housexa0nof the Indian Parliament. So, politically, who would you bexa0nif you we had to compare you to political figures in the United States?nAre you like an Elizabeth Warren? [laughs] Do you mean in terms of ideology? Because honestly, there isnt quitexa0nan equivalent, our systems are different. -Are you more like a Chuck Schumer?n-Slightly left of center,  somewhere between Schumernand Elizabeth Warren would about do it. Does Kamala Harris count? Okay, so youre more of a Kamala.xa0nOkay, all right. I think youre an Elizabeth. I just love the way he talks. He sounds like hes the voicexa0nof a wise moose in a Pixar movie. Hes just like, ""Hasan, my boy. Avoid the cave during monsoon season. Its quite treacherous."" And Im like, I dont know,xa0nthe moose has spoken. Shashi has been very outspoken about the rightward shiftxa0nof politics in India. In many ways, this coming electionxa0nis about a battle  the soul of India. Weve had a party in powern the last four and a half years, which in many ways, nhas represented a radical departure from some aspects of whatxa0nIndia has always been seen as being about.  India that you wantxa0nto see your kids grow up in is India the people like mexa0nspeak . An inclusive party that brings in peoplexa0nof all regions, all languages into a common platm,xa0nthats the India of the Congress Party. I know you must be thinking,n""Wow, that sounds like an incredible visionxa0n India.xa0  Congress Party sounds awesome."" But the Congress Party has been miredxa0nin numerousxa0corruption scandals. re are honestly too many to go throughnright now, but the 2G Scandal is a hall ofxa0famer. How about this then? $0 billion. Thats the ballpark figurexa0being putnon the scalexa0 of Indias worst ever corruption scandal. A mer telecoms ministerxa0is onexa0nof 1 individuals, along with three companies,nfacing a variety of bribery allegations in the sale of mobile phone licenses. Just to put that number in perspective,  that amount of money,xa0nAunt Becky from Full  could have gotten 80,000 kids into USC. This was a major scandal. Time magazine ranked it the second worst nabuse of power of all time, after Watergate. Its actually the second tattooxa0non Roger Stones back. Now, the people involvednended up being acquitted, but the Indian courtsnare a whole other episode.  Congress Party has been a cesspoolnof corruption. So I had to ask Shashi Tharoor about it. No party has a monopoly on virtue, and no partyxa0nhas a monopoly on corruption. Are you saying, like, in Indian politics,ncorruption is just everywhere, both parties sort of have it? In India,xa0increasingly,xa0nthere is that perception. To me, it feels likexa0ndescribing the way HPV is. You know how its like,xa0n""Hey, come on. Everybody has it."" [laughs] I certainly hope thats not true. Okay. Its not just corruption charges that plaguenboth major political parties in India. As crazy as it sounds, people in both parties have faced murdernand other serious charges, including the wise old moose. You called into question on Twitterxa0nthe motivation of the Delhi police in pursuing you, first on the questionxa0nof whether you murdered your wife and now whether you were involvedxa0nin pushing her towards suicide. re isnt a shred of truth in eithernthe charge that there was any foul play or any crime was involvedxa0in the tragicxa0nand premature death of my wife. God, its so hardxa0nto keep the candidates straight in India. Whats their economic policy?nWhat about education? What degree of murderxa0nhave they been charged with? Ive got a charge that has been, you know, bandied about against me  some years,nand I find this utterly preposterous that there is no sensenof any proportion or reasonableness. It feels like every single politician has some sort of relationxa0nto either a murder charge or killing. Even Suge Knight would lookxa0nat Indian politicians and be like, ""Yo, these people are fucking nuts."" In any democracy,nvoters get the leaders they deserve, so youve got to essentially leave itnto the wisdom of the votersxa0 to reject people who have credible chargesnand accusations against them. Great advice, Shashi. If the 201 election was a referendumxa0non the Congress Partys massive failures, the 2019 election is a referendumxa0non Modis economic promises. He promised to put Indians to work, but unemploymentxa0nis the highest its been in  years. We actually dont even know how bad it is because Modis governmentxa0nhas been accusedxa0 of hiding unemployment data, which is like advertising a subletnon Craigslist with no pictures. You know that shit is shady. Youre like, ""Let me see some pics.""nyre like, ""Trust me.  place is great."" n theres Modisxa0nsignature economic policy,  demonetization, an attemptxa0nto get dark money out of circulation. It sounds like a good idea, but it ended up being a massive failure. Even the Reserve Bank of Indianwas against it, but Modi did it anyway. Now, I know a lot of you are thinking,n""But, Hasan, at least he tried."" And lets be real, Indians... when have we ever given an A  eft? Really? You think I could go up to my dad,n""Hey, Abbu,xa0I got a participation trophy."" Im sleeping outside  an A minus.nCome on, man.  worst partxa0nof the demonetization thing is that it hurt poor people the hardest,nespecially farmers, who account  two-thirdsxa0nof the population. Under Modi,nmany farmers have financially suffered. [woman] Protesters say farm incomesxa0nhave plunged as produce prices have failed to keep pacenwith the soaring costs of key supplies. Since this deceptive government has come, we farmers are worse off,nwere struggling  work and food. [man translating] I got very little money nwhen I went to sell my rice crop. How will I earn? Were making a loss. Why is Larry the Cable Guy doing voice-over n an Indian economic crisis? [imitating Larry the Cable Guy]n""How will I grow my rice? In my Chevy Silverado."" [normal voice] But it goes beyondnModis failed economic policies.  BJP is currently trying to stripxa0almost four millionnmostly Muslim immigrants of their rightxa0to votenin the state of Assam. If they get away with it,xa0nit will be the single largest voter disenfranchisementnin recorded history. But of course,nHasan Minhaj, the Pakistani agent... [shouts] would come to the defensexa0nof Muslim immigrants and to that, I say, ""How could I be a Pakistani agentxa0nwhen Im actually being paid by Qatar?"" [thunder crashes] Qatar is paying me oh-so well. All of these things have put Modi on very shaky ground goingxa0ninto the 2019 elections. That was untilxa0the conflictnin Kashmir reignited.  ruling party,xa0Janata Partynand other political parties are fine tuning election strategies. Sources suggest that it will benthe airstrike aftermath and the nationalist fervor around it. that will m the bulwarknof election campaigning  the BJP.  nuclear showdown could not have comenat a better time  Modi, who is doing everything he cannto project strength in the most Indian way possible. This is a new India! This is an Indiaxa0nthat will return the damage done by terrorists with interest! In classic Indian fashion, Modi had to mix revenge and finance. We will retaliate with 6% interest! And it will compound to 9%! n we will refinance. And theyre like...xa0n[speaks eign language] Modi is appealing to his basenwith his ""India First"" agenda. And at the same time, hes given new lifexa0nto the Hindu nationalist movementxa0 because of his deep ties to the RSS,na right-wing organization thats the ideological backbonexa0nof the BJP. [man] y arexa0disciplined and determined,nand their numbers are growing fast. y are the RSS, a network of volunteersnwho are playing a critical role in the election campaign of Narendra Modi. Some fear that the RSS ultimate goal is to ce India to become less secular,nmore religiously Hindu, spreading its message throughxa0nits daily meetings,  which critics called militaristic, accusations the RSS rejects. This is how Modis gonna get elected? Donatellos just gonna hit a piñata? Hes just like,xa0n""This broom is a lightsaber."" Look at him, hes just like,xa0n""Im done with cardio  the day."" [muttering] Oh, boy. Extremism, you burn so many calories. Modi isnt loosely affiliatedxa0nwith the RSS. For decades,xa0nhes been a card carrying member. He spent years working  the RSS,nand hes pretty open about it. I stayed connected to RSSxa0since childhood.  traditions and the discipline,xa0nthe hard-working nature I have, RSS had a huge role to play in that.xa0 Modi being connected to the RSSxa0nshould be concerning. Its easy to laughxa0nat the cosplay wing of the RSS, but they have some concerning beliefs. y have long relied on a book,nand I swear this is the real title. Its called Bunch of Thoughts. Okay, that doesnt sound likenthe manifesto of a radical movement. It sounds like the Medium postxa0nyou write after a divorce. Just like, ""I dont know man,xa0nCarol left me. Here are a bunch of thoughts.nIts a short -minute read. Just leave me a comment."" yve recently disavowed parts of it,nand I know why. It gets pretty Mein Kampfy in a few parts. Like when it saysxa0nthere are three major internal threats, the Muslims, the Christiansxa0nand the Communists. Once again, you guys, Muslims. Were number one, baby. Now, the RSS is extreme. yve been banned in Indiaxa0several timesn stoking violence.  toll of religious extremism is something India has paid nin the past. A Hindu nationalist nassassinated Mahatma Gandhi. Now I know people are like, ""Of course,nHasan Minhaj, the spy from Qatar, is trying to divide India once again."" But how could that be possiblenwhen Im already being paid by Iran? [thunder crashes] Now, you know whyxa0nthe Saudis dont like me. Hindu nationalists have been instigatingxa0na culture of intimidation and violence towards a lot of religious minority groupsnthroughout India. [woman] Modis most extremexa0nationalistxa0nsupporters have routinely taken to the streets using violencexa0nand intimidation to press their claim  a purely Hindu India. You see this trend throughout the country, but especially in the northern statenof Uttar Pradesh which will be very importantnin the election.xa0 UP is the most populous state in Indiaxa0nwith a bigger populationxa0than Brazil. Yeah, and it has major electoral clout. Modi is heavily pushingnhis nationalist agenda there, and hes doing it through one of Indiasxa0nmost hardcorexa0political figures, a monk named Yogi Adityanath. Two years ago, Modi made himxa0nChief Minister of UPxa0 and some believed he could succeedxa0nModi as prime minister,xa0 which is very scaryxa0nbecause hes a monk with a gun. If you dont have to commit crimes, why do you have a revolvernworth 100,000 rupees? Why do you have riflesxa0nworth 80,000 rupees? Yes, I have these. As a monk, my training is in both disciplinexa0nand in weapons. Discipline and weapons. Hes like, ""I like to meditate,nbut I also like to be strapped."" If youre a little confused,xa0nI understand why. This is an interview shownjust shot on Judge Judys set, and then apparently over here,xa0nthey just shoot Dancing with the Stars. Now remember, this is the guyxa0nwho the BJP is counting on  to deliver votes, and he hasnsystematically used fear of minorities as a cultural wedge issue. Under Yogi Adityanath, nthe state has changed the namesxa0 of places throughout the UPnfrom Muslim names to Hindu names. And it isnt just Muslims, violence against all minoritiesnhas gone up. Take  examplexa0the phenomenon knownxa0nas cow lynchings. Thousands of peoplexa0have takennto the streets across India to protest against rising attacksxa0non Muslims and Dalits by vigilante cow protection groups. Cows are a holy animal in Hinduism,nand vigilantes want to protect cows, are targeting Muslimsnand a minority group called Dalits. [man] Religious minoritiesxa0nhave traditionally been free to farm and trade in cows, but theres beenxa0na crackdown by right-wing politicians.  tough new stancexa0nhas not only fueled attacks on Muslims, but also on lower-caste Hindu Dalits. re were no reported lynchings in 2013, but since then, 6 peoplexa0have been killednand 20 injured in cow-related violence. Its gotten so bad,xa0Dalits are routinelyxa0nvictimized by the lynchings. And  New Yorker reported that ncommunal violence has jumped 28% during Modis rule. This patternxa0nof growing religious nationalism, violence, disregard  institutions,nrampant misinmation, weak and corrupt opposition, were seeing all of this around the globe. Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Spain, Brazil,xa0nthe Philippines and now India. Democracies are backsliding,nand its not just me saying this. Indians feel that something is different. What is at stake is nothing shortnof the future of this country. Its not an ordinary election. If 1977 was about deciding whetherxa0nIndia will remain democratic or not, this election is about deciding whethernIndia will remain India or not. Something much deeper is at stake here. Something deeper is at stake. Will India remain India or not? Will India define itself through inclusionnor exclusion? As the election heats up, its much easier  candidatesxa0nto exploit the conflict in Kashmir  political gain than to address the economyxa0and deepeningxa0ndivisions within the country. But that doesnt make sense. We dont need the threatxa0nof nuclear warfare to flex nationalism. Thats why we have cricket. We know this. Come on. We already know this, you guys. That India-Pakistan matchxa0nis nuclear warfare. And look, you gotta understand  me.nI gotta be honest with you. Ive always felt uncomtable cause I have Indianxa0nand Pakistani friends,xa0 and Ill be on both sides,nand Ill just feel like Im in the middle. Ill be at one friends house,xa0n""India, India!"" Ill be at the Pakistani-- ""Pakistansxa0nin the-- [speaksxa0eign language] [hums]  Pakistan! xa0""India won!"" ""Pakistan won."" ""No, India won."" ""No, Pakistan won.""xa0nIm like, ""No, dude, the British won."" And when it comes to this election, India shouldnt allow itselfxa0nto be divided again. But what do I know? se are just a bunch of thoughts."
25,0,"As you can tell, this is stilln : Quarantine Edition. Now look. When I first heard we werengoing into lockdown, I panicked. I ran to the store, I hoardedntoilet paper, Purell, and batteries. So many batteries. I really thought the apocalypsenwould involve more flashlights. But some people had a different idea. Its not water, its not canned goods, its not toilet paper, its marijuana. “Panic buying at cannabisndispensaries. Look at the long line.” “Some long lines last night.” “Lines out the door here as well.” I just decided to stock upnon the weed, just in casenthe guys closed down. You gotta prepare  the worst. I smoke so much pot, the Zig Zag Mannhas a tattoo of me on his arm. Wait... is that Joe Biden? Only he would say “Zig Zag man.” Now, as lockdowns spread in March,npot use hit record highs. And a lot of people are using marijuananto get through this difficult time. Which is why tonightnIm talking about weed. And I know, this isntnthe most pressing issue, but I want to talk about it  the samenreason a lot of people want to smoke it: we all need a break. And yes, I know, I have Big Narc Energy. I dont do drugs, so Im going to try tonnot embarrass myself talking about them. Luckily, the bar is pretty low. We call this magic bus the canna-bus. Get it? Woah! Hundreds of people smoking weed. Skunk!  devils lettuce!nRighteous bush! Everybody needs a beautiful hand-blown bong. Rolling up a doobie. Does anyone still call it a doobie? And the groups in our school was likenthe “swelts” and the “creamies,” and the “dirties,” and the “jocks.” And the “dirties”nwere the ones who did pot. Wait, the “creamies” and the “dirties?” Megyns like, “You guys remember high school. Prom, chem, race wars.” And the black woman in the front row is just like, “Okay,nthis took a left turn, Megyn.” Now weed is still federally illegal. But right now, there are 31 states allowingndispensaries to stay open even as the country shuts down, with many calling themn“essential businesses.” So, according to the government, weed is illegal, but also necessary. Its the waterboarding of drugs. Most Americans actually already live in a statenthat allows weed in some m, which means the legal weed industrynis exploding. Bee the coronavirus, estimates said itd be worthnup to $19 billion this year and $30 billion by 2023. With that much money,nyou could buy the Mets 13 times or buy enough weednto make baseball entertaining. Now look, if youre a baseball fan,nI truly dont give a fuck.  only exciting thing thatsnever happened in baseball was when Randy Johnson pitched the ballnand a bird exploded. Thats it. If they dont kill a bird every game,nIm not interested. Were obviously way past the ideanof if we should legalize weed. It is here. But we havent talked enoughnabout how to legalize it. Because we are messing it up. Legal marijuana is rigged. And its about to get worse. Now to be fair, our weed lawsnhave always been messed up. We dont have time  the full history,nbut, TLDR, its pretty racist. It started in the 1930s, when government officials said stuff like, “Reefer makes darkies think theyre as good as white men.” Obviously, dude went to high schoolnwith Megyn. y were both were voted “most likely to insistnthe Civil War was about states rights.” n Nixon started the war on drugs,nand shit got even more racist. Black communities were targeted,nand today, black people make up justn13% of America but 0% of peoplenimprisoned  drug crimes. So you would think legalization should benefitnminority communities the most. But its actually benefitingnpeople like this. Guess what?nWere selling legal weed. Do I call it a pot storenor a marijuana store? You can call it whatever you want.nI call it the future. res nonbars on the windows. res nonguy with a gun at the front. I want to convertnevery Chardonnay mom to replace Chardonnay with pot. Ugh. He says “Chardonnay moms” like henjust cleared it from his browser history. This is Adam Bierman, co-founder of the weed company MedMen. Now youve probably heard of them. And this is Biermans business philosophy. Your song is alwaysnLose Yourself. That is thensoundtrack to my life. res another Eminem... I dont know, how personalnare we going to get?  last scene in 8 Mile... He starts the battle, and he starts itnwith, you know, something like, “I am white, I do livenin a trailer park with my mom.” Right. And by the timenhe was done. the guy had nothing to say. In more and more instancesnI want to say, “Yeah, I amnall those things.” Hes actually none of those things. This is true. He grew up in San Diego. He went to USC. And his favorite TV show is  West Wing. Bro, you know what I realized? Youre not 8 Mile, youre fucking Lady Bird. And if I have to stand here and listen to you pretend to be from Detroit any longer, Im going to go chug a gallon of their water. Bierman is still on the board at MedMen, but he recently stepped down as CEO,nand you might be wondering why. It could be because he paid himself millionsnbee the company was profitable? Or because their stock tanked, or because he allegedly called an L.A. City councilman a “midget Negro.” But that cant be it. I mean, who would callna governing official that name? Thats insane. Now I have to go homenand explain to my Latina wife and mynSpanish-speaking kids why Im beingncalled a racist at work, right? Im surprised he didnt go with, “I cant be racist.nMy wife and kids are midget negros.” Now, he denies he ever said that. But Bierman actually isnt the worstnperson to profit off legal weed. With me now mer Speaker of the nJohn Boehner. Now youre all in on cannabis. Im all in. This is the time to go all innon cannabis. Cannabis is here to stay. And this industrynis only getting bigger. As I said, Im all in on cannabis.  most shocking part of thisnisnt that John Boehner likes weed. Its that John Boehnerntalks like a manga character. Hes like, “Im John Boehner,nand Im all in on cannabis. Now lets talk  the next ten episodes,nthen well finally fight.” That clip was from an online seminarn weed investors that Boehner hosted. Hes on the board of a companyncalled Acreage Holdings, which means hes in line to make millionsnoff of legal marijuana. Even though  years Boehner foughtnto keep it illegal. Which may sound super hypocritical... But dont worry.nBoehners got an airtight defense. Just listen to whatnNPR Austin Powers asks him. When you were a politician, you said you were unalterablynopposed to legalization. One of the things I wanted to ask younwas what harm has been done by the fact thatnwe didnt legalize it back then? Oh I dont know theresnany harm thats been done. re was people getting arrested,npeople getting thrown in jail. Like, I mean,nthat counts, doesnt it? Well yeah, but that was underna different set of rules, at a different time. “A different time?” Dude, you left office five years ago. You cant do the “different time” thing. Thats  when you take Grandpanto P.F. Changs. Like, “Hey, were really sorry he callednthe waitress a ‘dumpling geisha.’ Hes from a different time.” Acreage is one of the biggestnweed companies in America. And bee the pandemic,nit was in 19 states and expanding fast. Part of that is demand, but another partnis that states are building systems that are good  giant weed companiesnand bad  almost everyone else. And one of the main ways they do thatnis through licenses. In the weed business,nyou need a license to literally do anything. And a lot of states make it easiern big business to get licensed. Take Calinia, Americas sideburn. After they legalizednrecreational weed in 2016, policymakers wanted to putna one-acre limit on licensesn weed farmers until 2023, to help small farmers and the little guynrein in big companies. But then, Big Marijuana spent $1.6 millionnlobbying, and things changed. Small pot farmersnin Calinia say the statenis not standing by its promisento protect them. re are people who are stacking tens to close ton100 one-acre cultivation permits. “We found one companyngot 200 permits, enoughnto grow on 6 acres.” Yeah, of course you found them.ny grew a drug est. Big companies were supposed to be limited. But some have stackednhundreds of licenses, which has small farmersnstruggling to keep up. “New industrial-scale rivals haveneconomies of scale that lower their costs. So how can a small legal grower like Swaminpossibly compete? Branding. Swami Chaitanyanannounces his presence... to Ganesh, Hindu god of,namong other things, good luck, who presides over the crop Swami growsnto produce Swami Select, his patented marijuana brand.” Aw, come on.nIndian culture isnt  selling weed. Its  selling Coldplay. But okay, Ill bite. Who is this Swami? “Swami, in prior lifenWilliam Winans, a 60s Wesleyan grad, filmmaker, San Francisco hippie,nwho spent ten years in India--” Whoa, wait, white people are pretendingnto be Indian to sell drugs? Dude, honestly, Im proud. We got our own Rachel Dolezal. Raj Dolezal. But as bad as Calinia isn small weed businesses, theres a state thats even worse. Florida, Americas uvula. In Florida, this is how they describenthe legal weed industry. Its a cartel. Its a cartel of license holders. y created a cartel essentially. You havenan industry allowing  businessesnto operate like cartels. I feel like every business in Floridanis a cartel. Pottery Barn? Cartel.nBabyGap? Cartel. Curves Fitness? Cartel. Dude, admit it, Pablo had some thickums. Thats the other thingnthat he hid from the DEA, that booty. Florida legalized medical marijuananin 2016 under then-governor Rick Scott. But the state gives out very fewnoperating licenses, which makes thingsncutthroat and expensive. One license in Florida sold  $ million. And to even qualify  a license, businesses have to havenvertical integration, which means you controlnthe entire process. That means if youre in Florida,nyoure in charge of setting up a farm, growing and harvesting the weed,nprocessing the weed, distributing the weed, and operatingnthe stores that sell the weed. And some of you are thinking,n“Whatever, bro. Thats just Capitalism 101. Just dont smoke my weed, play my Xbox,nor eat my Funyun casserole.” But this isnt just capitalismnand the invisible hand. This is a demented thumb saying, “If youncant afd to do every single step, you cant even play the game.” Youre either flush with cash,nor youre out. So if youre thinking,n“Hey, me and my bros from high school were going to go Miami. Were gonna set up a dispensarynand make money.” No, youre not. Five companies now own 6%nof Floridas weed business. yre hogging all the weed.nKind of like you, Caleb. Caleb, pass that shit. Who raised you? Ten other states also require verticalnintegration  medical marijuana. Across the country, big companiesnwith major capital run the table, because they can vertically integratenand snag licenses in multiple states. Just look atnBoehners company, Acreage. Right? yre one of the largest vertically integrated companies in the U.S. And as of last year, they held licensesnin more states than any other company. Which made them super valuable. Canopy Growth will acquire a marijuana growing operation called Acreage Holdings, and they will paynclose to $ billion  it. Close to $ billion. Yeah. Whoa. I mean, how much pot do they grow? Why does itnfeel like every day Stu Varney is blown awaynby a different number. Hes like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa,n$ billion? Im still reelingnfrom 37 yesterday.” Now the deal has already madenAcreage shareholders like Boehner $300 million. And this isnwhat the industry is now: a few multi-state operators,nwith lots of licenses in lots of states, raking it in. And its hard to not notice a pattern. When you look aroundnthe cannabis industry as an African-American woman,nwhat do you see?  men.  men, white men, white men. Hold on. Thats not fair to John Boehner. Hes more of a “burnt sienna.” Im serious, we did this: We went on the Benjamin Moorencolor match app, and he is somewhere betweenna “Cottage Red” and a “Rustic Brick.” But shes right. According to one survey,nout of all legal marijuana businesses, 81% are white-owned. Sorry, Swami-owned. And % are black-owned. And theres a reason  that.  war on drugs never ended. Today, white and black people use weednat roughly the same rate, but black people are almost four timesnmore likely to get arrested  it. In Montana, theyre almost ten timesnmore likely to get arrested. Which is really badn the one black dude in Montana. Clarence, if youre watching this,nbe careful. Even after youve done your time,nold drug charges can haunt you. “Whats been the impact of getting caught upnin a criminal justice system on those charges at that age?” Ah... You will never... get a job. Youll never be able to live the waynyou want to live. Your background is alwaysngoing to come back. If you have a drug record,nit can be almost impossible to get a job even in the weed business. Do you understand?nThat means employers are like, “Oh, you sold weed? Sorry, were professionals herenat DabKingzLyfe.com.” Some states are trying to fix thatnthrough social equity programs, which help people hurt by the war on drugsnbreak into the industry. But they arent always effective.nMassachusetts started one three years ago. Now guess how many black-ownednretail dispensaries they have right now? One. In the whole state! So I had to sit down with the owners, back when I was stillnallowed to sit down with people So, guys, tell me,nwhere are we sitting right now? We are in Pure Oasis, soon to be Bostons first recreational dispensary.  first economic empowermentnowned dispensary in Massachusetts and also the first minority-ownedncannabis dispensary on the East Coast. So when this place opens, this will benthe very first time pot is sold in Boston. Thats so amazing. Man, I cant waitn all those Boston weed strains. “Purple Harvard.” “Jamaican Affleck.” “Strawberry Busing Riot.” se are the owners of Pure Oasis, Kobie and Kevin. And I wanted to ask them how they feel about equity programs. Would you say equity programsnare effective? -Absolutely.n-Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think the success ofnan equity program hinges upon other things, but I think by and large, if there was no equity program, Kobie and I may notnbe sitting bee you today. Has the execution of the equity programsnmatched their intent? -No.n-I would agree with “no.” What this needs in order  peoplento be successful are a list of wraparound services. -Access to capital, legal, tax help.n-Taxes, technical assistance. So  this to be fair,nit has to provide reach-around services. Wraparound services. It provides equity capital, you knowntechnical services... -Yeah.n-Exactly. ...you know, pleasure, joy,na release that feels good. -No, no, no, wraparound.n-Wraparound. Different. Wrap-around, reach-around... You say, “Tomato,”nI say, “Pleasure that tomahto.” Good equity programs do all those things,nplus they help people get licenses.  program in Massachusettsnactually helped Kobie and Kevin move up the list and get theirs faster. But since everyone wants a license, once you have one,nyou can become a target  big investors. What did the out-of-state investorsnreally want from you? y wanted control of our company. But, really. What does that mean? y wanted to loan us moneynto really build the operation, and in a nutshell, the conversationsn us felt very predatory. Almost like loan shark-y. This is our company. When they walked into the room,nthey acknowledged that it was our company. But as the night progressed,nit became clear that they wanted to take our companynand make us employees. That was insulting. I dont see whats so offensive here.nCannabis is a crop, okay? se VCs have come in and asked you to share crop.  dudes are coming up to twonblack men and saying, “Hey, share crop.” And then the VCs could helpnstructure the company in a new way. Itd be a kind of likena Reconstruction era. I dont know. This just seems like a simple,nblack and white issue to me. Big companies use equity programsnto get control of more licenses. This is a huge loophole, and Big Marijuananis walking right through. Last year,na company called Harvest of Ohio claimed a black womannwas their majority owner when their CEO was actually a white dude named Steve . That name is whiter than a Nalgenenclipped onto a carry-on with a carabiner. Have you ever seenna black person own this? Now, Harvest saysnthey didnt do anything wrong. But this begs the question, “Is it worth it?” This is a racial and economic issue. If were just gonna make the rich richer, freeze out small businessnand the little guy, and ignore victims of the war on drugs, should we legalize weed at all? This isnt a hypothetical question.nLast year, New York delayed legalization in part becausenit didnt do enough  racial justice. And Ohio had a super-bizarre fightnabout legalization. In 201, a group called Responsible Ohionstarted a legalization campaign with one surprising spokesman. Im Nick Lachey. Ohio is my home, and I care very deeplynabout the people here. Wait. Nick Lachey?  co-host of Love Is Blind?  mer lead singer of 98°? You guys remember 98°.n clearance rack version of *NSYNC. If the weed business gets any whiter, every weed menunwill start including shakshuka. Now Nick Lachey wasnt justnpromoting legalization out of the goodnessnof his 98° heart. He had another motive. “Critics argue the ad fails tonmention Lacheys stake as an investor.” “ constitutional amendmentnwould give exclusive rights to all of the marijuanangrown and sold at 1,100 storesnin the Buckeye State at 1,100 storesnin the Buckeye Statento just ten groups. to just ten groups. One is Lacheys.” Lachey wanted a system riggedn just ten growers, including himself. That is so messed up.nThis is what this show has come to. When we first started, I was getting into beefsnwith international dictators. Now Im like, “We must stopnthe lead singer of 98°.” Lachey actually wasntnthe only celeb involved. “TV and  star Nick Lachey,nNFL player Frostee Rucker, fashion designer Nanette Lepore, and even President William Taftsngreat-great-grandnephews have financial stakes in the game.” This is President William Howard Taftsngreat-great-grandnephew Dudley Taft. This is a real person. He looks like a guy who plays guitar in a band named after himself. Because he fucking does.  Imma take my cellphone   And throw it in a deep hole   Its gonna pollute your soul   Give me a simple life   Yeah!  This is what all rock n rollnsounds like to me. Just a bearded rednecknshouting like a Michigan protestor. You hear Metallica,nI hear, “Open the Foot Locker, man!” Now the people of Ohionrealized what was happening and voted downnthe Lachey-Taft drug cartel. Let me make something clear.nIm not saying legalization is bad. Smoke weed. Hotbox your face mask. But support  legalizationnshouldnt be automatic. We need to look into how it worksnand who it works . Even though sales are up in some places,nCOVID is still hurting the industry, especially small businesses. I caught up with Kobie and Kevin to seenhow theyre doing right now with all this. y had to shut down,nthey had to lay off their employees, and because weed is still federallynillegal, they cant get any federal loans. Now luckily, they saynthey have enough cash  now, but they said other small businessesnlike theirs might not survive. This is what pisses me off the most. This is yet another industry where a small group of people at the topnhoard all the profits and the little guy has no chance. Bee COVID, twelve more states were planning to vote on somenm of legalization this year. Now a lot of them have put those plans onnhold, which I think could be a good thing. It gives us a chance to step back and look at whatnthese laws are really doing. Because as a Rustic Brick once said... This is the timento go all in on cannabis. But only if all of us get to."
26,0,"We all know the coronavirusnhas hit older Americans the hardest. Except  Jeff Goldblum. Hes stillnout here dressing like hes in BTS. But COVID-19 is also hitting young peoplenin a major way. Across America,nlife is changing rapidly. Hundreds of schools and collegesnare closing nationwide. Stand, Princeton, Harvard.nA lot of schools. And it seems like,nthe number is growing by the day. “At Kent State University, todaynmany students moved out unexpectedly.” -What are you taking with you?n-Everything. Millions of students home early. I know. Ive got one herenwhos behind the camera this morning. A 19-year-old from BU. Why do I feelnlike I should call the FBI? “Ive got a 19-year-oldnstudent back here. Taut, supple, loves hockey.” Colleges were some of the first placesnto shut down because of corona. In an instant,nchildhood bedrooms became dorms, moms became cafeteria workers, and Econ 101 looked liken Brady Bunch fucked Don Lemons show. By the way,nI love how celebrities are also like, “Aww, you didnt get a graduation? Let me just FaceTime younfrom my bedroom.” So keep your eyes on the ball. res always the haves and thenhave nots in a capitalistic society. Trust me, as a dudenwho only got a 1310 on the SAT and became a stand up comedian,ntheres no shame in living at home. Okay, look. y didnt ask me to benin the “Imagine” video, so I had to takenwhat I could get. Its no secret,nstudents arent loving classes online. And not just because one teacherngot to close his porn tabs. Its a shame he had to resign. He loved his job so much,nhe literally jerked off to it. Schools going online also meant that students werent gettingnwhat theyd paid . A lot of them were pissed. Students are suing two majornuniversities in New England. “Demanding repaymentn their tuition, and their room and board.” Its just kind of wild to thinknthat we had to pay $,000  basically the same thingnyou could find on Coursera or edX. Holy shit, $,000n a glorified MasterClass? Thats enough to take Screenwriting with Aaron Sorkin and buy the mountain of cocainenhe used to write A Few Good Men. So far, students around the country havenfiled at least 100 lawsuits  refunds.  dean at NYU Tisch sent an emailnsaying thered be no refunds  tuition and then attached this very real video.  Thats me in the corner   Thats me in the spotlightnLosing my religion  Someone cing you to listen to R.E.M. isnalready one of the worst parts of college. You just dont expect it to be your dean. Also, its $8,000 a year to go to Tisch. And shes like, “Sorry you cant get yournmoney back, heres a free Zumba class.” res actually one big reason whynschools dont want to give out refunds. “ American Council on Education now projects nationwide enrollment in the fall will be down 1%  a revenue loss, conservatively, of $23 billion.” $23 billion. That is so much moneynthey could have used to not pay college athletes.  truth is, some schoolsnarent going to make it through COVID. One estimate says 3nuniversities across the country may have to closenin the next six years.  University of Akronnis closing six of its eleven colleges. And  the schools that are staying open,nrules are all over the place.  Cal State system announcednthat classes will only be online. And UNCnand Notre Dame are going to open early, but then end the semester by Thanksgiving. Look... no one has a clue what collegenis going to look like next year. So if youre about to go to college,nor youre in college, or if youre a parent, youre probably wondering... Is college still worth it? Because with student debtncrushing so many people, its important to know: what are younreally getting  your money? This debate isnt new, by the way. Pre-COVID, lots of people were questioningnthe value of college. Especially rich assholes. -res no need even to have ancollege degree at all.n- Oh, okay. Dont spend, you know, $200,000non a college degree and wastenfour years of your life. Colleges, theyre like as corruptnas the Catholic Church was 00 years ago. Hes right, everyone knows collegesnce professors to remain celibate and burn heretics alive. Look,nI get that a lot of people feel that way. But growing up most of us were told, “Hey, if you get into the right college, itsnyour golden ticket.” I believed that. Its why these videos are a thing. I just got into Harvard. Oh my god, I got in! -Yeah, baby!n-Oh my god. To all my Asian parents watching at home: the thing those parents were doingnis something called “being proud.” I know. Its stupid. So clearly a lot of peoplenstill think college is worth it. You know the intangibles: social skills, critical thinking, and the chance to smoke weed out ofnyour roommates sleep apnea machine. But there are real factsnin favor of college: over their careers,nwomen with a college degree earn about $0,000 morenthan high school grads. For men, its $660,000 more. For low-income students, a college degree may be thensingle best engine  social mobility. If you grow up poornand graduate from college, you have a 90% chancenof getting out of poverty. So, getting a degreenis kind of like being Tom Hanks kid. Your chances of ending up okaynare very high but its not 100%. Its ya boy Chet and Incoming straight from the Golden Globes, yknow what Im saying? My father Tom Hanks presentingnan award soon ward come. Big up, tune in. By Golden Globes standards, this actually counts as diversity. So, the benefits of a college degreenare pretty obvious. But what you may not realize, is that the downside of not havingna degree is getting worse. In the 90s, jobs that paid at least $3,000 were held by college gradsn0% of the time. Today, its %. But thats mainly because in the 90s most people had a jobnbeing in Guns N Roses. But here is the most shocking fact. Americans are killing themselvesnby drinking, by accidentally overdosing,nby overeating, or more quickly and morenstraightwardly, by committing suicide. Deaths of despair have risen in paralleln men and women.  key distinction herenis not between men and women, but rather between thosenwith and without a college degree. That is so depressing. Even when you hear itnfrom a Hogwarts professor. Working-class lifenis more grueling than ever. Look at the number of white peoplenwho died from deaths of despair. This is how many had a college degree. And this is how many who didnt. That should be on every brochure by the way. Just like, “Chico State,ngo here, or die of unnatural causes.” Do you see whats happening here? College used to be aspirational,nit was your shot at a better life. But these days, youre not really rewardedn getting a degree. Its kind of expected. But you are definitely penalizedn not getting one. So when it comes to going to college,nits an unenthusiastic yes. Like voting  Joe Biden. It sucks, but youre probably gonna do itnif you want a future. And whether or not colleges know this,nthey have you by the balls. Which means they can twist and squeeze. Check this out: college tuition has morenthan doubled over the past 30 years. And on top of that, tuition and feesnmake up only 8% of total costs students actuallynpay to attend those schools. Obviously, we all knowncollege is expensive. But what you might not knownis that the product is getting worse. Just look at whats happeningnto tenured professors. Tenure is when a university givesna professor lifelong job security to do research and teach. yre well-paid, killer benefits. Its the Delta Gold Medallion statusnof academia. Good professors are necessary. Without them, college is justnramen noodles and a few pregnancy scares. But tenured professorsnare being replaced with a cheaper option. Statistics over the last 10-20 yearsnpoint toward a growing trend in the employmentnof adjunct or part-time professors. Its the Uber economynwhere everythings freelance. What might be callednthe “adjunctivitis epidemic.” Ugh. “Adjunctivitis?” Okay no, only one disease per episode. Its why were talking about collegenand I havent once mentioned chlamydia. Adjuncts are the gig workersnof higher education. And they are nownteaching a lot of classes. Since 197, the percentage of tenured or tenure-track professors has dropped. But non-tenured teachers has shot up. Im not saying that adjuncts are bad. Its just that theyre expected to donthe same work as tenured professors, while getting treated like shit. We are notngiven any kind of benefits. No medical, no dental, no vision, no retirement, no family leave,nno sick leave, nothing. “To support his family, Rob Balla drives to three differentnOhio universities, to teach six English classes, and tutors on the side. He had pneumonia last fall,nworked anyway.” “Ellen Tara James-Penneynis an adjunct professor at San Jose State. On most nights, she sleeps in her car.” Can you imagine finding outnyour college teacher lives in their car? Thats almost as bad as finding out yourn2nd grade teacher doesnt live at school. “Mrs. Caldwell? Why are you at the movies? And who gave you jeans?” If your professor is runningnfrom college to college, working through pneumonia,nand living in their car, itll probably impactnthe quality of your education. Look, no one wants to go to office hoursnin a 07 Honda Civic. Hes like, “Hey, dont worry,nits leather seats.” Adjuncts have it pretty bad, butntheres one group that has it even worse: teaching assistants- grad studentsnwho are also paid to teach undergrads. Now we usually think of TAsnas slightly hornier professors. But they do a lot. At Purdue, 26% of grad students are the primary teachern at least one course. And if you want a 2-year-old to explainnDavid Foster ace to you, dont go to college,njust go on Hinge. TAs averagenless than $1,000 a year. $1,000!  only way it couldve been worse is if they got paidnin “Losing My Religion” dances. So its no surprisenthat tons of grad students are doing this: “Hundreds of grad student workersnat UC Santa Cruz are putting their jobs on the line. yve been on strike now  nearlyntwo weeks demanding higher pay.” “And theyre joinednby other schools north and south. Strikes are underway atnUC Santa Barbara and UC Davis.” “Ben Scheer, who hasnscratches on his head and arm, says cops arrested himn not moving when police approachednthe demonstrators in riot gear.” Why are the police wearing riot gear? What is Ben going to do? Attack younwith specific examples from the text? As many of you know, UC Santa Cruznis an old friend of the show. And its a pretty progressive place. So of course the school listened tonthe students, considered their concerns, and decided they could go fuck themselves. Weve learned the UC Santa Cruzngrading strike continues with a new round ofngraduate teaching assistants being fired.  striking group saysnthis leaves the grad students ineligible  unemployment benefitsnduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Ah, now I know why your schools mascotnis a banana slug. Cause your administration is gross, slimy,nand reminds everyone of flaccid dicks. Look, I know I used to say this as a joke,nbut now I mean it sincerely. Transfer to Berkeley.nYour parents will be prouder. By the way, grad studentsnhave been protesting at Harvard, Yale,nand the University of Chicago. So, if youre an incoming freshman,nthink about what this means. Youre paying a lot of money  school, but only a fraction of itnis going to your education. So youre probably wondering... where is my money going? re are people who makenhundreds of thousands of dollars as provosts, as presidents,nas chancellors, and between 1970 and 2008, the adjunct paynhas gone down 9%.  college presidents salarynhas gone up 3%. Lets break this down. While colleges were losingntenured professors, they were beefing up administratorsnat an insane rate. In over 30 years, the number ofnadministrators at private schools shot up 13%. Im talking deans, coordinators,nvice presidents, provosts. By the way... what the fuck is a provost? Does anybody actually know? Cause I googled it, and all it said was, “A person who does a thingnat a university.” So I clicked on Wikipedia, and a pop-up said, “re are some things you arentnmeant to know, Hasan.” But I clicked it anyway,nand this happened. I didnt realize EDM could sound so... threatening. What Im saying is, if I mysteriouslynvanish, you know what happened. Find the pallbearers. High level administratorsnare raking it in. In less than ten years, the number of presidents and chancellorsnmaking over a mil went from 28 to 76. That is an exponential spike. But presidents arent evennthe highest-paid administrators. If you want to see whos really making bank,ndont look at who runs the school. Look at who runs the endowment.nSo if any of you guys have graduated, you know that blocked number thatnrandomly calls you, asking  money? yre like, “Hey, were your college.nRemember us?” And youre like, “Nope! Ive given younassholes enough. Never call me again.”  money they collect from that callngoes into an endowment. And the people who manage that endowment often get paid more than anyone on campus. In 201, Yale spent $00 millionnon investment managers. Nearly three times what they spentnon tuition assistance. Which is odd,nbecause these funds are massive. “Princeton reported an endowmentnof $26.1 billion last year.” Stand has a $27 billion endowment. “ University of Texas, whichnhas a $31 billion endowment.” Harvard does happen to benthe richest college in the world. It has a $0 billion endowment. $0 billion! That is bigger than the economiesnof half the countries in the world, including Afghanistan,nHonduras, and Cambodia. Basically, Harvards endowmentnis bigger than the countries destroyed by its alumni. You got to give him props. Do you know hard it is to benthe biggest murderer from your school when you went to the same school as the fucking Unabomber? Bottom line: when you donate to a university, youre basically donating to a hedge fundnwith the same name as a university. And clearly endowment managersnhave a lot of responsibility. But the question is,ndoes it benefit your education? “Harvards website does say that it doesntnuse endowments to reduce tuition, because, one, they havento maintain the endowment, and much of it is restricted or set awayn specific projects. In 2018, most of the moneynwas put into things like hedge funds, real estate,nstocks and bonds.” To be fair, an endowment isnt likena bank account. re are restrictions. But criticizing themnhas become a bipartisan issue. se universities use the moneynto pay their administrators or put donors names on buildings, or just store the money,nkeep it, and invest it. Wait... its like Trump and Bernienswapped just one opinion. Somewhere, Bernie Sanders is giving a speechnabout how ugly Ted Cruzs wife is. “Shes a  at best! Swipe left.” Look, if anyone knowsnabout scamming college kids, its Trump. But he is right. Most schools only spend about %nof their endowments every year. And Harvard admits that 30%nof what they do spend is flexible. Thats $600 millionnflexible dollars a year! So maybe the next timentheres a global pandemic, you could do more to help these low-incomenstudents who had to start a GoFundMe. But no, its cool. Blow another hundred milnon vineyards instead. So, when you see schoolsnrelying on gig workers, firing employees who strike,nboosting president pay, and dumping money into hedge funds, this isnt the playbooknof an academic institution. This is the playbooknof a corporate institution. And thats a shiftnthats been going on  a long time. Since the recession in 2008, universities have seenntheir revenues decline, and overall state funding npublic colleges and universities remains $9 billionnbelow its pre-recession levels. If you go to an Ivy League school,nyoure fine. But state funding  public collegesnnever recovered from the 08 financial crisis. Tuition used to make up a thirdnof their funding. Today, its almost half. Which might not seem like a big deal, but it comes with a huge shiftnin priorities. If schools live or die by tuition, what do you think priority number onenis going to be? Chasing down kids who come from money. “Its housing fit  royalty.”  best of the best amenities. “And its offerednonly to college students.” This is a three-bedroom,ntwo-bath. “With state-of-the-art appliances,nchandeliers, and a wine fridge. Outside, theres a private Jacuzzi. Inside, a shower headnwith Bluetooth capability.” And  comes out the middle. I get trying to appeal to rich kids, but have they ever met one? No ones ever been like,n“That guy is so rich, I bet he listens to nout of his shower head.” Bee COVID, colleges were transmingninto playgrounds  rich kids. Im talking aboutna ball pit at MIT, a five-story rock climbingnwall at Auburn, even a private steak housenat High Point University. But  some reason, colleges have been obsessednwith one specific amenity. “Students at Louisiana State Universityncan now enjoy a 00-foot lazy rivernthat spells out ‘LSU.’” “yre getting a lazy rivernat college. This is all part of a new sports facilitynat the University of Central Florida.” When I saw that theynhad a lazy river, that definitely moved it upnon my top priority list. Whats with this theme park bullshit? Colleges shouldnt be funnlike Disney World. y should be soul-crushingnlike Epcot . Fuck that golf ball of sadness.nSeriously. Remember being a kid? Your parents would be like,n“Lets go to Epcot.” Youre like, “Yeah!” n you get there and theyre like,n“Hey kids, want to learn about physics?” Youre like, “Fuck this place.” By the way, that lazy river at LSUnwas part of a renovated facility worth almost $8 million. Which is crazy when you find outnwhere that money couldve gone. “LSU senior Catherine McKinneyntook us on a tour of what she says are her schoolsnquestionable priorities. At the library, we saw somenof the building literally falling apart.”  library has water in the basementnand rugs from another generation. Right. But you have a lazy river. But we have a lazy river, so maybenI should just go relax, you know? Do they have... chemistry?  school is falling apart,nbut I feel like theyre vibing. At the very least, theyre definitelyngoing to turn this into a romcom called  Lazy River. What is going on? We are turning universities,none of our best tools  social mobility, into a Carnival Cruisenthat caters to the rich. And that inequitynis only going to get worse. “Bee the pandemic,nthe gap was closing. More low-incomenfirst-generation students were enrollingnin colleges nationwide. Now advocates worrynthat progress could be lost. High school seniornOmar Quevedo-Catana had to startnworking full-time at Walmart after his mothernlost her house cleaning job.” Its really just me tryingnto keep everyone afloat. And... yeah, its been tough. Omars situation is exactly whatna lot of students are going through. You feel like youre in a catch-22: you cant afd college, but the rules of modern societynare cing you to go. So while were figuring out whatncollege will even look like in the future, now would be a good time to ask: what value are you even gettingnout of these schools? Weve clearly shown,ncollege is a business, which means youre the customer. And I dont want to be an Indian dadnabout this, but you got to make surenyou are getting what you pay . Because in ten years, a “lazy river” aint going to meannshit on your LinkedIn."
27,0,"You guys, this is  ,nor as its known in Saudi Arabia,xa0 Error 0, not found. [laughs] In case you dont know the full story, back in October, we did an episodexa0aboutxa0nthe Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salmannand his involvement in the killing of Washington Post journalistxa0nJamal Khashoggi, and the Kingdom wasnt thrilled. Well, Netflix under fire todaynafter its decision to pull an episode of a comedy show that was critical ofxa0nCrown Prince Mohammed binxa0Salman. [man]  , with ""Hasan Majan""-- -""Minhan""--n-[woman] Minhaj, yeah. Netflix confirmed it removed the episodenfrom streaming in Saudi Arabiaxa0 after the countrys Communications nand Inmation Technology Commission  made a request that it take it down. A request? Does MBS think Netflix is a wedding DJ? I have a quick request. Just take down that one episodexa0nthats criticizing me and then just play Ushers Yeah. A request is when a neighbor tells younto turn the  down. A demand is whenxa0nthat neighbor is Conor McGregor and youre in his parking spot. I still cant believe it. We got Saudi Arabiaxa0nto issue its very own Muslim ban. Netflix has received a request,xa0na legal request actually from Saudi Arabia to remove this episode. Saudi Arabian officials cited article six nof their anti-cybercrime law. Cybercrime. Youre telling me, even in Saudi prison,nIll be associated with the IT department. Okay, lets break downxa0nhow I became an Internet bad boy.xa0 According to article sixnof the Saudi Arabian anti-cybercrime law, any content that impinges on public order, religious valuesxa0nor public morals is prohibited. Of all the Netflix Originals,nthe only show that Saudi Arabia thinksxa0nviolates ""Muslim values"" is the one hosted by a Muslim. Do you know whats still streamingxa0nin Saudi Arabia? We got access to Netflix in Saudi Arabiaxa0nthrough an online proxy, which allows you to make it look likexa0nyour IP address is from another country. So, this is Netflix in Saudi Arabia. se shows are still streaming.nSabrina, still up. It has literal devil worshipxa0nand a lot of premarital witch sex. BoJack Horseman. res  an alcoholic horse-mannwho snorts cocaine. And lets not get those evil cooking shows. Porky goodness! Vitamin P!xa0 Fat from the hog, a la natural. [woman] It must be like Christmasxa0nevery time you break open a new pig. This is Haram City. Not eating pork is the one rulenevery Muslim agrees on. I have a cousin whos atheist,nand hell be rolling a blunt, drinking, and hell still be like, ""Hey, man, nis there pepperoni on that pizza?"" Look, I dont know if theres a Godnbut if there is one, he hates pepperoni. You know the most bizarre thingnabout this entire censorship fiasco? Saudi Arabia was our second episode,nand you can see right here, its missing. Okay? But in our last episodexa0nin December, episode seven,xa0 we had another segment criticizing MBS,nand it was called ""Saudi Arabia Update."" Yeah, our episode titlesxa0nare super straight ward. yre like an email from your parents.  subject line tells youxa0nexactly what youre gonna get. ""Subject: Hasan,xa0nI have a question about the Roku. Email: Hasan,xa0nI have a question about the Roku."" That episodexa0is still streamingxa0non Netflix inxa0Saudi Arabia. If youre going to crushxa0nall ms of dissent, dont half-ass it. But thats what happensxa0nwhen you got a countryxa0 thats run by people who got their jobxa0njust because of their dad. Now, heres the irony. By censoring our episode,nSaudi Arabia made us go viral Have they never heardxa0nof the Streisand Effect? It was great  the show,xa0nI got 60 new IGxa0followers. It was great. This story... got covered by everyonexa0nacross the political spectrum. For the first time in my life,xa0nI was a bipartisan icon. Yes! [cheering] Liberals and conservatives, they both embraced mexa0nlike I was money from Big Pharma. Cory Booker just bear hugged me like...n[roars] ""Get over here, buddy."" Even Breitbart defended me. Breitbart! You know how hard it was  Breitbart? y had to look at a picture of menand MBS and be like, ""Which one is browner? Is there a third option to hate?"" So hard  them. Let me be absolutely clear, Im not a victim here at all.nIm lucky, okay? I have the freedom to call Saudi Arabiaxa0n"" Boy Band Manager of 9/11."" I can criticize my own governmentnwithout any fear of repercussions. I can say Stephen Millerxa0ndeported his own hair  being brown. I can say those things... but those freedoms dont existxa0nin Saudi Arabia. Dozens of activistsxa0sit in Saudi jails,nmany without mal charges. So while I can make a jokexa0nabout being a ""cyber-criminal,"" this is no joke  many Saudi activists. According to Reprieve,  a human rights advocacy group,xa0nthat vague cybercrime lawxa0 that we allegedly broke, it is the very same lawxa0nthat is regularly cited in Saudi court to justify death sentences,xa0nlike in the case of Ali al-Nimr, a teenager who was sentenced to deathn protesting and using his BlackBerry to spread inmation about protests. This isnt about just censoringxa0none episode of a TV show, its about thexa0precedent. Because as tech companies keep expanding, theyre going to keep running intonmore vague censorship laws. Laws that can allow governmentsxa0nto pull any content at any time. Ultimately, xa0nSaudi doesnt care about ""immoral content"" that impinges on ""religious values."" yre mad that a Muslimnis airing out their dirty laundry. Now, look.nIve already been banned in one country. So I was thinking, ""Look,nyoure not built  this beef. Lets talk about somethingxa0na little less controversial."" China. Dont worry! Netflix isnt in China.  only thing they binge watchxa0nis their own people. China, of course,xa0nhas some of the toughest restrictionsxa0 on the Internet. No Facebook.xa0No YouTube. [man]  Chinese Communist Party encesna draconian system of censorship, dictating what Chinese can search,nand theyve done it  years. If you go to sites like Twitter,xa0nGoogle and Facebook, this is what you get. If you cant see that screen,xa0nthats exactly the point. China controlling its Internetnis a remarkable accomplishment that America never thoughtxa0nwould be possible. Now, theres no questionxa0China has been... trying to crack down on the Internet.n[chuckles] Good luck. Thats sort of likexa0trying to nail Jell-Onto the wall. That is such a creepy clipxa0nto watch right now. Not just becausexa0nof how wrong he was about China. But because were all picturing himnnailing Jell-O to the wall in the same way, right? With his penis? Okay, good. For Chinas 1. billion citizensnand 800 million Internet users, censorship is just part of life. China is so good at censorship,nthey gave themselves five stars. In China,ncensorship is a complex ecosystemxa0 of human beings,ntelecom and tech companies and laws that all givesnthe Communist Party and Chinas president Xi Jinpingxa0nthe ability to control what can be seen on the Internetnin real time. Its something known asn"" Great Firewall,"" which I know sounds likexa0na dessert at PF Changs,xa0 but there are whole piecesxa0nof Chinese history that the governmentxa0 doesnt allow to be taught in schools. And theyve been scrubbedxa0nfrom the Internet.  last major political protest in Chinaxa0nwas the spring of 1989. Thousands of people gatheredxa0nin Tiananmen Square to protest  democratic rems. But on June , 1989, the Chinese Armyxa0nopen fire on the crowd, killing citizens. And here are some Chinese millennials, ntoday being asked about it. Do you learn aboutxa0Tiananmen Squarenin history books? Not mentioned. -[woman] Yeah, not mentioned.n-Not mentioned at all? Thats crazy. Thats like asking a kidxa0nin high school, in America, if 9/11 is in their history booknand theyre like, ""9/11?  day Jay-Z came outxa0nwith  Blueprint? Youd be like,xa0n""How is that in your history book?"" So, if youre Chinese nand youre living in a world where the government decidesxa0nwhat you can and cant see, that must be some sort ofxa0ndystopian nightmare, right? Youre in China, the government can knowxa0neverything about you.  government already knowxa0neverything about me. Its just if Im not committing a crime,xa0nI dont give a shit.  bottom line is the Chinese in generalnare less concerned about data privacy than the consumers out in the West. res some subtle rules in China,nbut if you follow it,  and respect it,  you still havexa0nthe freedom to experience it. Remember, this is a rap battle organizer telling you to follow the rules. What a fucking nerd! If NWA started in China, ""Fuck the Police""nwould have been called, ""Sorry, officer.nIll try to be more careful next time."" Yes, websites like Google,xa0Twitter,nFacebook and YouTube are all blocked, but no one cares becausexa0nthey all have great Chinese doppelgangers like Baidu, Weibo, Youku nand WeChat,xa0 which blows Facebook out of the water. Life under censorship is pretty good. If youre just taking selfies, being thicknon Youku or shitposting on Weibo and... To anyone over 3, I swear to God,nmost of those words were English. However, if youre an activist,nthis is where things can get very scary. Especially under Chinas president,nXi Jinping. Since coming to power, he has crushed all ms of dissent. China is carrying out a broad crackdownnon people accusedxa0 of spreading so-called rumors online. Chung Ai-Ja, a mer school counselor, showed us the messagexa0nshe reposted on social media, an apparent jabxa0nat Chinas President Xi Jinping. Police showed up at her schoolxa0nto question her and days later, she was fired. Someone got firedn insulting the president online? Thats the only way to get a jobxa0nin my industry right now. Howd this all happen? President Xi has clamped down on NGOs,nlocked up human rights lawyers and issued sweeping new cybercrime laws,xa0nhe even temporarily bans wordsxa0 and phrases like, ""I disagree,""n""I oppose"" and ""my Emperor."" Words that question his authorityxa0nand  some reason, hes also banned the words,xa0n""roll up sleeves""xa0 and ""Im willing to be a vegetariann the rest of my life."" I feel like the only explanation is thatnPresident Xi had his heart broken by a stubborn vegetarianxa0nwith beautiful earms. And hes like, ""It is now illegalxa0nto remind me of her! God, I miss Susan so much."" Xi isnt just censoring wordsxa0nand historic events, he is censoring huge news storiesxa0nin real-time.  Communist Party in Chinanis persecuting a Muslim minority group called Uighurs. But if you live in China,nchances are you dont know any of this. [woman] Across the Northwestern provincexa0nof Xinjiang, an estimated one million Chinese Muslimsxa0nhave vanished into a vast networkxa0 of detention enters  what China callsn""re-education."" [man] After initially denyingnthe existence of prison camps,  Beijing now says it is sending nan unspecified number of peoplexa0  vocational training free of charge. Vocational training free of charge. Oh, I get it. America never had nJapanese internment camps. Those were desert getawaysxa0n the Asian-American community. North Korea doesnt have labor camps,xa0ntheyre WeWorks. res no Wi-Fi.xa0nEveryone is just really efficient. res one more. You guys are like,n""Is he gonna keep going?"" res a third.xa0nBangladesh doesnt have sweatshops. Those are Bikram work spaces. China doesnt want the world to knowxa0nwhats really happeningxa0 in the detention centers.xa0nOnline people have to move fastxa0 to get inmation nbee the government takes it down. and this is probably how its going to ben quite some time. Chinas ruling Communist Partyxa0nproposed Sunday to remove term limitsxa0 on the office of President. That means Xi Jinping who heads the partyxa0nand the military may never have to leave office. Xi Jinping will never retire. Its the one thing he has in commonxa0nwith millennials. Xi promotes a policy of cyber-sovereignty,nwhich he definesxa0 as the idea that China has the rightxa0nto control inmation within its bordersxa0 and block whatever the CCP deems harmful. It basically lets them take down anythingnthey want, whenever they want. Even if its completely random. Okay, so the British childrens shownPeppa Pig is very popular with kids worldwide,nbut its being banned in China  an unexpected reason.  sassy cartoon character has comexa0nto be associated with counterculture. [woman]nShe allegedly promotes gangster attitudes. Peppa Pig is a gangsta? Is Thomas the Tank Enginexa0ntransporting Special K? What is going on? At some point,nthe ban on Peppa Pig was liftedxa0 and thats why censorshipxa0nis such a mind fuck in China.  government is constantly changingnwhats allowed and whats not. So activists and censorsxa0arexa0nin a constant game of cat and mouse. ivists are constantly having to findnnew ways to evade the censorsxa0 and then censors are always lookingxa0n new ways to silence the activists. Take the case of Chen Guangcheng, known as CGC or the Blind Lawyer. [man]  Blind Lawyer became an icon nof human rights abuses in China after he exposed the way thousandsxa0nof women had undergone ced abortions. For seven years, he was held herenunder illegal house arrest. He and his family beaten savagely,nguarded round the clock. ivists started the hashtag #freeCGCnon social media and then censors immediately blockedxa0nall the hashtags. To get around the censors,nactivists then asked supporters to post selfies dressed upxa0nas the Blind Lawyer. And they did,nand the response was incredible. Even though they all look likexa0ntheyre auditioning to play BBQ Becky. But then something crazy happened. Mr. Chen has spent the last 18 monthsxa0nunder house arrest, but last Sunday, he escaped. A blind lawyer escaped house arrest? Can you imagine being the guard that let a blind lawyernslip away? How could both of them not see anything? As people started finding outxa0nChen escaped, censors got to work, taking down his initialsnand even the words ""blind man."" To get around the censors,xa0nactivists hit backxa0 with an incredibly powerful weapon. Memes. Now, I know in America, memes arexa0njust used to humanize Squidward, but in China,ntheyre also a popular tool  dissent. In the case of the blind lawyer,nthis meme went viral. Yeah, thats the pig from Angry Birds, staring at the tunnelnin the Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank memes became so popular, the censors blocked any mentionxa0nof  Shawshank Redemption. By the way,n any people watching in China, Tim Robbins escapes from prison. You totally dont see it coming,xa0nkind of like the blind lawyer escaping. Clearly, the CCP always has the upper handnwhen it comes to censoring content. y have the resources,xa0nthe infrastructure, the manpower,xa0 all of which makes it really hardxa0n any grassroots movementxa0 to gain momentum. However... in the last year,xa0ntheres been a new movement  that has started to take hold in China, and it may be unlike anythingxa0nthat has ever come bee it.  [woman] #MeToo, in the US its beenxa0nchampioned by celebrities. In China, its a fledgling movementnled mainly by university students. Chinas #MeToo movementxa0nhas been calledxa0 one of the first coordinated studentxa0nprotest movements since Tiananmen Square.  #MeToo movement is a unique problemxa0n the CCPxa0 because the Communist Party is technicallynfounded on egalitarian principles, the same way Americaxa0is technicallyxa0nfounded on the idea of democracy. And Maroon  is technically foundedxa0non the idea of . Even from the CCPs early days,xa0nMao famously said, ""Women hold up half the sky.""n CCPs doctrine is equality  all. But that hasnt stopped themxa0nfrom telling women what to do with their bodies. Once notoriousxa0n its strict one-child policy, China now considering proposalsnto push women to have more babies. Beijing is worried that having onexa0nof the lowest birth rates in the world will undermine its eftsxa0nto stimulate the economy. For years, they outlawedxa0nhaving more than one child. Now, theyre trying to shame single womenninto getting married  and having babiesxa0nby calling them ""leftover women."" Even Mike Pence wouldnt support this,nhed be like,  ""Look, government isnt aboutncing women to have babies. its about cing women to keep them. Keep your eye on the ball, Xi."" And hes like, ""Im sorry. I cant stop thinking about Susan. Maybe I should have compromisedxa0nand been a vegetarian."" How insecure are you, CCP? yre basically one step awayxa0nfrom passing a law that says, all Chinese men have girlfriends. y just goxa0nto a different high school, okay? But now thatxa0#MeToo has surfaced, its clear women have had enough. y want the CCP to make good on the founding valuesxa0nof the party, equality. And theyre speaking out online in a waynthey never have bee. Despite censorship, a huge partxa0nof whyxa0#MeToo has taken offxa0 is because of social media.n#MeToo in China effectively started on January 1, 2018, after Luo Xixi,na mer PhD student posted on social mediaxa0nclaiming shed been sexually assaulted by her adviser in 200, which he denied. But the post blew up. Since Luo Xixi first reported the abusexa0non Sina Weibo on January 1st, her complaint has been viewedxa0naround five million times. [womans voice] I stepped up simply because nI dont want other people to get hurt. But the discussionxa0nand the reactions on the Internet and in Chinese societyxa0nhave really surprised me. Censors eventually took downxa0a majorityxa0nof thexa0#MeToo postsxa0 and the variations of the hashtag. Thats when the arms race began. To dodge the sensors,xa0Chinas womenxa0nstarted using Chinese wordsxa0 that sounded similar to ""Me Too."" So, in Chinese ""mi"" means ""rice""nand ""tù"" means ""bunny,"" so Chinas #MeToo activistsnbecame rice bunnies. Which if you listen to it, it kind of sounds like somethingxa0nSteve Harvey got fired  saying. Hes like,n""Hey, whats up, you rice bunny?"" And theyre like, ""Steve! Why are you saying that?""nAnd hes like, ""Think like a man."" ivists posted rotated photos of text,nwhich makes messages unsearchable. It even used blockchain nto make a #MeToo letter harder to delete, and that totally makes sense becausenno one knows what the fuck blockchain is. Bitcoins at 3,000. Since Luo Xixis story hit Weibo,xa0 thousands of students have petitionedxa0ntheir colleges  anti-harassment policies.xa0nThis is a big deal,xa0 because in China,xa0nsexual harassment is rampant. [woman] A survey of 7,000 studentsxa0nby NGO, the Guangzhou Gender , found while almost 70% of respondentsxa0nhad been sexually harassed, only % reported it to the authorities. More than 0% of female commutersnhave been assaulted while riding Chinas subways. Dozens of women have come wardxa0nto accuse some pretty high-profile men. Like TV host Zhu Jun. He was accusedxa0nby a woman named Zhou Xiaoxuan, who claims he harassed herxa0nwhen she was a 20-year-old intern and he was almost 0. Zhu has denied the allegations, but this was a huge deal because Zhu Junxa0nis one of Chinas most famous TV anchors known  hostingxa0nthe state New Years Gala. [rooster crowing] [singing in Chinese] That was Zhu Junxa0nwith a bunch of spring chickens,  which also happens to bexa0nhis ideal age range on Tinder. Now, a big reason why so many womennhave had to turn to social media is because if youre assaulted or harassed,nthere are very few good legal options. Chinas legal system is poorly set upxa0n dealing with assault allegations. [man] res no legal definitionxa0nof sexual harassment here and no standardized way nof reportingxa0sexual assault. China has very little recoursen victims of sexual assault, and thats somethingxa0activistsxa0nhave been fighting to change long beexa0#MeToo.xa0nivists like Liang Xiaowen. She has organized protestsxa0nand co-founded a grassroots feminist NGO, which are risky things to do in China. So I sat down with herxa0nto talk about her work  world is kind of hostile to womennwho want things. It scares people becausexa0nwomen are standing up. Tell me about the things thatxa0nyour family has had to go throughxa0 because of your activism. Years ago,xa0I was trying to host a seminarxa0nabout womens rights, but then I received a call from my dad. He told me that not only the local police but alsoxa0his employer,xa0nhis boss is at his home now. So the police went toxa0friendsxa0nand co-workers -to talk to your dad?n-Yes. And the parents would go,xa0n""Please dont do this."" And that generally worksxa0nbecause Asian parents can crush dreams. Yeah. You hear that? Thats the sigh of a thousand ""A minuses."" No. President Xi doing this... is some straight-up Naila Aunty bullshit. Like, ""Im not gonna go to you directly. Ill find the parentsxa0nto crush their dreams."" And because of pressure from the policenthrough the parentsxa0 and her family,xa0nXiaowen came to the United States to study and to continue to fightxa0n womens rights in China. What does the Chinese government think about the work youre doing?  Chinese government would consider usxa0nto be Western hostile ces or being controlledxa0nby Western hostile ces. What would they consider me? Well, if you were that important, then they would consider younas Western hostile ces-- -Are you saying Im not important?n-Not in China. -Im sorry.n-Have they seen the show? -I have seen your show.n-No, but have they seen the show? -What show?n- show youre on. -This show.n-I dont know. But if Im in it, I promise that,xa0nat least, some people will see it. Have they seenxa0 Spy Who Dumped Me? No, I dont know. I mean, I havent. Did they see MTVs Disaster Datenseason four? Now you are just making things up. No, Im not! Listen, Party Rock Anthem nhad come out that year, and I thought Redfoo was going to bexa0nthe next Justin Timberlake. Okay, Xiaowens creditsxa0nare a bit more impressive than mine. She has worked closely with a group callednthe Feminist Five, who made international headlinesxa0backnin 201. [singing in Chinese] [man] se women are singingxa0non the Beijing Subway to raise awarenessxa0nagainst abuse and discrimination. And here, dressing upxa0nis blood-stained bridesxa0 to encourage women to stand upnagainst domestic violence,xa0 but five of these womenxa0nwere detained recently   what authorities called,n""picking quarrels."" It is hilarious to mexa0nthat men relegated women to secretarial work  decades, and now we turn around, and were like, ""Where did these women learn to organizenand plan meetings? Who is responsible  this? Why are they picking quarrels?""  global backlashxa0nto the detention on the Feminist Fivexa0 was so intense,xa0nthe CCP actually released the women after 37 days. I was going to be sentencednover five years. y didnt beat me. Yeah, they dont touch mexa0nand maybe due to the-- A lot of pressure from... internal and external. If they insulted my sexual orientation,nit doesnt work, Thats it. Cause Im a lesbian. Whats wrong?xa0Whats up? Yeah, the CCP thoughtnPeppa Pig was gangsta? Nah, this is gangsta. Just a few months afterxa0nthe Five were released, President Xi spokenat the UN Womens Conference and said this... [womans voice]nIn many parts of the world however, disparities remainxa0nin the level of womens development. As we speak... various ms of discriminationxa0nagainst women are still taking place. Hmm... Interesting choicexa0nto use a female translator. Hes like see, ""I give women a voice. Whats next? Susan."" In the past year,xa0n#MeToo has made some gains. What is the biggest victoryxa0nthat youve seen, at the government level, of your activism?  first one happened last year, the new civil code explicitly... said that employers should notxa0nsexually harass employees. And the second,xa0nnow people can sue under sexual harassment and gender discrimination. -Thats major.n-It is.  CCP has agreed to add a definitionxa0nof sexual harassment to Chinas civil codexa0nand the Supreme Court says, you can now filexa0na sexual harassment lawsuitxa0  the first time in China. Remember creepy TV host Zhu Jun?xa0xa0nSpring chickens? Remember him? Yes. He actually sued his accuser,nZhou Xiaoxuan, and then she counter-sued himnand is now trying to make her casexa0 a sexual harassment lawsuit,nand if it is accepted by the court,xa0 it would be the first-ever civilxa0nsexual harassment lawsuit  in Chinese history. This is very differentxa0nin the #MeToo movement. People just dont let it go away anymore. People want these universitiesnto say something, to do something, to change the situation. Its not what its like bee. People have suffered enough,nyoung women have suffered enough. y want-- y demand changes.  CCP and President Xixa0nare doing everything they canxa0 to consolidate powernand silence anyone who speaks out. Chinas #MeToo movement is persistingnin the face of censorship, and it is inspiring, and we can only hope nthat these small victoriesxa0 will lead to even larger ones."
28,0,"In the early days of Twitter,nit was like a place of radical de-shaming. People would admitnshameful secrets about themselves, and other people would say,n""Oh my God, Im exactly the same."" Voiceless people realizednthat they had a voice, and it was powerful and eloquent. If a newspaper ran some racistnor homophobic column, we realized we could donsomething about it. We could get them. We could hit them with a weaponnthat we understood but they didnt -- a social media shaming. Advertisers would withdrawntheir advertising. When powerful peoplenmisused their privilege, we were going to get them. This was like thendemocratization of justice. Hierarchies were being leveled out. We were going to do things better. Soon after that, a disgracednpop science writer called Jonah Lehrer -- hed been caught plagiarizingnand faking quotes, and he was drenched in shamenand regret, he told me. And he had the opportunity to publicly apologizenat a foundation lunch. This was going to be the mostnimportant speech of his life. Maybe it would win him some salvation. He knew bee he arrived that the foundation was going to benlive-streaming his event, but what he didnt knownuntil he turned up, was that theyd erected a giant screennTwitter feed right next to his head. () Another one in a monitor screennin his eye line. I dont think the foundation did thisnbecause they were monstrous. I think they were clueless:nI think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasinglynhorrific reality. And here were some of the Tweetsnthat were cascading into his eye line, as he was trying to apologize: ""Jonah Lehrer, boring usninto giving him."" () And, ""Jonah Lehrer has not provennthat he is capable of feeling shame."" That one must have been writtennby the best psychiatrist ever, to know that about suchna tiny figure behind a lectern. And, ""Jonah Lehrer is justna frigging sociopath."" That last word is a very human thingnto do, to dehumanize the people we hurt. Its because we want to destroy peoplenbut not feel bad about it. Imagine if this was an actual court, and the accused was in the dark,nbegging  another chance, and the jury was yelling out, ""Bored! Sociopath!"" () You know, when we watchncourtroom dramas, we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney, but give us the power,nand we become like hanging judges. Power shifts fast. We were getting Jonah because he wasnperceived to have misused his privilege, but Jonah was on the floor then,nand we were still kicking, and congratulating ourselvesn punching up. And it began to feel weird and emptynwhen there wasnt a powerful person who had misused their privilegenthat we could get. A day without a shamingnbegan to feel like a day picking fingernails and treading water. Let me tell you a story. Its about a woman called Justine Sacco. She was a PR woman from New Yorknwith 170 Twitter followers, and shed Tweet littlenacerbic jokes to them, like this one on a planenfrom New York to London: [Weird German Dude: Youre in first class.nIts 201. Get some deodorant."" -Inner monologue as inhale BO.nThank god  pharmaceuticals.] So Justine chuckled to herself,nand pressed send, and got no replies, and felt that sad feeling that we all feel when the Internet doesntncongratulate us  being funny. () Black silence when the Internetndoesnt talk back. And then she got to Heathrow,nand she had a little time to spare bee her final leg, so she thought upnanother funny little acerbic joke: [Going to Africa. Hope I dont get AIDS.nJust kidding. Im white!] And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,ngot on the plane, got no replies, turned off her phone, fell asleep, woke up 11 hours later, turned on her phone while the planenwas taxiing on the runway, and straightaway there wasna message from somebody that she hadnt spokennto since high school, that said, ""I am so sorrynto see whats happening to you."" And then another messagenfrom a best friend, ""You need to call me right now. You are the worldwide number onentrending topic on Twitter."" () What had happened is that onenof her 170 followers had sent the Tweet to a Gawker journalist, and henretweeted it to his 1,000 followers: [And now, a funny holiday jokenfrom IACs PR boss] And then it was like a bolt of lightning. A few weeks later, I talkednto the Gawker journalist. I emailed him and asked him how it felt,nand he said, ""It felt delicious."" And then he said,n""But Im sure shes fine."" But she wasnt fine,nbecause while she slept, Twitter took control of her lifenand dismantled it piece by piece. First there were the philanthropists: [If @JustineSaccos untunatenwords ... bother you, join me in supportingn@CAREs work in Africa.] [In light of ... disgusting,nracist tweet, Im donating to @care today] n came the beyond horrified: [... no words  that horribly disgustingnracist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco. I am beyond horrified.] Was anybody on Twitternthat night? A few of you. Did Justines joke overwhelmnyour Twitter feed the way it did mine? It did mine, and I thoughtnwhat everybody thought that night, which was, ""Wow, somebodys screwed! Somebodys life is about to get terrible!"" And I sat up in my bed, and I put the pillow behind my head, and then I thought, Im not entirely surenthat joke was intended to be racist. Maybe instead of gleefullynflaunting her privilege, she was mocking the gleefulnflaunting of privilege. res a comedy tradition of this, like South Park or Colbertnor Randy Newman. Maybe Justine Saccos crime was not beingnas good at it as Randy Newman. In fact, when I met Justinena couple of weeks later in a bar, she was just crushed, and I asked her to explain the joke, and she said, ""Living in Americanputs us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going onnin the Third World. I was making of fun of that bubble."" You know, another woman on Twitter thatnnight, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis, she reviewed my book on public shamingnand wrote that she Tweeted that night, ""Im not sure that her jokenwas intended to be racist,"" and she said straightaway she gotna fury of Tweets saying, ""Well, youre justna privileged bitch, too."" And so to her shame, she wrote, she shut up and watchednas Justines life got torn apart. It started to get darker: [Everyone go reportnthis cunt @JustineSacco] n came the calls  her to be fired. [Good luck with the job huntnin the new year. #GettingFired] Thousands of people around the world decided it was their dutynto get her fired. [@JustineSacco last tweetnof your career. #SorryNotSorry Corporations got involved,nhoping to sell their products on the back of Justines annihilation: [Next time you plan to tweet somethingnstupid bee you take off, make sure you are gettingnon a @Gogo flight!] () A lot of companies were makingngood money that night. You know, Justines name was normallynGoogled 0 times a month. That month, between December the 20thnand the end of December, her name was Googled 1,220,000 times. And one Internet economist told menthat that meant that Google made somewhere between 120,000 dollarsnand 68,000 dollars from Justines annihilation, whereasnthose of us doing the actual shaming -- we got nothing. () We were like unpaidnshaming interns  Google. () And then came the trolls: [Im actually kind of hopingnJustine Sacco gets aids? lol] Somebody else on that wrote, ""Somebody HIV-positive should rapenthis bitch and then well find out if her skin color protects her from AIDS."" And that person got a free pass. Nobody went after that person. We were all so excitednabout destroying Justine, and our shaming brainsnare so simple-minded, that we couldnt also handlendestroying somebody who was inappropriatelyndestroying Justine. Justine was really unitingna lot of disparate groups that night, from philanthropists to ""rape the bitch."" [@JustineSacco I hope you get fired!nYou demented bitch... Just let the world know youre planningnto ride bare back while in Africa.] Women always have it worse than men. When a man gets shamed, its,n""Im going to get you fired."" When a woman gets shamed, its, ""Im going to get you firednand raped and cut out your uterus."" And then Justines employers got involved: [IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is annoutrageous, offensive comment. Employee in question currentlynunreachable on an intl flight.] And thats when the angernturned to excitement: [All I want  Christmas is to seen@JustineSaccos face when her plane lands and she checksnher inbox/voicemail. #fired] [Oh man, @justinesacconis going to have the most painful phone-turning-on moment evernwhen her plane lands.] [We are about to watch this @JustineSacconbitch get fired. In REAL time. Bee she even KNOWSnshes getting fired.] What we had wasna delightful narrative arc. We knew something that Justine didnt. Can you think of anythingnless judicial than this? Justine was asleep on a planenand unable to explain herself, and her inability wasna huge part of the hilarity. On Twitter that night, we werenlike toddlers crawling towards a gun. Somebody worked out exactlynwhich plane she was on, so they linked to a flight tracker website. [British Airways Flight 3nOn-time - arrives in 1 hour 3 minutes] A hashtag began trending worldwide: # hasJustineLandedYet? [It is kinda wildnto see someone self-destruct without them even being aware of it.n#hasJustineLandedYet] [Seriously. I just want to go homento go to bed, but everyone at the bar is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.nCant look away. Cant leave.] [#HasJustineLandedYet may be the bestnthing to happen to my Friday night.] [Is no one in Cape Town goingnto the airport to tweet her arrival? Come on, twitter! Id like pictures] And guess what? Yes there was. [@JustineSacco HAS in fact landednat Cape Town international. And if you want to knownwhat it looks like to discover that youve just been torn to shredsnbecause of a misconstrued liberal joke, not by trolls, but by nice people like us, this is what it looks like: [... Shes decided to wearnsunnies as a disguise.] So why did we do it? I think some people were genuinely upset, but I think  other people, its because Twitter is basicallyna mutual approval machine. We surround ourselves with peoplenwho feel the same way we do, and we approve each other, and thats a really good feeling. And if somebody gets in the way,nwe screen them out. And do you know whatnthats the opposite of? Its the opposite of democracy. We wanted to show that we carednabout people dying of AIDS in Africa. Our desire to be seen to be compassionatenis what led us to commit this profoundly un-compassionate act. As Meghan OGieblyn wrotenin the Boston Review, ""This isnt social justice.nIts a cathartic alternative."" For the past three years, Ive been going around the worldnmeeting people like Justine Sacco -- and believe me, theres a lotnof people like Justine Sacco. res more every day. And we want to think theyre fine,nbut theyre not fine.  people I met were mangled. y talked to me about depression, and anxiety and insomnianand suicidal thoughts. One woman I talked to,nwho also told a joke that landed badly, she stayed home  a year and a half. Bee that, she worked with adultsnwith learning difficulties, and was apparently really good at her job. Justine was fired, of course,nbecause social media demanded it. But it was worse than that. She was losing herself. She was waking up in the middlenof the night, getting who she was. She was got because she was perceivednto have misused her privilege. And of course, thats a much better thingnto get people  than the things we used to get people ,nlike having children out of wedlock. But the phrase ""misuse of privilege""nis becoming a free pass to tear apart pretty muchnanybody we choose to. Its becoming a devalued term, and its making us losenour capacity  empathy and  distinguishing between seriousnand unserious transgressions. Justine had 170 Twitter followers,nand so to make it work, she had to be fictionalized. Word got around that she was the daughternthe mining billionaire Desmond Sacco. [Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacconher father is a SA mining billionaire. Shes not sorry.nAnd neither is her father.] I thought that was true about Justine, until I met her at a bar, and I asked hernabout her billionaire father, and she said, ""My father sells carpets."" And I think back onnthe early days of Twitter, when people would admitnshameful secrets about themselves, and other people would say,n""Oh my God, Im exactly the same."" se days, the hunt is onn peoples shameful secrets. You can lead a good, ethical life, but some bad phraseology in a Tweetncan overwhelm it all, become a clue to your secret inner evil. Maybe theres two typesnof people in the world: those people who favornhumans over ideology, and those people who favornideology over humans. I favor humans over ideology, but right now, the ideologues are winning, and theyre creating a stagen constant artificial high dramas where everybodys eitherna magnificent hero or a sickening villain, even though we know thats not truenabout our fellow humans. Whats true is thatnwe are clever and stupid; whats true is that were grey areas.  great thing about social medianwas how it gave a voice to voiceless people, but were now creatingna surveillance society, where the smartest way to survivenis to go back to being voiceless. Lets not do that. Thank you. () Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon. Jon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno. BG: Dont go away. What strikes me about Justines story is also the fact that if younGoogle her name today, this story covers the firstn100 pages of Google results -- there is nothing else about her. In your book, you mention another story of another victim who actually gotntaken on by a reputation management firm, and by creating blogs and posting nice,ninnocuous stories about her love  cats and holidays and stuff,nmanaged to get the story off the first couple pages of Googlenresults, but it didnt last long. A couple of weeks later, they startedncreeping back up to the top result. Is this a totally lost battle? Jon Ronson: You know, I thinknthe very best thing we can do, if you see a kind of unfairnor an ambiguous shaming, is to speak up, because I thinknthe worst thing that happened to Justine was that nobody supported her --nlike, everyone was against her, and that is profoundly traumatizing, to be told by tens of thousands of peoplenthat you need to get out. But if a shaming happens and theresna babble of voices, like in a democracy, where people are discussing it,nI think thats much less damaging. So I think thats the way ward, but its hard, because if you donstand up  somebody, its incredibly unpleasant. BG: So lets talk about your experience, because you stood up by writing this book. By the way, its mandatorynreading  everybody, okay? You stood up because the booknactually puts the spotlight on shamers. And I assume you didnt onlynhave friendly reactions on Twitter. JR: It didnt go down that wellnwith some people. () I mean, you dont wantnto just concentrate -- because lots of people understood,nand were really nice about the book. But yeah,  30 years Ive been writingnstories about abuses of power, and when I say the powerful peoplenover there in the military, or in the pharmaceutical industry,neverybody applauds me. As soon as I say, ""We are the powerfulnpeople abusing our power now,"" I get people saying,n""Well you must be a racist too."" BG: So the other night --nyesterday -- we were at dinner, and there were two discussions going on. On one side you were talkingnwith people around the table -- and that was a nice,nconstructive discussion. On the other, every timenyou turned to your phone, there is this deluge of insults. JR: Yeah. This happened last night.nWe had like a  dinner last night. We were chatting and it was lovelynand nice, and I decided to check Twitter. Somebody said, ""You arena white supremacist."" And then I went back and hadna nice conversation with somebody, and then I went back to Twitter, somebody said my very existencenmade the world a worse place. My friend Adam Curtis says that maybe the Internet is likena John Carpenter movie from the 1980s, when eventually everyonenwill start screaming at each other and shooting each other,nand then eventually everybody would flee to somewhere safer, and Im starting to think of thatnas a really nice option. BG: Jon, thank you.nJR: Thank you, Bruno. ()"
29,0,"For a really long time, I had two mysteriesnthat were hanging over me. I didnt understand them and, to be honest, I was quite afraidnto look into them.  first mystery was, Im 0 years old, and all throughout my lifetime,nyear after year, serious depression and anxiety have risen, in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world. And I wanted to understand why. Why is this happening to us? Why is it that with each year that passes, more and more of us are finding it hardernto get through the day? And I wanted to understand thisnbecause of a more personal mystery. When I was a teenager, I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling,nlike pain was leaking out of me. I couldnt control it, I didnt understand why it was happening, I felt quite ashamed of it. And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was well-intentioned, but quite oversimplified. Not totally wrong. My doctor said, ""We knownwhy people get like this. Some people just naturally getna chemical imbalance in their heads -- youre clearly one of them. All we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemicalnbalance back to normal."" So I started taking a drugncalled Paxil or Seroxat, its the same thing with different namesnin different countries. And I felt much better,nI got a real boost. But not very long afterwards, this feeling of pain started to come back. So I was given higher and higher doses until,  13 years, I was takingnthe maximum possible dose that youre legally allowed to take. And  a lot of those 13 years,nand pretty much all the time by the end, I was still in a lot of pain. And I started asking myself,n""Whats going on here? Because youre doing everything youre told to do by the storynthats dominating the culture -- why do you still feel like this?"" So to get to the bottomnof these two mysteries,  a book that Ive written I ended up going on a big journeynall over the world, I traveled over 0,000 miles. I wanted to sit with the leadingnexperts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially, what solves them, and people who have come throughndepression and anxiety and out the other sidenin all sorts of ways. And I learned a huge amount from the amazing peoplenI got to know along the way. But I think at the heartnof what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence  nine different causesnof depression and anxiety. Two of them are indeed in our biology. Your genes can make younmore sensitive to these problems, though they dont write your destiny. And there are real brain changesnthat can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. But most of the factorsnthat have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology. y are factors in the way we live. And once you understand them, it opens up a very differentnset of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the optionnof chemical antidepressants. For example, if youre lonely, youre more likelynto become depressed. If, when you go to work,nyou dont have any control over your job, youve just got to do what youre told, youre more likely to become depressed. If you very rarely get outninto the natural world, youre more likely to become depressed. And one thing unites a lot of the causesnof depression and anxiety that I learned about. Not all of them, but a lot of them. Everyone here knows youve all got naturalnphysical needs, right? Obviously. You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. If I took those things away from you, youd all be in real trouble, real fast. But at the same time, every human beingnhas natural psychological needs. You need to feel you belong. You need to feel your lifenhas meaning and purpose. You need to feel that peoplensee you and value you. You need to feel youve gotna future that makes sense. And this culture we builtnis good at lots of things. And many things are betternthan in the past -- Im glad to be alive today. But weve been getting less and less good at meeting these deep,nunderlying psychological needs. And its not the only thingnthats going on, but I think its the key reasonnwhy this crisis keeps rising and rising. And I found this really hard to absorb. I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depressionnas just a problem in my brain, to one with many causes, including many in the way were living. And it only really begannto fall into place  me when one day, I went to interviewna South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. Hes a great guy. And Dr. Summerfieldnhappened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introducednchemical antidepressants  people in that country. And the local doctors, the Cambodians,nhad never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explained. And they said to him, ""We dont need them,nweve already got antidepressants."" And he was like, ""What do you mean?"" He thought they were going to talk aboutnsome kind of herbal remedy, like St. Johns Wort, ginkgo biloba,nsomething like that. Instead, they told him a story. re was a farmer in their communitynwho worked in the rice fields. And one day, he stood on a land mine left over from the warnwith the United States, and he got his leg blown off. So they him an artificial leg, and after a while, he went backnto work in the rice fields. But apparently, its super painfulnto work under water when youve got an artificial limb, and Im guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the fieldnwhere he got blown up.  guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out of bed, he developed all the symptomsnof classic depression.  Cambodian doctor said, ""This is when we gave himnan antidepressant."" And Dr. Summerfield said,n""What was it?"" y explained that they wentnand sat with him. y listened to him. y realized that his pain made sense -- it was hard  him to see itnin the throes of his depression, but actually, it had perfectlynunderstandable causes in his life. One of the doctors, talking to the peoplenin the community, figured, ""You know, if we bought this guy a cow, he could become a dairy farmer, he wouldnt be in this positionnthat was screwing him up so much, he wouldnt have to gonand work in the rice fields."" So they bought him a cow. Within a couple of weeks,nhis crying stopped, within a month, his depression was gone. y said to doctor Summerfield, ""So you see, doctor, that cow,nthat was an antidepressant, thats what you mean, right?"" () () If youd been raised to thinknabout depression the way I was, and most of the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? ""I went to my doctorn an antidepressant, she gave me a cow."" But what those Cambodianndoctors knew intuitively, based on this individual,nunscientific anecdote, is what the leadingnmedical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us  years, based on the best scientific evidence. If youre depressed, if youre anxious, youre not weak, youre not crazy, youre not, in the main,na machine with broken parts. Youre a human being with unmet needs. And its just as important to think herenabout what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organizationnare not saying. y did not say to this farmer, ""Hey, buddy, you neednto pull yourself together. Its your job to figure outnand fix this problem on your own."" On the contrary, what they said is, ""Were here as a groupnto pull together with you, so together, we can figure outnand fix this problem."" This is what every depressed person needs, and its what everyndepressed person deserves. This is why one of the leadingndoctors at the United Nations, in their official statementn World Health Day, couple of years back in 2017, said we need to talk lessnabout chemical imbalances and more about the imbalancesnin the way we live. Drugs give real relief to some people -- they gave relief to me  a while -- but precisely because this problemngoes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. But when I first learned that, I remember thinking, ""OK, I could seenall the scientific evidence, I read a huge number of studies, I interviewed a huge number of the expertsnwho were explaining this,"" but I kept thinking, ""How can wenpossibly do that?""  things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complexnthan what was going on with this Cambodian farmer. Where do we even begin with that insight? But then, in the long journey  my book, all over the world, I kept meeting peoplenwho were doing exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo. I kept meeting peoplenwho were understanding the deeper causesnof depression and anxiety and, as groups, fixing them. Obviously, I cant tell younabout all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about, or all of the nine causes of depressionnand anxiety that I learned about, because they wont let me givena 10-hour  Talk -- you can complain about that to them. But I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutionsnthat emerge from them, if thats alright. Heres the first. We are the loneliest societynin human history. re was a recent studynthat asked Americans, ""Do you feel like youre no longernclose to anyone?"" And 39 percent of peoplensaid that described them. ""No longer close to anyone."" In the internationalnmeasurements of loneliness, Britain and the rest of Europenare just behind the US, in case anyone here is feeling smug. () I spent a lot of time discussing this with the leading expertnin the world on loneliness, an incredible mannnamed professor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago, and I thought a lot about one questionnhis work poses to us. Professor Cacioppo asked, ""Why do we exist? Why are we here, why are we alive?"" One key reason is that our ancestorsnon the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing. y werent bigger than the animalsnthey took down a lot of the time, they werent faster than the animalsnthey took down a lot of the time, but they were much betternat banding together into groups and cooperating. This was our superpower as a species -- we band together, just like bees evolved to live in a hive, humans evolved to live in a tribe. And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes. And it is making us feel awful. But it doesnt have to be this way. One of the heroes in my book,nand in fact, in my life, is a doctor named Sam Everington. Hes a general practitionernin a poor part of East London, where I lived  many years. And Sam was really uncomtable, because he had loads of patients coming to him with terriblendepression and anxiety. And like me, hes not opposednto chemical antidepressants, he thinks they givensome relief to some people. But he could see two things. Firstly, his patients were depressednand anxious a lot of the time  totally understandablenreasons, like loneliness. And secondly, although the drugsnwere giving some relief to some people,  many people,nthey didnt solve the problem.  underlying problem. One day, Sam decidednto pioneer a different approach. A woman came to his center,nhis medical center, called Lisa Cunningham. I got to know Lisa later. And Lisa had been shut away in her homenwith crippling depression and anxiety  seven years. And when she came to Sams center,nshe was told, ""Dont worry, well carry on giving you these drugs, but were also going to prescribensomething else. Were going to prescribe  younto come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group of otherndepressed and anxious people, not to talk about how miserable you are, but to figure out somethingnmeaningful you can all do together so you wont be lonely and you wont feelnlike life is pointless.""  first time this group met, Lisa literally startednvomiting with anxiety, it was so overwhelming  her. But people rubbed her back,nthe group started talking, they were like, ""What could we do?"" se are inner-city,nEast London people like me, they didnt know anything about gardening. y were like, ""Why dont wenlearn gardening?"" re was an areanbehind the doctors offices that was just scrubland. ""Why dont we make this into a garden?"" y started to take booksnout of the library, started to watch YouTube clips. y started to getntheir fingers in the soil. y started to learnnthe rhythms of the seasons. res a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant. But they started to do somethingneven more important. y started to m a tribe. y started to m a group. y started to care about each other. If one of them didnt show up, the others would gonlooking  them -- ""Are you OK?"" Help them figure outnwhat was troubling them that day.  way Lisa put it to me, ""As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom."" This approach is callednsocial prescribing, its spreading all over Europe. And theres a small,nbut growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce realnand meaningful falls in depression and anxiety. And one day, I remembernstanding in the garden that Lisa and her once-depressednfriends had built -- its a really beautiful garden -- and having this thought, its very much inspired by a guyncalled professor Hugh Mackay in Australia. I was thinking, so oftennwhen people feel down in this culture, what we say to them -- Im sureneveryone here said it, I have -- we say, ""You just neednto be you, be yourself."" And Ive realized, actually,nwhat we should say to people is, ""Dont be you. Dont be yourself. Be us, be we. Be part of a group."" ()  solution to these problems does not lie in drawingnmore and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- thats partly what got us in this crisis. It lies on reconnectingnwith something bigger than you. And that really connectsnto one of the other causes of depression and anxietynthat I wanted to talk to you about. So everyone knows junk food has taken over our dietsnand made us physically sick. I dont say thatnwith any sense of superiority, I literally came to giventhis talk from McDonalds. I saw all of you eating thatnhealthy  breakfast, I was like no way. But just like junk food has taken overnour diets and made us physically sick, a kind of junk valuesnhave taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. For thousands of years,nphilosophers have said, if you think life is about money,nand status and showing off, youre going to feel like crap. Thats not an exact quotenfrom Schopenhauer, but that is the gist of what he said. But weirdly, hardy anyonenhad scientifically investigated this, until a truly extraordinary personnI got to know, named professor Tim Kasser, whos at Knox College in Illinois, and hes been researching thisn about 30 years now. And his research suggestsnseveral really important things. Firstly, the more you believe you can buy and displaynyour way out of sadness, and into a good life, the more likely you are to becomendepressed and anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have becomenmuch more driven by these beliefs. All throughout my lifetime, under the weight of advertisingnand Instagram and everything like them. And as I thought about this, I realized its like weve all been fednsince birth, a kind of KFC  the soul. Weve been trained to look  happinessnin all the wrong places, and just like junk foodndoesnt meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible, junk values dont meetnyour psychological needs, and they take you away from a good life. But when I first spent timenwith professor Kasser and I was learning all this, I felt a really weird mixture of emotions. Because on the one hand,nI found this really challenging. I could see how oftennin my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kind ofnshow-offy, grand external solution. And I could see why thatndid not work well  me. I also thought,nisnt this kind of obvious? Isnt this almost like banal, right? If I said to everyone here, none of you are going to lienon your deathbed and think about all the shoes you boughtnand all the retweets you got, youre going to think about moments of love, meaningnand connection in your life. I think that seems almost like a cliché. But I kept talkingnto professor Kasser and saying, ""Why am I feelingnthis strange doubleness?"" And he said, ""At some level,nwe all know these things. But in this culture,nwe dont live by them."" We know them so wellntheyve become clichés, but we dont live by them. I kept asking why, why would we knownsomething so profound, but not live by it? And after a while,nprofessor Kasser said to me, ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglectnwhat is important about life."" I had to really think about that. ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get usnto neglect what is important about life."" And professor Kasser wanted to figure outnif we can disrupt that machine. Hes done loads of research into this; Ill tell you about one example, and I really urge everyone herento try this with their friends and family. With a guy called Nathan Dungan,nhe got a group of teenagers and adults to come together  a series of sessionsnover a period of time, to meet up. And part of the point of the group was to get people to thinknabout a moment in their life they had actually foundnmeaning and purpose. For different people,nit was different things. For some people, it was playing ,nwriting, helping someone -- Im sure everyone herencan picture something, right? And part of the point of the groupnwas to get people to ask, ""OK, how could you dedicatenmore of your life to pursuing these momentsnof meaning and purpose, and less to, I dont know,nbuying crap you dont need, putting it on social medianand trying to get people to go, OMG, so jealous!"" And what they found was, just having these meetings, it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymousn consumerism, right? Getting people to have these meetings,narticulate these values, determine to act on themnand check in with each other, led to a marked shift in peoples values. It took them away from this hurricanenof depression-generating messages training us to seek happinessnin the wrong places, and towards more meaningfulnand nourishing values that lift us out of depression. But with all the solutions that I sawnand have written about, and many I cant talk about here, I kept thinking, you know: Why did it take me so longnto see these insights? Because when you explain them to people -- some of them are morencomplicated, but not all -- when you explain this to people,nits not like rocket science, right? At some level, we alreadynknow these things. Why do we find it so hard to understand? I think theres many reasons. But I think one reason isnthat we have to change our understanding of what depressionnand anxiety actually are. re are very realnbiological contributions to depression and anxiety. But if we allow the biologynto become the whole picture, as I did  so long, as I would argue our culturenhas done pretty much most of my life, what were implicitly saying to peoplenis, and this isnt anyones intention, but what were implicitlynsaying to people is, ""Your pain doesnt mean anything. Its just a malfunction. Its like a glitch in a computer program, its just a wiring problem in your head."" But I was only able to startnchanging my life when I realized your depressionnis not a malfunction. Its a signal. Your depression is a signal. Its telling you something. () We feel this way  reasons, and they can be hard to seenin the throes of depression -- I understand that really wellnfrom personal experience. But with the right help,nwe can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together. But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying theyre a sign of weakness,nor madness or purely biological, except  a tiny number of people. We need to startnlistening to these signals, because theyre telling usnsomething we really need to hear. Its only when we trulynlisten to these signals, and we honor these signalsnand respect these signals, that were going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing,ndeeper solutions.  cows that are waiting all around us. Thank you. ()"
30,0,"Translator: Timothy CovellnReviewer: Morton Bast  story starts:nI was at a friends house, and she had on her shelfna copy of the DSM manual, which is the manual of mental disorders. It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be, back in the 0s,na very slim pamphlet. And then it got biggernand bigger and bigger, and now its 886 pages long. And it lists currentlyn37 mental disorders. So I was leafing through it, wondering if I had any mental disorders, and it turns out Ive got 12. () Ive got generalized anxiety disorder, which is a given. Ive got nightmare disorder, which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of beingnpursued or declared a failure, and all my dreams involve peoplenchasing me down the street going, ""Youre a failure!"" () Ive got parent-child relational problems, which I blame my parents . () Im kidding. Im not kidding. Im kidding. And Ive got malingering. And I think its actually quite rare to have both malingeringnand generalized anxiety disorder, because malingering tendsnto make me feel very anxious. Anyway, I was looking through this book, wondering if I was much craziernthan I thought I was, or maybe its not a good idea to diagnosenyourself with a mental disorder if youre not a trained professional, or maybe the psychiatry professionnhas a kind of strange desire to label whats essentially normalnhuman behavior as a mental disorder. I didnt know which of these was true,nbut I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I shouldnmeet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up havingnlunch with the Scientologists. () It was a man called Brian,nwho runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroynpsychiatry wherever it lies. yre called the CCHR. And I said to him, ""Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo-sciencenthat cant be trusted?"" And he said, ""Yes,nwe can prove it to you."" And I said, ""How?"" And he said, ""Were goingnto introduce you to Tony."" And I said, ""Whos Tony?"" And he said, ""Tonys in Broadmoor."" Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the BroadmoornAsylum  the Criminally Insane. Its where they send the serial killers, and the people who cant help themselves. And I said to Brian,n""Well, what did Tony do?"" And he said, ""Hardly anything. He beat someone up or something, and he decided to fake madnessnto get out of a prison sentence. But he faked it too well,nand now hes stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe hes sane. Do you want us to try and get youninto Broadmoor to meet Tony?"" So I said, ""Yes, please."" So I got the train to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollablynaround Kempton Park, which apparently is what dogsnalso do when anxious, they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gatenafter gate after gate after gate into the wellness center, which is wherenyou get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. Its all peach and pinenand calming colors. And the only bold colorsnare the reds of the panic buttons. And the patients started drifting in. And they were quite overweightnand wearing sweatpants, and quite docile-looking. And Brian the Scientologistnwhispered to me, ""yre medicated,"" which, to the Scientologists,nis like the worst evil in the world, but Im thinkingnits probably a good idea. () And then Brian said, ""Heres Tony."" And a man was walking in. And he wasnt overweight,nhe was in very good physical shape. And he wasnt wearing sweatpants, he was wearing a pinstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of  Apprentice. He looked like a mannwho wanted to wear an outfit that would convince menthat he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said, ""So is it truenthat you faked your way in here?"" And he said, ""Yep. Yep. Absolutely.nI beat someone up when I was 17. And I was in prison awaiting trial, and my cellmate said to me, You know what you have to do? Fake madness. Tell them youre mad, youll getnsent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will bring you pizzas,nyoull have your own PlayStation."" I said, ""Well, how did you do it?"" He said, ""Well, I asked to seenthe prison psychiatrist. And Id just seen a film called Crash, in which people get sexual pleasurenfrom crashing cars into walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, I get sexual pleasurenfrom crashing cars into walls."" And I said, ""What else?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah.nI told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died, because it would makenme feel more normal."" I said, ""Whered you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from a biographynof Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library."" Anyway, he faked madnessntoo well, he said. And they didnt send himnto some cushy hospital. y sent him to Broadmoor. And the minute he got there, said he took one look at the place,nasked to see the psychiatrist, said, ""res beenna terrible misunderstanding. Im not mentally ill."" I said, ""How long have you been here ?"" He said, ""Well, if Id justndone my time in prison  the original crime,nId have got five years. Ive been in Broadmoor  12 years."" Tony said that its a lot hardernto convince people youre sane than it is to convince them youre crazy. He said, ""I thoughtnthe best way to seem normal would be to talk to peoplennormally about normal things like football or whats on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist, and recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was trainingnbumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, Did you know that the U.S. Armynis training bumblebees to sniff out explosives? When I read my medical notes,nI saw theyd written: Believes bees can sniff out explosives."" () He said, ""You know, theyre alwaysnlooking out  nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit in a sane way? How do you cross your legs in a sane way? Its just impossible."" When Tony said that to me, I thought to myself,n""Am I sitting like a journalist? Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"" He said, ""You know, Ive gotnthe Stockwell Strangler on one side of me, and Ive got the TiptoenThrough the Tulips rapist on the other side of me. So I tend to stay in my room a lotnbecause I find them quite frightening. And they take that as a sign of madness. y say it provesnthat Im aloof and grandiose."" So, only in Broadmoor would not wantingnto hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness. Anyway, he seemed completely normalnto me, but what did I know? And when I got home I emailednhis clinician, Anthony Maden. I said, ""Whats the story?"" And he said, ""Yep.nWe accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence,nbecause his hallucinations -- that had seemednquite cliche to begin with -- just vanished the minutenhe got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him, and weve determined that what he is is a psychopath."" And in fact, faking madness is exactly the kind of cunningnand manipulative act of a psychopath. Its on the checklist:ncunning, manipulative. So, faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brainnhas gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts, and they said the pinstripensuit -- classic psychopath -- speaks to items onenand two on the checklist: glibness, superficial charmnand grandiose sense of self-worth. And I said, ""Well, but why didntnhe hang out with the other patients?"" Classic psychopath -- it speaksnto grandiosity and also lack of empathy. So all the things that had seemednmost normal about Tony was evidence, according to his clinician, that he was mad in this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clinician said to me, ""If younwant to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopath-spotting course run by Robert Hare, who inventednthe psychopath checklist."" So I did. I went on a psychopath-spotting course, and I am now a certified -- and I have to say, extremely adept --npsychopath spotter. So, heres the statistics: One in a hundred regular peoplenis a psychopath. So theres 1,00 people in his room. Fifteen of you are psychopaths. Although that figure rises to four percentnof CEOs and business leaders, so I think theres a very good chance theres about 30 or 0npsychopaths in this room. It could be carnagenby the end of the night. () Hare said the reason whynis because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy, the glibness, cunning, manipulative. In fact, capitalism, perhapsnat its most remorseless, is a physical manifestationnof psychopathy. Its like a m of psychopathynthats come down to affect us all. Hare said, ""You know what?nForget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares? Thats not a big story.  big story,"" he said,n""is corporate psychopathy. You want to go and interview yourselfnsome corporate psychopaths."" So I gave it a try.nI wrote to the Enron people. I said, ""Could I comenand interview you in prison, to find out it youre psychopaths?"" () And they didnt reply. () So I changed tack. I emailed ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percentnof the workce, just turn American towns into ghost towns. And I emailed him and I said, ""I believe you may havena very special brain anomaly that makes you ... special, and interested in the predatorynspirit, and fearless. Can I come and interview younabout your special brain anomaly?"" And he said, ""Come on over!"" () So I went to Al Dunlapsngrand Florida mansion. It was filled with sculpturesnof predatory animals. re were lions and tigers --nhe was taking me through the garden -- there were falcons and eagles, he was saying, ""Over therenyouve got sharks and --"" he was saying thisnin a less effeminate way -- ""Youve got more sharksnand youve got tigers."" It was like Narnia. () And then we went into his kitchen. Now, Al Dunlap would be brought innto save failing companies, hed close down 30 percentnof the workce. And hed quite oftennfire people with a joke. Like,  instance,none famous story about him, somebody came up to him and said,n""Ive just bought myself a new car."" And he said, ""Well,nyou may have a new car, but Ill tell you what youndont have -- a job."" So in his kitchen -- he was in there with his wife, Judy,nand his bodyguard, Sean -- and I said, ""You knownhow I said in my email that you might have a special brainnanomaly that makes you special?"" He said, ""Yeah, its an amazingntheory, its like Star Trek. Youre going wherenno man has gone bee."" And I said, ""Well --"" (Clears throat) () Some psychologists might say that this makes you --""n(Mumbles) () And he said, ""What?"" And I said, ""A psychopath."" And I said, ""Ive got a listnof psychopathic traits in my pocket. Can I go through them with you?"" And he looked intrigued despite himself, and he said, ""Okay, go on."" And I said, ""Okay.nGrandiose sense of self-worth."" Which I have to say, wouldnhave been hard  him to deny, because he was standingnunder a giant oil painting of himself. () He said, ""Well, youvengot to believe in you!"" And I said, ""Manipulative."" He said, ""Thats leadership."" () And I said, ""Shallow affect, an inability to experiencena range of emotions."" He said, ""Who wants to be weighedndown by some nonsense emotions?"" So he was going downnthe psychopath checklist, basically turning itninto ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" () But I did notice something happeningnto me the day I was with Al Dunlap. Whenever he said anything to menthat was kind of normal -- like he said ""no"" to juvenile delinquency, he said he got accepted into West Point, and they dont letndelinquents in West Point. He said ""no"" to many short-termnmarital relationships. Hes only ever been married twice. Admittedly, his first wifencited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wonderednwhat human flesh tasted like, but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriagesnin the heat of an argument, and his second marriagenhas lasted 1 years. So whenever he said anything to menthat just seemed kind of non-psychopathic, I thought to myself, well Im notngoing to put that in my book. And then I realized thatnbecoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned mena little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove himnin a box marked ""Psychopath."" I was desperate to define himnby his maddest edges. And I realized, my God -- this is what Ive been doing  20 years. Its what all journalists do. We travel across the worldnwith our notepads in our hands, and we wait  the gems. And the gems are alwaysnthe outermost aspects of our interviewees personality. And we stitch them togethernlike medieval monks, and we leave the normalnstuff on the floor. And you know, this is a countrynthat over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar -- children as young as fournare being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them highnon the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London, Tony phoned me. He said, ""Why havent younbeen returning my calls?"" I said, ""Well, they saynthat youre a psychopath."" And he said, ""Im not a psychopath."" He said, ""You know what? One of the items on the checklistnis lack of remorse, but another item on the checklistnis cunning, manipulative. So when you say you feelnremorse  your crime, they say, Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feelsnremorse when he doesnt. Its like witchcraft, they turnneverything upside-down."" He said, ""Ive got a tribunal coming up. Will you come to it?"" So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after 1 yearsnin Broadmoor, they let him go. y decided that he shouldntnbe held indefinitely because he scores highnon a checklist that might mean that he would have a greaternthan average chance of recidivism. So they let him go. And outside in the corridor he said to me, ""You know what, Jon? Everyones a bit psychopathic."" He said, ""You are, I am.nWell, obviously I am."" I said, ""What are you going to do now?"" He said, ""Im going to go to Belgium. res a woman there that I fancy. But shes married, so Im going to havento get her split up from her husband."" () Anyway, that was two years ago, and thats where my book ended. And  the last 20 months,neverything was fine. Nothing bad happened. He was living with a girl outside London. He was, accordingnto Brian the Scientologist, making up  lost time,nwhich I know sounds ominous, but isnt necessarily ominous. Untunately, after 20 months, he did go back to jail  a month. He got into a ""fracas""nin a bar, he called it. Ended up going to jail  a month,nwhich I know is bad, but at least a month impliesnthat whatever the fracas was, it wasnt too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what, I thinknits right that Tony is out. Because you shouldnt definenpeople by their maddest edges. And what Tony is,nis hes a semi-psychopath. Hes a gray area in a worldnthat doesnt like gray areas. But the gray areasnare where you find the complexity. Its where you find the humanity, and its where you find the truth. And Tony said to me, ""Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar? I just want to thank youn everything youve done  me."" And I didnt go. What would you have done? Thank you. ()"
31,0,"Okay, now I dont wantnto alarm anybody in this room, but its just come to my attentionnthat the person to your right is a liar. () Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sittingnin your very seats is a liar. Were all liars. What Im going to do today is Im going to show you what the researchnsays about why were all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might wantnto go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrotenthis book, ""Liespotting,"" no one wants to meet me in personnanymore, no, no, no, no, no. y say, ""Its okay, well email you."" () I cant even getna coffee date at Starbucks. My husbands like, ""Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.nHow about French cooking?"" So bee I get started,nwhat Im going to do is Im going to clarify my goal  you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters arent those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the roomnthat are shouting, ""Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.nYou flared your nostril. I watch that TV show Lie To Me.nI know youre lying."" No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledgenof how to spot deception. y use it to get to the truth, and they do what maturenleaders do everyday; they have difficult conversationsnwith difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that pathnby accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no powernwhatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agreesnto believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some pointnyou got lied to, its because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:nLyings a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes were willingnparticipants in deception  the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that shouldnbe kept secret, secret. We say, ""Nice song."" ""Honey, you dont look fat in that, no."" Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, ""You know, I just fishednthat email out of my Spam folder. So sorry."" But there are times when we are unwillingnparticipants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs  us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alonenin the United States. Thats an eyelashnunder a trillion dollars. Thats seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the casenof double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,nthey can undermine democracy, they can cause the deathsnof those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,nhe was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entirenbanking system of the Western world. And you cant find this guy on Google;nyou cant find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,nand he said the following. He said, ""Look, Ive got one rule."" And this was Henrys rule, he said, ""Look, everyone is willingnto give you something. yre ready to give you somethingn whatever it is theyre hungry ."" And thats the crux of it. If you dont want to bendeceived, you have to know, what is it that youre hungry ? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we werenbetter husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,nhow we wish we could be, with what were really like. And boy are we willing to fill innthose gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies shownthat you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutesnof meeting each other. () Now when we first hearnthis data, we recoil. We cant believe how prevalent lying is. Were essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,nthe plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangersnthan we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselvesnthan they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If youre an average married couple, youre going to lie to your spousenin one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think thats bad. If youre unmarried,nthat number drops to three. Lyings complex. Its woven into the fabricnof our daily and our business lives. Were deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes  very good reasons, other times just becausenwe dont understand the gaps in our lives. Thats truth number two about lying. Were against lying, but were covertly  it in ways that our society has sanctionedn centuries and centuries and centuries. Its as old as breathing. Its part of our culture,nits part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,nthe Bible,  of the World. () Lying has evolutionary valuento us as a species. Researchers have long knownnthat the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorillanwho was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicatenvia sign language. Heres Koko with her kitten. Its her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kittenn ripping a sink out of the wall. () Were hardwired to becomenleaders of the pack. Its starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see whos coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. () Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. y manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, youre going to lie to your momnin one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work worldnand were breadwinners, we enter a world that is just clutterednwith Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author callsna post-truth society. Its been very confusingn a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can takento navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truthn90 percent of the time.  rest of us,nwere only  percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? re are good liars and bad liars. re are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.nWe all use the same techniques. So what Im going to do is Im goingnto show you two patterns of deception. And then were goingnto look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. Were going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:nI want you to listen to me. Im going to say this again. I did not have sexual relationsnwith that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,nnot a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to workn the American people. Thank you. () Pamela Meyer: Okay,nwhat were the telltale signs? Well first we heard whats knownnas a non-contracted denial. Studies show that peoplenwho are overdetermined in their denial will resort to mal rathernthan inmal language. We also heardndistancing language: ""that woman."" We know that liars will unconsciouslyndistance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,n""Well, to tell you the truth ..."" or Richard Nixons favorite,n""In all candor ..."" he would have been a dead giveaway  any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as its called,nqualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeatednthe question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his accountnwith a little too much detail -- and were all really gladnhe didnt do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,ntheres much more to it than speech: ""No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,nhe chatters with his fingertips."" And we all do it no matternhow powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. Im going to show younDominique Strauss-Kahn with  whos chattering with his fingertips. () Now this brings us to our next pattern,nwhich is body language. With body language,nheres what youve got to do. Youve really got to just thrownyour assumptions out the door. Let the science tempernyour knowledge a little bit. Because we think liarsnfidget all the time. Well guess what, theyre known to freezentheir upper bodies when theyre lying. We think liars wont look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they looknyou in the eyes a little too much just to compensate  that myth. We think warmth and smilesnconvey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotterncan spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contractnthe muscles in your cheeks. But the real smiles in the eyes,nthe crows feet of the eyes. y cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Dont overdo the Botox;nnobody will think youre honest. Now were going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell whats happeningnin a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someones wordsnand someones actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when youre having a conversationnwith someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlookednbut telling of indicators. An honest personnis going to be cooperative. yre going to showntheyre on your side. yre going to be enthusiastic. yre going to be willing and helpfulnto getting you to the truth. yre going to be willingnto brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. yre going to say, ""Hey, maybe it was those guys in payrollnthat ged those checks."" yre going to be infuriatednif they sense theyre wrongly accused throughout the entire coursenof the interview, not just in flashes; theyll be infuriated throughoutnthe entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happennto whomever did ge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rathernthan lenient punishment. Now lets say youre havingnthat exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive personnto tell their story, theyre going to pepper itnwith way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then theyre going to tell their storynin strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle waysnover the course of several hours, they will ask that personnto tell that story backwards, and then theyll watch them squirm, and track which questions producenthe highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?nWell, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say ""yes,"" we shake our heads ""no."" We tell very convincing stories,nwe slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delightnin getting away with it. Now, that smile is knownnin the trade as ""duping delight."" And were going to see thatnin several videos moving ward, but were going to start --n those of you who dont know him, this is presidentialncandidate John Edwards who shocked America by fatheringna child out of wedlock. Were going to see him talknabout getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot himnsaying, ""yes"" while shaking his head ""no,"" slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: Id be happynto participate in one. I know that its not possiblenthat this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know its not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,nand would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to donthat soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, Im only one side.nIm only one side of the test. But Im happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakesnare much easier to spot once you know to look  them. re are going to be timesnwhen someone makes one expression while masking another that justnkind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partnernmight shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with younand then leak an expression of anger. And were not all going to becomenfacial expression experts overnight here, but theres one I can teach younthats very dangerous and its easy to learn, and thats the expression of contempt. Now with anger, youve gotntwo people on an even playing field. Its still somewhatnof a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,nyouve been dismissed. Its associated with moral superiority. And  that reason, its very,nvery hard to recover from. Heres what it looks like. Its marked by one lip cornernpulled up and in. Its the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,nwhether or not deception follows -- and it doesnt always follow -- look the other way,ngo the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, ""No thank you. Im not coming upn just one more nightcap. Thank you."" Science has surfacednmany, many more indicators. We know,  example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. y will take barrier objects and put them between themselvesnand the person that is interviewing them. yll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now heres the deal. se behaviors are just behaviors. yre not proof of deception. yre red flags. Were human beings. We make deceptive flailing gesturesnall over the place all day long. y dont mean anythingnin and of themselves. But when you see clustersnof them, thats your signal. Look, listen, probe,nask some hard questions, get out of that very comtablenmode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,nask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the personnyoure talking to with rapport. Dont try to be like those folksnon ""Law & Order"" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjectsninto submission. Dont be too aggressive, it doesnt work. Now, weve talked a little bitnabout how to talk to someone whos lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, were now goingnto look at what the truth looks like. But Im going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,none is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researchernDavid Matsumoto in Calinia. And I think theyre an excellent examplenof what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospitalnwhile they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And youll see when you see the video, she cant even pretendnto be an agonizing mother. What you want to look  herenis an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describesnand her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, youll seenduping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:nAt night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reachingnher hand out to me while Im driving, and the blood just keptncoming out of her mouth. And that -- maybenitll fade too with time -- but I dont think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now Im going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,nErin Runnion, confronting her daughters murderernand torturer in court. Here youre going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expressionnof a mothers agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:nI wrote this statement on the third anniversarynof the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at younwith those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I dont understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, theres no doubtingnthe veracity of those emotions. Now the technologynaround what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know,  example, that we now have specialized eye trackersnand infrared brain scans, MRIs that can decode the signalsnthat our bodies send out when were trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are goingnto be marketed to all of us as panaceas  deceit, and they will provenincredibly useful some day. But youve got to ask yourselfnin the meantime: Who do you want on your sidenof the meeting, someone whos trainednin getting to the truth or some guy whos going to dragna 00-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. y know, as someone once said, ""Characters who you are in the dark."" And whats kind of interestingnis that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 2 hours a day. Its transparentnwith blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzznof a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to liventheir lives in public. Its a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, thats not honesty. Our manic tweeting and textingncan blind us to the fact that the subtletiesnof human decency -- character integrity -- thats still what matters,nthats always whats going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense  us to be just a little bit more explicitnabout our moral code. When you combine the sciencenof recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourselfnfrom collaborating in a lie. You start up that pathnof being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, ""Hey, my world, our world,nits going to be an honest one. My world is going to benone where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognizednand marginalized."" And when you do that, the ground around you startsnto shift just a little bit. And thats the truth. Thank you. ()"
32,0,"Transcriber: Yoshie AsaharanReviewer: Tanya Cushman About seven years ago, I saw this photo of myself and decided that I had to do something about this thing. So I ate less food,nmoved around a bit more, and lo and behold, this happened. I lost 16 kilograms. And youre probably wondering, How did he do it? But I was wondering, Where did the 16 kilograms go? And Ive been infatuatednwith this question ever since. I ended up publishing a paper about itnin the British Medical , very brief paper - 80 words, two figures. And then, I published a book about it,nwhich was no bestseller because it told you that you had to eat lessnand move more to lose weight. No one wants to hear that. But its now a first-year subjectnat the University of New South Wales, and so I better explain that I did not figure outnwhere fat goes when you lose weight. That was done a long time ago. In fact, heres some time posts  you. When Captain Cook sailednpast Bundaberg in 1770, we didnt know what happens to fatnwhen you lose weight. But when the First Fleetnsailed into Sydney Cove, we did know the answer, and it was all figured outnby this bloke in between. His names Antoine Lavoisier. He figured out that respirationnis a combustion. You turn food intoncarbon dioxide and water. And in the process, nothing is lost. Nothing is created. Everything is just transmed. And so, what did I do? Well, when I lost weight and I firstnthought about this, I was so infatuated. I wanted to know if I lose 10 kilos, wherendoes the 10 kilos go precisely? And it took me months to figure this out. But it turns out thatnwhen you lose weight, 8. kilos out of every 10ncomes out of your lungs, which I think is the best factnIve ever heard, so I gave - youve got to add oxygen to do this,nso you cant do it (snap) like that. It takes a while. So I gave a talk about this at xQUTna long time ago now, and then I did a storyn ABC TV Catalyst, and I met this fellow, nProfessor Andrew Brown, who teaches biochemistry. And I showed him my calculations, and he said, ""Thats pretty interesting. Lets try and get that published."" And so he helped me get itninto the British Medical . And the other thing we did was we surveyed 10 doctors,ndieticians and personal trainers and asked them what they thought. And heres the thing: what they think happens is impossible. You cant turn fat into energy,nbecause its made of atoms. And you would need antimatter atomsnto annihilate them. So thats literally impossible. And since then,nIve realised, well, hang on, this is part of a much bigger gapnin health literacy. Ive asked literally thousandsnof kids this question: When you breathe in,nwhat are you inhaling? Oxygen. And what are you exhaling? Carbon dioxide. What they dont realisenis that theyre breathing in atoms, and two go in, but three come out. And its this atom herenthat is the gap in health literacy. Its also the secret to weight loss because it means that your exhaled breathnis heavier than your inhaled breath. And when you ask around,nso few people know this. Well, have a listen to these people: (Audio) Ruben Meerman: Whatsnthe gas that you inhale in out of the air that keeps you alive called? Oxygen. Oxygen. RM: And whats the gas you breathe outnbecause youre alive? Carbon dioxide? Carbon dioxide? RM: Now third question. Where did the carbon atomsnin the carbon dioxide come from? Oh ... I dont know. (Chuckle) No idea. Ive got no idea. I wouldnt have a clue, mate. Ooh, ahhhh. Ummmm, wow! Good question. I should have concentratednmore in chemistry. So where do carbon atoms come from? Or ... Umm, pollution? Fumes? Gas? Cars and stuff? I dont know. Yeah. Vehicles. Dont know. Cow poop? () Should know, but dont know. So to be somewhere in the body, right? Out of my lungs. My lungs? From the environment? From your blood stream? From living things? Maybe from the blood? From plants? My chemistry days are over.nIve got nothing. From the food we eat? RM: You know that! You got there! Really? So you eat it. RM: Yeah We eat it? From what? RM: Have you heard of carbohydrates? Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, OK. RM: What do you thinknthe carbo bit means? Carbon dioxide. Probably carbon dioxide?nDoes it connect to somewhere? Like carbon and hydrogennand oxygen together? RM: Yes! Carbon - carbohydrate, yeah. Its not the same word. Never thought. Its C-H-A.nCarbon-hydrogen. OK, interesting. RM: What do you do  a crust? Im a PDH PE teacher. (Onstage) This is not a gapnin health literacy. This is a gaping black holenin health literacy. And the amazing thing is we supposedlynlearned all this stuff at school. We learned all the dots, but no one evernteaches you how to connect them. So the word carbohydrates is the big clue, and thats because it standsn carbon atoms that have been hydrated by - well, if youre dehydrated,nyou need to drink water. And water has a chemical mula,nwhich stands  a bunch of atoms. So where do these carbohydratesnthat you eat come from? I mean what is this stuff? And it all starts in plants. So Step 1 in making carbohydratesnis plants suck water out of the soil. y take the water molecules, stick it into a moleculencalled chlorophyll, youve all heard of. It takes a photon of sunlightnto zap that bond and zap that bond, and now we have the atoms free. You do that twice, and youve got enough atoms nownto make an oxygen molecule, which is the waste productnof photosynthesis. And by the way, you breathe that stuff. So every oxygen molecule you inhalencame from two water molecules. Step 2 is to take carbon dioxidenout of the air into the leaf, and into a chemical process,nwhich is called the Calvin Cycle. And if you get six carbon atomsnand stick them together, you can make glucose, which is the most importantncarbohydrate in the cosmos. If you rearrange those atoms,nthen you can make fructose, which is what sugarcane does, which I have a stalk of over there, and if you stick it in sunlight, it will turn carbon dioxidenand water into sugar. If you stick glucose to fructose, you get table sugar, and if you stick galactose to glucose, you get another famous disaccharide. Its called lactose. If youre lactose intolerant, you cant break the bonds betweennthis oxygen atom and its neighbours. So all of this stuff is understandablenif you know about atoms, and it all starts in plants. But you dont just eat carbohydrates. So heres everything that you eat, all the macronutrients. Weve looked at carbs. Heres fats.  three most commonnfatty acids in nature? palmitic acid gets its name from palm oil, oleic from olive oil. res only three atoms there though. Three kinds. Three elements. And if you stick those three fatty acidsnto a glycerin molecule, youll make a triglyceride. This is what olive oil is; this is what every fat in nature is. Its the fat in your fat cellsnthat you want to lose if youre trying to lose weight. And when you burn it, what youre really doing is turning itninto carbon dioxide and water. You call it metabolism. People say theyre burning fat. It means youre turning itninto carbon dioxide and water. And theres two ways to do it.  main highway is callednthe beta oxidation pathway, but theres another wayncalled the ketogenic pathway, and the low-carb peoplenwill be all over this. Its taking fatty acids and turning themninto smaller molecules - acetyl acetate - which can thennbe turned into acetone, and beta hydroxybutarate. But the point is you still add oxygen and it still turnsninto carbon dioxide and water, so it doesnt matternwhat kind of diet youre on. If youre burning fat,nyoure turning it into CO2 and H2O. And alcohols madenof the same three atoms. Proteins an interesting one. Its made out of 20 kinds of amino acids, but theres only two more kinds of atoms. So  all their complexity,ntheres only five elements. And if you eat them -nwell, lets take a look. Because to make a human,nyou need those 20 amino acids. All the protein in naturenis made out of these 20 amino acids. A baby, a human, is 60% water, 16% protein, 19% fatnand % a bit of other stuff. And when you burn protein, if you eat a lot of it,nyou cant store it. So youll burn it, and youll turn itninto carbon dioxide and water, a bit of urea and some sulfate. Those two things will end upnin the toilet via your bladder, and now you knownwhere everything that you eat goes. You might be wondering, though, ""Im eating carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. Whats all this talk about diets?"" Amazingly, this junk diet is also madenof nothing but carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, but youre not gettingnmany vitamins and minerals. So lets take a look at those. Heres all 1 vitaminsnthat you need to eat. If you dont eat them, youll get scurvy,nberiberi rickets - youll go blind. But the amazing thing is per day, you only neednabout half a gram of this stuff.  1 elements that you have to take,nwe call them minerals. Here they are. se are the recommended daily intakes, and if you stick all that together,nits seven grams worth of stuff. Its not very much. Thats why we call them micronutrients. So when I tell people this, the first question I get asked isn""So what? I just have to breathe more?"" And theyll start hyperventilating. () So lets talk about breathing. Talk to anyone who works in an ICU unit, and theyll tell you that a humannwhos lying perfectly still needs 3. millilitres of oxygen, and 2.6 to 2.9 millilitres of CO2nwill come out of them per kilogram of that person. Now, I weigh 72 kilos, so that means I need aboutn22 millilitres of oxygen just to stay alive. Thats 1 litres per hour, and over here,nI have an hours worth of breathing. This is how much air I have to breathe just to get that one balloon of oxygenninto my bloodstream. A balloon is about 1 litres. So thats how much oxygen I need per hournjust to stay awake and alive - not awake, sorry - I mean alive. Its my resting metabolic rate. And in that hour, when I breathenall this air back out again, itll have a balloon worth of CO2 in it, and these numbers just get betternand better and better. If you add up all the carbonnatoms in that much CO2, its 136 to 11 grams a daynof just carbon. Its about a kilo a week. Its about 9 to  kilos a year. If you want to lose weight,ndont eat that much carbon back in. Thats the whole keynto breathing yourself thin. Doctors will - if you are not breathing,nthey will monitor your breathing. If youre having an operation, the anaesthetistnwill look  your breaths. This is how much CO2nthere should be in your breath. If you hyperventilate,nyour body is not producing more CO2. Youre just breathing outnmore than you need to, and so this will happen. Youre pumping outnmore than youre making; the amount in your body will go down. Its called hypocapnia. It will lead to a loss of consciousnessnif you do it  too long. And some people ask me: ""What about peoplenwho have COPD or emphysema? Could they get overweightnbecause they cant get rid of enough CO2?"" Well, they cant do the Calvin Cycle - a plant can - so you cant turn the CO2nthat youre not breathing out back into fat. Its impossible. So, you know, theres a lotnof misconceptions about this business. Now, it takes a while to breathe outnthe carbon that you eat. So lets have a look at how much carbonnyou can put in really quickly. I quite like this stuff, and there is a lot of sugarnin lemon-flavoured soft drink. Its one of the highest. So, how much sugar are we talking about? Well, one stick is 3 grams, so theres 23nand a third of a stick in there, which looks like this. And if you want to turn that much sugarninto carbon dioxide and water, well, its going to take a while. Youre going to need to breathe innthat much oxygen. Youll make that much CO2. How much is that?nIts four balloons worth. And its four balloons worth of CO2. So, how long is it going to take mento breathe out that much carbon? Its going to take me four hours because I only breathe out one balloonnof carbon dioxide per hour if I stay still, but if I go  a walk,nIll breathe it out in an hour. If I run, itll only take me 30 minutes. Thats why they say eat less, move more. Because when youre moving more,nyoure breathing more. And theres always CO2 in your breath. What about if we compare itnto something a bit healthier? Because this has got vitaminsnand amino acids and all the good stuff in it. But if we take those ingredients, and we chuck it ninto the equation  food, then you discover that, actually,nits four hours as well. And so is this tuna salad sandwichnon organic wholemeal bread, grown on the north side of the hill,nblessed by a monk, all the things. () But its still four hours nof breathing, right? So the point is theyre not equivalentnin how healthy they are, but they are equivalentnin how long they take to exhale. An apple takes an hour; a fun size chocolate bar,nan hour, 10 minutes; regular size, 3. hours;nand a king-sized, .2. If youre trying to lose weight,ndont drink soft drink, because thats got carbon atoms in it. Drink water. If you like this stuff -nand who doesnt? - a large coffee and a piece of cake. Thats 10 hours of breathing between breakfast and lunch. So be careful. A large, lovely burgernlike this guy - 7 hours. Have a large fries with it, 13 hours; large drink, 16 hours; bang in a large sundae -nits a whole day worth of breathing. You can see whyntheres an obesity epidemic, but no one knows what reallynis going on in their body. So, usually, we talk aboutncalories in, calories out. Hows this inmation going to help you? Well, I would like to talk aboutnatoms in, atoms out. And when youre counting calories,nyoure actually counting carbon atoms because the energy in food is wherever you see a carbonnand a hydrogen atom stuck together. And its in all food. So just - and its sunlightnthat put that there. So my project that I really want to get upnand running here at Bundaberg is lets teach your children this, and you can do it. Little kids love learning about atoms. Adults freak out at the idea. But little kids absolutely love it. This is Ithaca CreeknState School in Brisbane. This is a school in India, and these kids are using amino,nand theyre making amino acids and sticking them togethernto build a protein. You can do that with amazing resourcenthat my friend Ian Stewart invented. yre called ""sticky atoms"". Hes a retired physicsnand chemistry teacher. He taught in Brisbane. y have magnetic bondsnso three-year-olds, even younger, can play with these thingsnand learn about atoms. And  the educators in the room, they conm to the concretenpictorial abstract way of teaching. Its a fantastic pedagogy, and Ian and I are hoping to work together. We took this out backstage,njust moments ago. Because what we want to donis teach children whats actually going on in their bodies. And you cant do that if youre not talking aboutnthe atoms that theyre made of. Untunately, the curriculum does not introducenthe concept of atoms and molecules until kids are in Grade 9, and they dont see the periodic tablenuntil theyre in Grade 10. Why? Because a fellow called Jean Piaget,nwho was kind of a contemporary of Freud. He thought that kidsncant have these abstract thoughts until theyre about 1. We dont use Freuds psychology anymore. We still learn it, but we dont use it. But our curriculum is still under the spellnof a person who died long ago, whose ideas about education were, well,nsomeone had to have those ideas, but they were wrong. So I hope to see what happensnif kids grow up with this knowledge. In 10 years, what do obesity ratesnlook like in a town like Bundaberg if all the children learn thisnat primary school? Will they grow up to accept the advice that to lose weight, just eat less,nmove more and keep breathing? Thank you. ()"
33,0,[] right well I might get myself into a position here and on the red carpet I dont think I need to introduce myself do I but this is the last talk  the day we will have a little bit of wrap up after this and we will have a little time to to reflect and maybe some questions I know some of you will want to get home but lets get cracking because weve got about well probably 12 minutes is my talk maybe might go  1 so dont panic if that thing goes over so here we go the mathematics of weight loss well let me start with this last year I went surfing in Fiji and the resort had a photographer following us around taking all these photos which was really great except that I couldnt help but notice this somehow Id managed to become  kilograms overweight couldnt believe my eyes so I did what they tell you to do I ate less and I moved more and within just three months I discovered Id lost 6 kilograms so then I did what a normal person does I did physics but anyone would do this I graphed my weight and when I did the linear regression I discovered that lo and behold on average Id been losing 8 grams a day which got me thinking in fact it got me very curious about this question that Ive since discovered most people have no clue about in fact theyve never even thought about this and to prove my point Ive made a little video on Bondi Beach and the question was this when somebody loses weight where does it go what does it become how does it get out of your body youre probably dumbstruck by the question these people were so listen to this where does it go where does the weight go well well I dont know I dont know that I dont know the mysteries of science it gets used up the universe another dimension doesnt go anywhere it comes over to me becomes nothing dont exist anymore I guess thats a very good question question what it fascinating question what would you say it goes right in the crapper mate sweat moisture and sweat evaporates up a Bondi Beach thats where I go well basically you burn it up as energy darkness is energy heat energy burnt in energy yeah you got me there Im not quite sure mmm so what the heck is going on were in the middle of an obesity epidemic I dont need to tell you about it so why dont these people know the answer to this fundamental question because not one of them was right and we do know the answer this is not groundbreaking stuff Im about to tell you so let me just remind you of a few things you do know whats the chemical mula  water h2o chemical mula  carbon dioxide you all know it right so you know what human fat is made of so what is the chemical mula  human fat there is such a thing believe it or not its been known since the 60s its C  H 10 oh six thats the chemical mula  the average fat molecule in a human body some of the molecules might have a few more carbon atoms and a few more hydrogen some might have less they all have just six oxygen atoms thats very important and helpful  later but this is the average fat molecule hate c hate 10 oh six so lets be very clear about this the difference between that and that is C  H 1 Oh 06 I kid you not the difference between that and that same thing c h1 Oh 06 so how does this stuff get out of a human body well heres the general equation looks pretty sort of interesting slightly complicated not if youve done some year 10 chemistry surely this is year 10 chemistry although well its not really but heres what it says fat plus oxygen gives you carbon dioxide and water thats what it becomes and this biochemist have known this  ages you inhale that you exhale that thats what happens to it amazing now that little arrow there is kind of oversimplifying something called biochemistry thats three years at university and my apologies to the biochemist so that men doubt oversimplify but Im trying to get to the crunch its really complicated it doesnt just come out of you  no reason youve got to do stuff eat less move more what well come to that in a minute but look when you want to lose weight you want to lose kilograms thats all kilograms all that stuff there so what do people say heat it burns up as energy because thats what weve been telling them all this time and its very confusing because energy has different units kilojoules or you might use calories and yes thats heat thats motion when you move or its thinking your brain needs energy or its growing but thats not where the fat goes so what are we talking about here well let me just show you a couple more things so Ive got some carbon dioxide here in its frozen m we call it dry ice its carbon dioxide it has mass thing is youre not used to seeing it but heres some dry ice and its heavy and if you put it in water lo and behold it does this cool thing in bubbles like youve all seen that bee well thats carbon dioxide in water thats what fat is kind of made out of but its not fat Im not making fat that is not fat so how does that become fat well it doesnt just like that it becomes sugar first plants make fat well they start the whole thing a plant takes six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water uses an amazing chemical called chlorophyll holds them together and then sunlight comes in and finds those molecules together and it becomes sugar c6h12o6 is glucose fructose same mula c6h12o6 sucrose is glucose plus fructose stuck together - and h2o molecule so its do the maths c20 no 12h 220 right well here some this is sucrose plants make it and its this stuff joined together its now got chemical energy holding these molecules together so they dont just fly around like that and by the way if you drink that 600 mil of lemon flavored soft drink youll get 17 teaspoons of this stuff are in there Ill just quickly show what that looks like heres 1 2 3   6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 1 16 17 right so if you drink that its the equivalent of doing what I just did with the spoon except munching it all down exactly the same no difference so if you do do that then what happens well let me explain something else that Ive been telling kids  a little while and they get this so when you eat food its not in your body straight away if you swallow that sugar its not in you yet so heres a pool noodle right its got a hole running through it and heres an almond and if we put the almond in there can go all the way through and out the other end whoop-dee-doo heres another almond if I put an almond in here is wheres the almond you would say the almonds in the pool noodle okay but is it in the foam that the pool noodle is made of no of course not its just in the hole that runs through it thats food you swallow food its not in you its in the hole that runs from here to the back door and getting food into you its called digestion so with this stuff youve got to break the bond thats holding the fructose to the glucose and as soon as you do that then that stuff can cross the barrier or internal skin and into your body and then it can go around in your blood thats digestion but now its not metabolism yet its got to go into your cells and then youve got to burn it up and if you dont burn it up if you eat all that sugar after youve had your three meals in the day your body doesnt waste it doesnt come out here the stuff that comes out the back door was never in you apart from a few molecules of cholesterol its just fiber that you couldnt digest plus the bacteria that live in your gut you lose about 00 billion of those in one single sitting theyre tiny thats many times the population of the earth every time you flush the toilet its amazing but that stuff was never really in you so heres what happens if you dont then metabolize that sugar well then its going to get converted into the stuff that we all have a problem with fat now better just prove that you do breathe breathe this stuff out right if you metabolize sugar you turn it back into carbon dioxide and water so every time you exhale out comes a bit of carbon dioxide you cant see it this is the problem this is why people dont know how you lose weight so there you go of traps and breath Ive inhaled that % of the air in there is now carbon dioxide because its come out of my lungs Ive got some liquid nitrogen here and Im going to use that to freeze this air liquid nitrogen is minus 196 very handy um where did I write that in fact Ill just pour it straight on so be a little bit careful with this stuff I use it all the time if I look a little blase I dont mean to its please respect this stuff if you play with it the way you would respect boiling hot water now if you pour it onto a balloon the balloon does not pop which is incredible the nitrogen is minus 196 oxygen turns into a liquid at minus 183 so the oxygen in the balloon is turning into liquid carbon dioxide turns solid Ive got a big bowl of it there but it turns solid at minus 78 so in the balloon now I have frozen well I have liquefied oxygen and frozen carbon dioxide Im gonna take it out youll see them so Ill just take a while  the balloon to go a little bit clear at the top the nitrogen in here air is 79% nitrogen the nitrogen is in the top of the balloon but now look at that liquid down there can you see that thats the oxygen from my breath that I hadnt used but once its all gone therell be some white powder left right the white powder is breakfast thats the carbon dioxide the carbon atoms I ate in the last 2 hours and when I blow on them they get warm enough to turn back into gas and they vanish and people think theres nothing in the balloon the balloon has mass those atoms have mass you can see carbon dioxide has mass when you solidified but when you breathe it out you dont see it and weve been confusing people by talking about kilojoules or calories and theyre really important but people do not seem to understand that when you lose weight youre losing atoms you cant just turn atoms into nothing in fact science teachers out there you need to change the way you teach chemistry because those people and many in this room think that you can turn atoms into energy well its one of the founding principles of modern chemistry you cannot turn an atom into pure energy its called the conservation of mass bee a reaction and after a reaction we teach kids youve got to have the same number of atoms its called stoichiometry well we havent been teaching it very well at all because people think you can turn fat which is kilograms into nothing or just kilojoules cant do it so he was my big fat question Im a physicist I knew that bit but my question was if Ive got 10 kilograms of this stuff then how much carbon dioxide does that become and how much water and turns out that thats really simple - this is year 10 chemistry and year 10 maths you need the periodic table of elements you have to look up hydrogen carbon and oxygen there they are now the periodic table has some important inmation on it the weight of a single atom of these elements so the weight of a single atom of carbon is twelve point zero zero one zero one one atomic mass units doesnt matter what they are in kilograms just yet Ill show you why in a minute weve got  of those in a average fat molecule so theres six hundred sixty point five nine what about the hydrogen okay theres a hundred and four of those so we have in one molecule of fat 10 point eight three atomic mass units okay great the oxygen is a little trickier this stumped me  quite some time in fact I rang around and I couldnt get a very clear answer on this because it doesnt seem that many biochemists have thought about it this way thats not because theyre silly or whatever they just havent thought about it in this way which really surprised me because this bit of inmation is the most motivating bit of inmation I had in my personal little journey of losing seventeen kilograms in six months its all gone breathe it out amazing you could anyone can do this its not hard so how much carbon dioxide and water well the oxygen is important theres six atoms of it in a molecule but what are they going to become are they gonna go out as carbon dioxide are they gonna go as water are they going some ratio of the two how do you figure this out took me ages and then the answer turned up in a very old paper from the 190s where theyd taken water labelled the oxygen atoms made them put some an isotope of oxygen on to those and oxygen 18 gave it to mice the mice had it go in their belly but then it came out in their breath so water had the oxygen in it but then that oxygen turned up in the exhaled breath which showed that oxygen atoms are exchanged between carbon dioxide molecules and water molecules theres a really good reason  that heres some phenylthaline in water its a bit hard to pronounce its got a bit murky because Ive left it sit but look if your barn here changes color great whoop-dee-doo what does it show you show you the carbon dioxide dissolves in water ms carbonic acid theres an exchange of oxygen atoms so what this told me is that the way these six atoms are going to leave your body is in the same ratio that they exist in the molecule so thats a two to one ratio so that means four will go out as carbon dioxide and two go it is water thats great now I know the answer so now you do the maths so weve got the first two answers Im gonna add to the carbons the weight of four of these oxygen atoms theyre gonna go out with carbon so check that up there and Ive got two to go so two times that there we go check that with the hydrogens because theyre gonna go out with some hydrogen and now I can figure out the ratio of carbon dioxide and water from my fat so theres the totals and now weve just got to divide it by the total total and you get 8% will go out as carbon dioxide and 16% will go out as water so heres the answer then to my big fat question 8% of fat is exhaled 16% is excreted as water somehow it can be in your urine and your feces sweat that means that 10 kilograms of fat becomes eight point four kilograms of invisible gas that you breathe out thats amazing every time youre doing some exercise and your breathing rate goes up youre losing more weight than when youre sitting down and not breathing as rapidly and one point six kilograms will come out as water now we dont know if that comes out in your poo or in your where and your sweater in your tears because you cry a lot who knows but now Ive got some frequently asked questions that I need to answer because theres lots of them well theres three main ones one can I just surround a breathe more everyone asks me straight away well you cant sit around and breathe more but its called hyperventilation youve got a coax c  h1 Oh 06 out of the fat cells theyre called adipocytes and to do it biochemistry made it amazing what really goes on its a long story but you need to get them out by first of all moving more or eating less youve got to sort of starve yourself of energy so that you start turning these big molecules of fat they get broken into three fatty acids each theyre called a triglyceride but they have to be broken apart bee they can come out of the cells the hidey-holes that they live in in your bingo wings or you have double chins or your butter your muffin tops or wherever it is its hanging around in there its not going to come out until this hormone breaks them apart into its fatty acids it goes into your bloodstream and then you can oxidize them beta oxidation big long story really complicated amazing that we know but FAQ number two is does weight loss cause climate change well this is another really disturbing little thing because it means people dont understand climate change they just dont because if you did you wouldnt even think that but people think so why doesnt it cause climate change because food was made by plants just in the last couple of years and the way it did it was it took sunlight and glued water to carbon dioxide when you eat youre actually the energy is sunlight it was put there by the Sun if I wasnt well Im not a hippie but I just about am because I think that this is amazing you eat sunlight thats the energy that you get but its modern sunlight when you burn fossil fuels thats ancient sunlight its locked up in the ground as carbon in wood Deadwood ancient fossilized coal and oil is ancient dead fossilized critters that lived in the sea that photosynthesize that died that got buried that eventually turned it all this does not cause climate change and the fact that people dont know that means we need to teach them more about climate change no wonder there are so many myths about both these things there are myths about weight loss there are so many diet gurus out there mate if they didnt know this are you gonna trust anything else they have to say to you no hopefully not stop buying their books that pills their rubbish why did you not know this until today I dont know the answer but it certainly makes me very very skeptical about any health claim that anyone makes whos supposedly a guru the third question that you dont get asked but I should get asked that I dont get asked at all except the biochemist would be sitting there wondering it right now did you take into account ketosis and no not really I did not ketosis is when you starve yourself of carbohydrates when theres no glucose in your blood and you can do this thing called ketogenesis your liver does it and can convert fat molecules into ketone bodies there acetone is one of them you go to a nail shop get your nail polish removed acetone right your body makes that stuff but you dont want to make it in huge quantities because you go into acidosis so Im not going to comment on whether or not eating low protein diets is a good idea because Im not an expert on that I would say that Id be careful because its linked to depression apparently in some papers I dont know Im not making any health claims about low protein diets what Im saying is that this is very simple if you just do what I did and what lots and lots and lots of other people I dont want to meddle its easy all you have to do to lose weight is turn it into carbon dioxide and water and to do that all you have to do is eat less move more and keep reading thank you you
34,0,"Translator: Rhonda JacobsnReviewer: Tanya Cushman What if I told you that breakfastnbeing the most important meal of the day was wrong? () What if I told you it is more importantnwhen you eat than what you eat? Perhaps much of the nutritional dogmanthat weve been raised with is now outdated, like snacking all day longnand eating many meals. Over the next few minutes,nI plan to discuss with you what I believe to be the most profoundlyntransmational concept and strategy as it pertains to health and aging. Over the last 20 years, as a nurse practitionernand a functional nutritionist, Ive seen tremendous shifts, tremendous shifts in health and wellness: escalating rates of obesity, diabetesnand cardiovascular disease - many of which are preventable.  choices we make in terms of nutritionnare profoundly impactful on our health, more than most of us realize. During my training as a nurse practitioner many years ago, the dominant nutritional paradigmnwas exercise more, eat less. Ive found thisnto be profoundly ineffective  most, if not all,nof my female patients.  concept of ""calories-in,ncalories-out"" alone is just not effective. Many of the things that I work with,nwith my female patients really focus on the connectionnbetween our lifestyle choices and how that impacts healthy aging and weight gain. I do not believe, nor do I support,nthe limiting belief that women have to accept weight gainnas a normal function of aging.  National Healthnand Nutrition Exam Survey, which looks at datanwith regard to children and adults in terms of their nutritionnand escalating obesity rates, compares what went on in the 1970s, where most Americansnconsumed three meals a day and no snacks; fast ward to today, most of what we are doing as Americansnis eating three meals a day and snacking all day long. Really. And so one of the thingsnthat starts to happen when healthcare providersnare telling our patients that we need to eat all day long - its wrong. Eating all day long overtaxesnour pancreas and our digestive system. It overtaxes it so muchnthat it cannot work properly. And if it cannot work properly,nwe cannot absorb our food or the nutrients in that food. Another really important distinctionnwhen it comes to meal frequency, or how frequently were eating, is the debate over sugar burnersnversus fat burners. And when were talking about that, a sugar burner is someonenthat consumes lots of carbohydrates and taps into glucosenas their primary fuel source, which is incredibly inefficient. If you recognize these individuals: y are frequently hungry. y often get hangry. y have - yes - significant dipsnin their energy level. y struggle more with fat loss,nand they struggle more with their weight because insulin levels are high. Insulin is that fat-storing hormone. So if levels remain high,nwe have more oxidative stress; we have more inflammation; and we struggle more with weight gain. In sharp contrast to this are fat burners. y tap into fat stores  energy; they have sustained energy; they are much more clear cognitively; they dont get hangry; its easier  them to lose weight because they tap into those fat stores; they sleep better;nand they age more slowly. So meal timing and how frequentlynwe are eating - its absolutely crucial. Absolutely crucial. Lets talk about some statisticsnas they pertain to women and healthy aging. So we know two-thirds of womenn0-0 years of age are overweight, and more than half are obese. How do we proactivelynaddress this statistic without quick fixes? It makes me want to cry when my female patientsnwould prefer I write them a prescription than work on changing their diet, more exercise, other lifestyle changes. Women in their 0s and 60sngain an average of 1. pounds per year. Per year. Thats average. And some of this is attributablento things like hormonal fluctuations, women having less lean muscle massnthan their male counterparts, sleep disturbances and mood disorders. However, there are strategiesnwe can use to help offset this. So folks, I want you to save your money on potions and powders and supplementsnthat are not long-term solutions. Ive got a better idea. And Im going to tell you about it. Ive got a better idea. re are lots of strategiesnthat I use with my female patients, but none more powerfulnthan intermittent fasting. Intermittent fastingncan help fuel fat loss as well as many other benefitsnthat Ill talk more about in a second. But it also can improveninterpersonal relationships and self-esteem. And  many women, this permits them - its the magic bullet that allows themnto gain back their mer selves. Really powerful. And the really cool thingnabout intermittent fasting is its free, its flexible and its simple. You take nothing else away. Free. Flexible. Simple. So lets talk about intermittent fasting. It is the absence of foodnduring a prescribed time period. You exist either in a fednor a fasted state. Im sure  many of you,nyou had breakfast this morning. So when you eat, insulinnis secreted by the pancreas to move sugar into the cells. We store the bulk of our sugarnin our liver and our skeletal muscle. But when we exceed those storage sites, we store it as fat. When were fasted, insulin levels are low and we can tap into fat stores  energy. Free. Flexible. Simple. And so, when were talking aboutnintermittent fasting, its fairly simple. If you skip breakfast - If you skip breakfast in the morning, you can reduce your caloric intakenby 20 to 0 percent. And the typical time framenthat I recommend to my female patients is a 16:8. Sixteen hours a day fastednwith an eight-hour feeding window. I know that seemsna little overwhelming at first, but Ill give you some strategiesn how you go about doing that. So, the 20-0 percentnreduction in calories means that you can fuel fat loss. So what are some of the benefitsnother than fat loss - fat loss and especially visceral fatnaround our abdomens, around our major organs? We know that it improves mental claritynbecause insulin levels are low. We know that it spikesnhuman growth hormone, which helps us with lean muscle mass. We know that it inducesnsomething called autophagy - I will speak more about this in a second. But this is spring cleaning  the cells. It is only evoked when we are fasted. Autophagy. We know that it lowers insulin levels, blood pressure, improves our cholesterol profile. And we know that it can reduce your riskn developing cancer and Alzheimers disease,nwhich I like to call type 3 diabetes. If,  no other reason,nwe want to protect our brains. As wonderful a strategy as this is,nit is not  everyone. Im going to talk briefly about the individualsnthat want to avoid this strategy. First and emost,nif you are a brittle diabetic, or you have difficult-to-control diabetes; if you are a child, an adolescentnor age greater than 70 - might not be the best strategy; if you are pregnant; if you have chronic heart issues,nkidney or renal issues - not the best strategy. If you have a historynof a disordered relationship with food, whether it is anorexia,nbulimia or binge eating - might not be the best strategynbecause it can invoke those tendencies. And last but not least,nif you have a low body mass index, youre frail or youve recently been in the hospitalnlike I was  13 days. Im not currently intermittent fasting. Now, everyone always asks, Well, when youre fasting,nwe know were not eating food, but you can absolutely consume thingsnlike filtered water, plain coffee or tea. y will not break your fast. But when youre ready to eat,nwhat do you eat? Now, I would be remissnif I did not mention that there are foods that are going to be morenadvantageous  you to consume when youre ready to break your fast. So I want you to focusnon real whole foods. Thats what your body needs,nwants and deserves. So I want you to purchase the best qualitynprotein that your budget permits. Ideally, organic or pastured meat,nwild-caught fish. Healthy fats - so crucial - helpful  building healthy hormones and also really important  satiety -nmaking sure our taste buds light up, make us happy. Im not part of the anti-fat brigade. Really, really important. Twenty years ago, I mightnhave told you not to eat fat, but now we know better. So I want you to focusnon things like avocados, coconut oil, grass-fed butter and nuts -nreally great, healthy fats. Unprocessed carbohydrates. Ladies, absolutely crucial, if youre in perimenopause,nthe five to seven years bee menopause, or youre in menopause, quality and quantity are crucial. So I want you to consume thingsnlike low-glycemic berries, green leafy vegetables, squash,nquinoa, sweet potatoes as opposed to bread and pasta. Cautionary tale: I want younto limit sugar and alcohol. By that I mean, I want younto not consume those things because they can offsetnall the good that youre doing. And lastly, keep yourself well hydrated. Now, I want to make sure that I briefly touch onnsome of the practical implications  how you would go aboutnstarting intermittent fasting. Generally, I have my ladiesnstart with 12-13 hours of fasted period. And they can slowly increasenby an hour or so every day until theyve reached that 16 hour mark. Again, you want to keep yourselfnreally well hydrated. You can also have plain coffee or tea. In addition to that, you want to ensurenthat you give it a solid 30 days bee you determinenif its the right strategy  you. And if you have chronic health conditions, I want to make sure you discuss itnwith your healthcare provider. Really important. And recognize it may takensix to eight weeks to really see the full benefitsnof what youre doing.  biggest pain pointn my female patients is weight gain. I have a fantastic strategynto help with this, but I dont want you to buy intonthe next $0 container of protein powder or the hottest weight lossnsupplement thats out there. I want you to think about the factnthis is a simple, flexible and free option that you can try at home, discuss with your healthcarenprovider if necessary. I really feel so passionately about this because its something that all of usnshould be discussing with our patients. Thank you. ()"
35,0,"Transcriber: Robert TuckernReviewer: Denise RQ Did you know that the average ncaveman in the Stone Age spent five times as much energynon physical activity as the average American adult today? And I mean our average cavemannin the Stone Age had to walk  up to 16 kilometers a day, had to chase his prey  days on end, so then when he finally made his kill, he could rightfully stuffnhis face with meat and eat as much as he wanted. However, nowadays,novereating is a global problem and the cause of manynsevere health threats. % of the diabetes burden,n23% of the ischemic heart disease burden, and up to 1% of certain ncancer burdens are linked to obesity. So, these numbers are the thingsnyou learn from text books, the facts everyone ncan look up on the Internet, but once I started workingnin the hospital as a junior intern, and met people nwho were struggling with obesity, I realized that its often notnthese physical consequences that seem to matter most to those nwho are overweight themselves. Lets take a look at the picturenof this girl as an example.  quote that came to my mindnwhen I saw this picture was: ""To lose confidence in ones body,nis to lose confidence in oneself."" Because the girl you seenis only 1 years old, but already weighs over 100 kilograms, and tonight shes goingnto her high schools prom, and you can see shes all dressed up,nposing  a picture, probably taken by one of her parents. And yet, in spite of the brave smilenshes putting up, you can also instantlynsense her insecurity. You can see shes not reallynlooking ward to the night. Only 1 years oldnwith a whole life ahead of her, and already she hasnlost confidence in herself. This is only one example of peoplenwho are severely unhappy in their body, but still cant manage to lose weight. And it made me wonder why because there are stacks of booksnon how to lose weight, web pages full of tips and tricks, and plenty of experts to guidenyou through the process. So, if its not  a lack of toolsnthen why is it so many of us cant manage to lose weightnor keep the weight off? And I ask myself all these questions, and then, as we are taughtnwithin the problem-based learning system here at Maastricht University, I realized that the best way to findnthe answer was to go look  it myself. And so I stumbled upon some researchnon the science of complexity by two professorsnat York University in Canada. And I found their theorynsurprisingly applicable to the process of losing weight. You see, they proposed there arenthree types of problems in the world: the simple, the complicated,nand the complex. So, simple problems are nthe ones like following a recipe. You need some basic techniquesnand perhaps a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it, following the recipe hasna very high chance of success. Complicated problems cover problems nlike sending a rocket to the Moon, which does sound pretty complicated to me. However, complicated problemsncan often be broken down into a string of simple problems. So when coordinated well, these complicated problemsnstill carry a high rate of success. Finally, complex problemsnare the ones like raising a child. re is no recipe  success. And while raising one childnmay certainly provide experience, it doesnt guarantee successnwith the next child because every child is unique and may requirenan entirely different approach. So, our cavemen in the Stone Age didnt have any notice of complexity,nhis life was simple, and basic, and as simple pretty much as it could be. But, nowadays, in our modern time, the process of losing weight definitelynseems to be a complex problem, there is no recipe  success. And certainly there may bensome basic ingredients, eating differently,nchanging your exercise pattern, but there are no standard tools to use, and no definitive ordernof steps to follow.  remarkable thing is that many thingsnin our environment suggest that losing weight is, in fact,nsimply a matter of following a recipe. Drink these shakes, eat nthese protein bars, skip all carbs, drink gallons of water, avoid all sugars,nand you will lose weight, and you will be happy ever, and you will never feel insecurenin your life anymore, ever, right? No. Id like to take you back to the picturenof the girl we saw at the beginning because the next picture isnthe same girl one year later. And seven years later,nshes standing here right in front of you sharing a story that appears to be nownabout as personal as it gets. And five months ago I told my story  the very first timenat the xMaastricht pitch night. I showed the audiencenthe same two pictures leaving the second onento right bee the end. When I told them that it wasnthe same girl as in the first picture, an audible sigh of genuine surprisenwent through the public because they realized, as you do nby now, that that girl was me. And what struck me mostnafter the pitch night were not the kind words from my friends, and not the complimentsnfrom strangers in the audience. No, it was that audible sighnof genuine surprise that I had heardnwhen showing the second picture that quite confused me. You see, I had never expectednthat anyone seeing that first picture wouldnt immediately recognizenthe girl to be me because whenevernI picture myself in my head, I still look that way. Seven years after physicallynlosing 0 kilos, I still struggle to recognize nthe way my body looks now. And it confused menbecause Id always thought that losing weight was as simple as,nwell, losing the weight. So, only a moment ago, I told you aboutnhow losing weight is a complex problem, that there are no standard tools to use and no definitive ordernof steps to follow. But most importantly,nthat its a personal problem requiring a personal solution, its a matter of compiling your ownnpersonal recipe to losing weight. So, have I found all the ingredientsnto my recipe of losing weight and keeping the weight off nand being happy with my new body? I think that in past few yearsnI have found out about quite a few things that work  me, but its the final seasoning of the dishnthats still a bit of a struggle. You see, its scary as hell to admitnthat sometimes Im still feeling fat, and that when I look in the mirrornI struggle to recognize the same image other people nsee when looking at me, and that sharing my story with you today, means overcoming one of my biggest fears. Because what Im scared of most is not that I stumble on wordsnor get my lines; what Im scared of mostnis that when I leave this stage, you will look at your neighbor,nraise an eyebrow, and say: ""I dont get why shes on stage;nshes still fat."" But I also know that that fear isnirrational, as are many fears, and I no longer want to be scarednbecause a great man once said that: ""Courage is not the absence of fearnbut the triumph over it,"" and that: ""the brave man is not henwho is not afraid, but he who conquers that fear."" And maybe, the triumphnover one of my biggest fears is that final seasoning my dish needs, my final step to completingnmy recipe to losing weight. So, as long as Im still scared,nI will continue to conquer my fear, and I will continue to tell my story until I no longer neednto summon up any courage to tell people that I used nto be fat, but no longer am. And I hope some of you maynfind comt in this story, knowing that losing weight nand being happy with your new body is not always as easy asnour society makes you think. And I hope you will findnyour own ingredients and compile your own recipe. And do remember, that, in the end,nits only one person that has to be satisfiednwith the taste of the final dish. And that person is you. Thank you. ()"
36,0,good evening everybody welcome to the   Correspondents Dinner the night when Washington celebrates itself somebodys got to do it and welcome to the fourth quarter of my presidency its true why that was Michelle cheering fact is I feel more loose and relaxed than ever those Joe Bidens shoulder massages theyre like magic theres a trauma or you have I am to make the most of every moment I have left after the midterm elections my advisers asked me mr. president do you have a bucket list and I said well I have something that rhymes with bucket list take executive action on immigration bucket this Harmon regulations bucket right thing to do my new attitude is paying off look at my Cuba policy the Castro brothers are here tonight welcome to America I move us que pasa what its  Castros from Texas Oh Iowa cream hi who Leone anyway being president is never easy I still have to fix a broken immigration system issue veto threats negotiate with Iran all while finding time to pray five times a day and it is no wonder that people keep pointing out how the presidency has aged me I look so old John Boehner czar to invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral meanwhile Miss has an age today I asked her what her secret is she just says fresh fruits and vegetables its aggravating fact is though at this point my legacy is finally beginning to take shape the economy is getting better 9 in 10 Americans now have health coverage today thanks to care you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job youre welcome Senate  not look it is true I have not managed to make everybody happy six years into my presidency some people still say Im arrogant and aloof condescending some people are so dumb no wonder I dont meet with them and thats not all people say about me a few weeks ago Dick Cheney says he thinks Im the worst president of his lifetime which is interesting because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime what a coincidence everybodys got something to say these days Mike Huckabee recently said people shouldnt join our military until a true conservative is elected president think about that rageous 7 ayatollahs wrote us a letter trying to explain to huckabee how our system works it gets worse just this week Michelle Bachman ash actually predicted that I would bring about the biblical end of days now thats a legacy as big I mean Lincoln Washington they didnt do that but you know I just had to put this stuff aside Ive got to stay focused on my job because  many Americans this is still a time of deep uncertainty  example I have a I have one friend just a few weeks ago she was making millions of dollars a year and shes now living out of a van in Iowa meanwhile back in our nations capital were always dealing with new challenges Im happy to report that the Secret Service thanks to some excellent reporting by white house correspondents theyre really focusing on some of the issues that have come up and they finally figured out a foolproof way to keep people off my lawn as works as not just fence jumpers a few months ago a drone crash landed out back that was pretty serious but dont worry weve installed a new state-of-the-art security system you know what let me set the record straight you know I tease Joe sometimes but he has been at my side  seven years I love that man hes not just a great vice president he is a great friend I weve gotten so close in some places in Indiana they wont serve us pizza anymore I want to thank our hosts  the evening Chicago girl be incredibly talented Cicely strong on Saturday Night Live Cicely impersonates CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin which is surprising because usually the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are journalists on CNN ABC is here with some of the stars from their big new comedy blackish its a great show but I have to give ABC fair warning being blackish only makes you popular  so long trust me theres a shelf-life to that thing as always the reporters here had a lot to cover over the last year here on the East Coast one big story was the brutal winter the polar vortex blows they renamed it  but of course lets face it there is one issue on every reporters minds and that is 2016 already weve seen some missteps it turns out Jeb Bush identified himself as Hispanic back in 2009 what you know what I look I understand its an innocent mistake reminds me of when I identified myself as American back in 1961 Ted Cruz said that denying the existence of climate change may made him like Galileo now thats not really an apt comparison Galileo believed the Earth revolves around the Sun Ted Cruz believes the Earth revolves around Ted Cruz and this is an aside I want to point out when a guy who has his face on a hope poster calls you self-centered you know youve got a problem the narcissism index is creeping up a little too high meanwhile Rick Santorum announced that he would not attend the same-sex wedding of a friend or a loved one to which gays and lesbians across the country responded thats not going to be a problem dont sweat that one and Donald Trump is here still anyway its amazing how time flies soon the first presidential contest will take place and I  one cannot wait to see who the Koch brothers pick its exciting Marco Rubio Rand Paul Ted Cruz Jeb Bush Scott Walker who will finally get that red rose the winner gets a billion dollar war chest the runner-up gets to be the bachelor on the next season of  Bachelor mysteriously a billion dollars from just two guys is it just me or does that feel a little excessive its almost insulting to the candidates though the Koch brothers think they need to spend a billion dollars to get folks to like one of these people its got to hurt their feelings a little bit and look I know Ive raised a lot of money too but in all fairness my middle name is Hussein whats the excuse the trail hasnt been easy  my fellow  either as we all know Hillarys private emails got her in trouble frankly I thought it was going to be a private Instagram account that was going to cause her bigger problems hilary kicks things off by going completely unrecognized and its your polling not to be outdone martin omalley kick things off completely unrecognized that a martin omalley campaign event and Bernie Sanders might run I like burning Bernies an interesting guy apparently some folks really want to see a pot-smoking socialist in the   we could get a third  term after all could happen anyway as always I want to close on a more serious note and I often joke about tensions between me and the press but honestly what they say doesnt bother me I understand weve got an adversarial system Im a mellow sort of guy and thats why I invited Luther my anger translator to join me here tonight hold on to your lily-white butts in our fast-changing world traditions like the   Correspondents Dinner are important because despite our differences we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day then we could count on Fox  to terrify all white people responses ridiculous we wont always see eye to eye in CNN thank you so much  the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage but two whole weeks we were one step away from the walking dead that was awesome oh and by the way just if youve noticed you dont have Ebola but I still deeply appreciate the work that you do dont know what I had that big old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and then I plugged it remember that which s Katrina was that one was at 19 over was a 22 doctor I can remember protecting our democracy is more important than ever  example the Supreme Court ruled that the donor who gave Ted Cruz six million dollars was just exercising free speech yeah its the kind of speech like this I just wasted six million dollars and its not just Republicans Hillary will have to rage use sums of money - Oh so go get that money shell get off all the money Khaleesi is coming to Westeros Oh an unsent focus on billionaire donors creates real problems  our democracy thats why weve got it no were not were not who the hell said that but we do need to stay focused on some big challenges like climate change this is odd you havent noticed Calinia is bone dry it looked like a trailer  the new Mad Max movie up in there yall think that Bradley Cooper came here because he wants to talk to Chuck Todd he needed a glass of water the science is clear the science is clear nine out of the ten hottest years ever came in the last decade not a lot of scientists but I do know how to conjugate rising seas more violent storms got mosquitos sweaty people on the train stinking it up is just nasty look at is what look at whats happening right now every serious scientist says we need to act the Pentagon says its a national security risk Miami floods on a sunny day and instead of doing anything about it weve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate its okay I think I got it Brian it is crazy what about our kids what kind of stupid short-sighted irresponsible Hey whoa all due respect sir you dont need an anger translator you need counsel and Im out of here man I try to get into all this go Luther my anger translator is young now that I got that off my chest you know investigative journalism explanatory Pleasant journalism that exposes corruption and injustice and gives voice to the different and the marginalized the voiceless thats power its a privilege its as important to Americas trajectory to our values our ideals than anything that we could do in elected office we remember journalists we lost over the past year journalists like steven sotloff and james foley murdered  nothing more than trying to shine a light into some of the worlds darkest corners we remember the journalists unjustly imprisoned around the world including our own jason raize an  nine months jason has been imprisoned in Tehran  nothing more than writing about the hopes and the fears of the Iranian people carrying their stories to the readers of  Washington Post an eft to bridge our common humanity as was already mentioned Jasons brother Ali is here tonight and I have told him personally we will not rest until we bring him home to his family safe and sound these journalists and so many others view their work is more than just a profession but as a public good an indispensable pillar of our society so I want to give a toast to them I raise a glass to them and all of you with the words of the American eign correspondent Dorothy Thompson it is not the fact of Liberty Liberty is exercised that ultimately determines whether Liberty itself survives thank you  your devotion to exercising our Liberty and in telling our American story god bless you god bless the United States of America
37,1,"China is bouncing back from the effects of coronavirus and the world is watching to see what they can expect from life after lockdown Chinas economy is now functioning its around 90 percent of normal levels 90 percent is an incredible achievement but in practice will feel very very strange a 90 percent economy may not sound too bad but  many it could be catastrophic some of the worst unemployment numbers in this countrys history 6.6 million plus people laid off in a single week it wouldnt be that surprising if we think we kind of through the worst of it we end a lockdown and then actually been finished thats it even worse as global lock downs ease the economy faces the greatest challenge in living memory heres what you need to know [] in China factories are up and running classrooms are full restaurants are open but the economy has not returned to normal in fact its operating at around 90% of usual levels and as lockdowns es elsewhere this 90% economy could be what the rest of the world has to look ward to regardless of how countries have dealt with the pandemic its becoming clear that once businesses have to operate with social distancing in place the economy can be expected to shrink by about 10 percent whether thats in South Korea America or Sweden but the missing 10% will mean life will feel far from normal in China large chunks of everyday life are missing having collapsed in January consumer footfall has recovered to about half its previous levels hotel occupancy is still down by around 0% and 7% fewer people are flying whats mainly in the missing 10% is stuff that its hard to do if youre trying to social visit so things like restaurants at hotels theaters cinemas and crucially its also the way in which people tend to have fun theres a world where you work and then as soon as the day is over you immediately get back to your house as fast as possible this dip in so-called fun spending will continue even after lockdowns are relaxed in Sweden most people were never asked to stay at home during the pandemic but Swedish spending patterns over the past few months have mirrored those in neighboring Denmark which has been under lockdown daily restaurant turnover fell by 70 percent last month as uncertainty over the economy and fear of infection meant fewer Swedes ate out and while overall Danish spending fell by 29 percent during lockdown Swedes cut their spending by almost as much what the evidence suggests now is that actually its peoples own voluntary decisions about how they behave with shaping economies actually more than what the government is telling people to do the lockdown itself is not really influencing behavior that much the true economic impact of imposing lockdowns will take time to emerge in China it was several months after the lockdown began to be lifted bee bankruptcy numbers started to rise it wouldnt be that surprising if we think we kind of through the worst of it we end the lockdown and then actually bail in film starts to get even worse than we had expected  the past few months the global economy has been propped up by unprecedented levels of state aid in Europes five largest economies one in five workers is currently in a special scheme where the state pays their wages the governor has deployed 70 billion euros to sustain companies thats unprecedented the government is going to step in and help to pay peoples wages its only as this support is gradually withdrawn that the wider cost of covert 19 will become clear it will feel quite sort of uncertain because you know no one really knows how businesses and households are going to be able to survive weeks and months of of much lower incomes it will impact all levels of the economy lets take a look at one scenario a small business owner runs a chain of restaurants when the pandemic hits he takes out a loan and furloughs his staff hes not alone in March more cash was handed out to UK businesses than in any month since records began after lockdown he reopened but business is slow so he makes staff redundant and closes a restaurant as he cant pay the rent this has already been happening in the first quarter of the year the share of commercial tenants who paid their rent on time in Britain fell from ninety percent to 60 percent with big firms like Burger King admitting they couldnt make rent on empty restaurants without these rent payments his landlord can no longer keep up with her mortgage and ultimately her bank is left with debt that cannot be repaid the problem with all of these losses across the economy is that someone eventually has to sort of admit that they are going to bear these losses and the color consequences of that  business confidence and  investment could be could be very significant if you are concerned that your customers or your tenants or whoever is not going to actually be paying the money they owe you then making new investments is not just risky its actually completely impossible to price because everything is so unstable and so the risk of that is that things like investment get cut back massively and that will you know that will have very large effects key economic factors already indicate that the world is facing a prolonged recession already unemployment in America is at its highest rate since the Great Depression but these losses will not be felt equally to see how lets go back to our restaurant owner the industrys hit hardest by the clover 19 pandemic our labor intensive and rely on an army of low paid workers and it is these people who are particularly likely to lose their jobs in America you are already twice as likely to be made redundant if youre earning less than $20,000 a year then $80,000 a year the kind of jobs that wont exist at all or in much reduced numbers will be the kind of jobs that are typically done by people who are paid less john started on by women and jobs that are done by I think minorities more commonly so thats jobs and things like pleasure hospitality retail trade and that kind of thing so I think you could expect an employment to be really concentrated in certain groups and these economic changes will shape the political agenda in the post lockdown world you can imagine a situation where it becomes kind of common sensical that the essential workers whove kept the economy going you can imagine a push towards trying to improve their standard of living and standard of work on the other hand you could imagine a situation where countries kind of closed it on themselves and say you know we dont want to move boats because immigrants bringing disease and we want to make sure that we have capacity to build vaccines  our citizens  no one else its too soon to know which way the political tide will turn and each countrys response will be different but one certainty is that the longer we all have to wait  a vaccine to be developed and distributed or effective treatment found the more pronounced the effects of the 90% economy will be my name is Callan Williams Im senior economics writer at the  if you want to read more about the economic consequences of the corona virus pandemic then click the

38,0,"Speaker:nMr. President,nladies and gentlemen, history is more than thenpath left by the past. It influences the presentnand can shape the future. We meet today innWestminster Hall, a building begun 900 years agonwhen the Vikings were visiting the shores of what wouldnbecome the United States, even if it was Columbus whonwould subsequently demonstrate the politicians artnof arriving late, but claiming all the credit. () This hall has witnessed grimntrials in the sentencing to death of a king, coronationnbanquets, ceremonial addresses, and the coffins of thosenreceiving the last respects of our people. Few places reach so far intonthe heart of our nation. Yet until today, no Americannpresident has stood on these steps to address ourncountrys Parliament. It is my honor, Mr. President,nto welcome you as our friend and as a statesman. Statesmanship is the cementnwhich seals our shared idealism as nations. It makes meaningful the unity ofnambition, passion  freedom, and abhorrence of injusticenthat is the call of our close alliance. It has fallen to you to tackleneconomic turbulence at home, to protect the healthnof those without wealth, and to seek that preciousnbalance between security which is too often threatened, andnhuman rights which are too often denied. History is not the burden ofnany one man or woman alone. But some are called tonmeet a special share of its challenges. It is a duty that you dischargenwith a dignity, determination, and distinction thatnare widely admired. Abraham Lincoln once observednthat nearly all men can stand adversity. But if you want to test a mansncharacter, give him power. Ladies and gentlemen, thenPresident of the United States of America, Barack . () President :nThank you very much. () Thank you very much. Thank you. () Thank you. () Thank you so much. () My Lord Chancellor, Mr. Speaker,nMr. Prime Minister, my lords, and members of then of Commons: I have known few greater honorsnthan the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliamentsnat Westminster Hall. I am told that the last threenspeakers here have been the Pope, Her Majesty thenQueen, and Nelson Mandela -- which is either a very highnbar or the beginning of a very funny joke. () I come here today tonreaffirm one of the oldest, one of the strongest alliancesnthe world has ever known. Its long been said that thenUnited States and the United Kingdom share anspecial relationship. And since we also share annespecially active press corps, that relationship is oftennanalyzed and overanalyzed  the slightest hintnof stress or strain. Of course, all relationshipsnhave their ups and downs. Admittedly, ours got off on thenwrong foot with a small scrape about tea and taxes. () re may also have beennsome hurt feelings when the   was set on firenduring the War of 1812. () But tunately, its beennsmooth sailing ever since.  reason  this closenfriendship doesnt just have to do with our shared history,nour shared heritage; our ties of languagenand culture; or even the strong partnershipnbetween our governments. Our relationship is specialnbecause of the values and beliefs that have unitednour people through the ages. Centuries ago, whennkings, emperors, and warlords reignednover much of the world, it was the English who firstnspelled out the rights and liberties of mannin the Magna Carta. It was here, in this very hall,nwhere the rule of law first developed, courtsnwere established, disputes were settled, andncitizens came to petition their leaders. Over time, the people ofnthis nation waged a long and sometimes bloody strugglento expand and secure their freedom from the crown. Propelled by the idealsnof the Enlightenment, they would ultimately genan English Bill of Rights, and invest the power to governnin an elected parliament thats gathered here today. What began on this island wouldninspire millions throughout the continent of Europenand across the world. But perhaps no one drew greaterninspiration from these notions of freedom than yournrabble-rousing colonists on the other sidenof the Atlantic. As Winston Churchillnsaid, the ""...Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, HabeasnCorpus, trial by jury, and English common law findntheir most famous expression in the American Declarationnof Independence."" For both of our nations, livingnup to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents hasnsometimes been difficult, has always been anwork in progress.  path has never been perfect. But through the strugglesnof slaves and immigrants, women and ethnic minorities,nmer colonies and persecuted religions, we have learnednbetter than most that the longing  freedom and humanndignity is not English or American or Westernn-- it is universal, and it beats in every heart. Perhaps thats why there arenfew nations that stand firmer, speak louder, and fight hardernto defend democratic values around the world than the UnitednStates and the United Kingdom. We are the allies whonlanded at Omaha and Gold, who sacrificed side by side tonfree a continent from the march of tyranny, and help prosperitynflourish from the ruins of war. And with the founding ofnNATO -- a British idea -- we joined a transatlanticnalliance that has ensured our security  overnhalf a century. Together with our allies,nwe ged a lasting peace from a cold war. When the Iron Curtain lifted, wenexpanded our alliance to include the nations of Centralnand Eastern Europe, and built new bridges to Russianand the mer states of the Soviet Union. And when there wasnstrife in the Balkans, we worked togethernto keep the peace. Today, after a difficult decadenthat began with war and ended in recession, our nations havenarrived at a pivotal moment once more. A global economy that once stoodnon the brink of depression is now stable and recovering. After years of conflict, thenUnited States has removed 100,000 troops from Iraq, thenUnited Kingdom has removed its ces, and our combatnmission there has ended. In Afghanistan, weve broken thenTalibans momentum and will soon begin a transitionnto Afghan lead. And nearly 10 years after 9/11,nwe have disrupted terrorist networks and dealt al Qaeda anhuge blow by killing its leader -- Osama bin Laden. Together, we havenmet great challenges. But as we enter this newnchapter in our shared history, profound challengesnstretch out bee us. In a world where the prosperitynof all nations is now inextricably linked, a new eranof cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stabilitynof the global economy. As new threats spreadnacross borders and oceans, we must dismantle terroristnnetworks and stop the spread of nuclear weapons, confrontnclimate change and combat famine and disease. And as a revolution racesnthrough the streets of the Middle East and North Africa,nthe entire world has a stake in the aspirations of angeneration that longs to determine its own destiny. se challenges come at a timenwhen the international order has already been reshapedn a new century. Countries like China, India,nand Brazil are growing by leaps and bounds. We should welcomenthis development,  it has lifted hundreds ofnmillions from poverty around the globe, and created newnmarkets and opportunities  our own nations. And yet, as this rapidnchange has taken place, its become fashionable in somenquarters to question whether the rise of these nations willnaccompany the decline of American and Europeanninfluence around the world. Perhaps, the argument goes,nthese nations represent the future, and the time nour leadership has passed. That argument is wrong.  time  ournleadership is now. It was the United States andnthe United Kingdom and our democratic allies that shaped anworld in which new nations could emerge and individualsncould thrive. And even as more nations take onnthe responsibilities of global leadership, our alliance willnremain indispensable to the goal of a century thatnis more peaceful, more prosperous and more just. At a time when threats andnchallenges require nations to work in concertnwith one another, we remain the greatestncatalysts  global action. In an era defined by thenrapid flow of commerce and inmation, it is our freenmarket tradition, our openness, tified by our commitment tonbasic security  our citizens, that offers the best chancenof prosperity that is both strong and shared. As millions are still deniedntheir basic human rights because of who they are, ornwhat they believe, or the kind of governmentnthat they live under, we are the nations most willingnto stand up  the values of tolerance and self-determinationnthat lead to peace and dignity. Now, this doesnt mean wencan afd to stand still.  nature of our leadership willnneed to change with the times. As I said the first time Incame to London as President,  the G20 summit, the daysnare gone when Roosevelt and Churchill could sit in a roomnand solve the worlds problems over a glass of brandy --nalthough Im sure that Prime Minister Cameron would agreenthat some days we could both use a stiff drink. () In this century, our jointnleadership will require building new partnerships,nadapting to new circumstances, and remaking ourselves to meetnthe demands of a new era. That begins with ourneconomic leadership. Adam Smiths central insightnremains true today: re is no greater generator of wealth andninnovation than a system of free enterprise that unleashes thenfull potential of individual men and women. Thats what led to thenIndustrial Revolution that began in the factories of Manchester. That is what led to the dawn ofnthe Inmation Age that arose from the office parksnof Silicon Valley. Thats why countries like China,nIndia and Brazil are growing so rapidly -- becausenin fits and starts, they are moving towardnmarket-based principles that the United States and the UnitednKingdom have always embraced. In other words, we live in anglobal economy that is largely of our own making. And today, the competition nthe best jobs and industries favors countries thatnare free-thinking and ward-looking; countries withnthe most creative and innovative and entrepreneurial citizens. That gives nations like thenUnited States and the United Kingdom an inherent advantage. For from Newton and Darwinnto Edison and Einstein, from Alan Turing to Steve Jobs,nwe have led the world in our commitment to science andncutting-edge research, the discovery of newnmedicines and technologies. We educate our citizens andntrain our workers in the best colleges andnuniversities on Earth. But to maintain this advantagenin a world thats more competitive than ever, we willnhave to redouble our investments in science and engineering, andnrenew our national commitments to educating our workces. Weve also been reminded in thenlast few years that markets can sometimes fail. In the last century, both ournnations put in place regulatory frameworks to deal with suchnmarket failures -- safeguards to protect the banking systemnafter the Great Depression,  example; regulations thatnwere established to prevent the pollution of our air andnour water during the 1970s. But in todays economy, suchnthreats of market failure can no longer be contained withinnthe borders of any one country. Market failures can gonglobal, and go viral, and demand international responses. A financial crisis that begannon   infected nearly every continent, which is why wenmust keep working through ums like the G20 to put in placenglobal rules of the road to prevent futurenexcesses and abuse. No country can hide from thendangers of carbon pollution, which is why we must build onnwhat was achieved at Copenhagen and Cancun to leave ournchildren a planet that is safer and cleaner. Moreover, even when the freenmarket works as it should, both our countries recognizenthat no matter how responsibly we live in our lives,nhard times or bad luck, a crippling illness or a layoffnmay strike any one of us. And so part of our commonntradition has expressed itself in a conviction that everyncitizen deserves a basic measure of security -- healthncare if you get sick, unemployment insurancenif you lose your job, a dignified retirement afterna lifetime of hard work. That commitment to our citizensnhas also been the reason  our leadership in the world. And now, having come throughna terrible recession, our challenge is to meet thesenobligations while ensuring that were not consuming -- and hencenconsumed -- with a level of debt that could sap the strengthnand vitality of our economies. And that will require difficultnchoices and it will require different paths nboth of our countries. But we have faced suchnchallenges bee, and have always been able tonbalance the need  fiscal responsibility with thenresponsibilities we have to one another. And I believe wencan do this again. As we do, the successes andnfailures of our own past can serve as an example  emergingneconomies -- that its possible to grow without polluting; thatnlasting prosperity comes not from what a nation consumes,nbut from what it produces, and from the investmentsnit makes in its people and its infrastructure. And just as we must lead onnbehalf of the prosperity of our citizens, so we mustnsafeguard their security. Our two nations know what it isnto confront evil in the world. Hitlers armies would not havenstopped their killing had we not fought them on the beachesnand on the landing grounds, in the fields andnon the streets. We must never get that therenwas nothing inevitable about our victory in that terrible war. It was won through the couragenand character of our people. Precisely because we arenwilling to bear its burden, we know well the cost of war. And that is why we built annalliance that was strong enough to defend this continentnwhile deterring our enemies. At its core, NATO is rooted innthe simple concept of Article Five: that no NATO nationnwill have to fend on its own; that allies will standnby one another, always. And  six decades, NATOnhas been the most successful alliance in human history. Today, we confrontna different enemy. Terrorists have taken the livesnof our citizens in New York and in London. And while al Qaeda seeks anreligious war with the West, we must remember that they havenkilled thousands of Muslims -- men, women and childrenn-- around the globe. Our nations are not and willnnever be at war with Islam. Our fight is focused onndefeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies. In that eft, wenwill not relent, as Osama bin Laden and hisnfollowers have learned. And as we fight an enemynthat respects no law of war, we will continue to holdnourselves to a higher standard -- by living up to the values,nthe rule of law and due process that we so ardently defend. For almost a decade, Afghanistannhas been a central front of these efts. Throughout those years,nyou, the British people, have been a stalwart ally, alongnwith so many others who fight by our side. Together, let us pay tribute tonall of our men and women who have served and sacrificed overnthe last several years --  they are part of an unbrokennline of heroes who have borne the heaviest burden  thenfreedoms that we enjoy. Because of them, we havenbroken the Talibans momentum. Because of them, we havenbuilt the capacity of Afghan security ces. And because of them, we are nownpreparing to turn a corner in Afghanistan by transitioningnto Afghan lead. And during this transition, wenwill pursue a lasting peace with those who break free of alnQaeda and respect the Afghan constitution and lay down arms. And we will ensure thatnAfghanistan is never a safe haven  terror, but is insteadna country that is strong, sovereign, and able tonstand on its own two feet. Indeed, our efts in thisnyoung century have led us to a new concept  NATO that willngive us the capabilities needed to meet new threats -- threatsnlike terrorism and piracy, cyber attacks andnballistic missiles. But a revitalized NATO willncontinue to hew to that original vision of its founders, allowingnus to rally collective action  the defense of our people,nwhile building upon the broader belief of Roosevelt andnChurchill that all nations have both rights andnresponsibilities, and all nations share a commonninterest in an international architecture thatnmaintains the peace. We also share a common interestnin stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. Across the globe, nations arenlocking down nuclear materials so they never fall intonthe wrong hands -- because of our leadership. From North Korea to Iran, wevensent a message that those who flaunt their obligations willnface consequences -- which is why America and the EuropeannUnion just recently strengthened our sanctions on Iran, in largenpart because of the leadership of the United Kingdomnand the United States. And while we holdnothers to account, we will meet our own obligationsnunder the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and strive  a worldnwithout nuclear weapons. We share a common interest innresolving conflicts that prolong human suffering and threatennto tear whole regions asunder. In Sudan, after years ofnwar and thousands of deaths, we call on both North and Southnto pull back from the brink of violence and choosenthe path of peace. And in the Middle East, we standnunited in our support  a secure Israel and ansovereign Palestine. And we share a common interestnin development that advances dignity and security. To succeed, we must castnaside the impulse to look at impoverished parts of thenglobe as a place  charity. Instead, we should empower thensame ces that have allowed our own people to thrive: Wenshould help the hungry to feed themselves, the doctorsnwho care  the sick. We should support countriesnthat confront corruption, and allow theirnpeople to innovate. And we should advance the truthnthat nations prosper when they allow women and girls tonreach their full potential. We do these things because wenbelieve not simply in the rights of nations; we believe innthe rights of citizens. That is the beacon that guidednus through our fight against fascism and our twilightnstruggle against communism. And today, that idea is beingnput to the test in the Middle East and North Africa. In country after country,npeople are mobilizing to free themselves from thengrip of an iron fist. And while these movements nchange are just six months old, we have seen them play outnbee -- from Eastern Europe to the Americas, from SouthnAfrica to Southeast Asia. History tells us thatndemocracy is not easy. It will be years bee thesenrevolutions reach their conclusion, and there will bendifficult days along the way. Power rarely gives up without anfight -- particularly in places where there are divisions ofntribe and divisions of sect. We also know that populism canntake dangerous turns -- from the extremism of those who wouldnuse democracy to deny minority rights, to the nationalism thatnleft so many scars on this continent in the 20th century. But make no mistake:nWhat we saw, what we are seeing in Tehran,nin Tunis, in Tahrir Square, is a longing  the samenfreedoms that we take  granted here at home. It was a rejection of the notionnthat people in certain parts of the world dont want to benfree, or need to have democracy imposed upon them. It was a rebuke to thenworldview of al Qaeda, which smothers thenrights of individuals, and would thereby subjectnthem to perpetual poverty and violence. Let there be no doubt: nUnited States and United Kingdom stand squarely on the side ofnthose who long to be free. And now, we must show thatnwe will back up those words with deeds. That means investing in thenfuture of those nations that transition to democracy,nstarting with Tunisia and Egypt -- by deepening tiesnof trade and commerce; by helping them demonstratenthat freedom brings prosperity. And that means standingnup  universal rights -- by sanctioning thosenwho pursue repression, strengthening civilnsociety, supporting the rights of minorities. We do this knowing that the Westnmust overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in thenMiddle East and North Africa -- a mistrust that isnrooted in a difficult past. For years, weve faced chargesnof hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedomsnthat they hear us espouse. And so to them, we mustnsquarely acknowledge that, yes, we have enduring interests innthe region -- to fight terror, sometimes with partnersnwho may not be perfect; to protect against disruptionsnof the worlds energy supply. But we must also insist thatnwe reject as false the choice between our interestsnand our ideals; between stability and democracy. For our idealism is rooted innthe realities of history -- that repression offers only thenfalse promise of stability, that societies are morensuccessful when their citizens are free, and that democraciesnare the closest allies we have. It is that truth thatnguides our action in Libya. It would have been easy at thenoutset of the crackdown in Libya to say that none of this wasnour business -- that a nations sovereignty is more importantnthan the s of civilians within its borders. That argument carriesnweight with some. But we are different. We embrace a broader responsibility. And while we cannotnstop every injustice, there are circumstances that cutnthrough our caution -- when a leader is threateningnto massacre his people, and the international communitynis calling  action. Thats why we stoppedna massacre in Libya. And we will not relent until thenpeople of Libya are protected and the shadow ofntyranny is lifted. We will proceed with humility,nand the knowledge that we cannot dictate every outcome abroad. Ultimately, freedom must benwon by the people themselves, not imposed from without. But we can and must standnwith those who so struggle. Because we have always believednthat the future of our children and grandchildren will be betternif other peoples children and grandchildren are morenprosperous and more free -- from the beaches of Normandynto the Balkans to Benghazi. That is our interestsnand our ideals. And if we fail to meetnthat responsibility, who would take our place,nand what kind of world would we pass on? Our action -- our leadershipn-- is essential to the cause of human dignity. And so we mustnact -- and lead -- with confidence in our ideals,nand an abiding faith in the character of our people,nwho sent us all here today. For there is one final qualitynthat I believe makes the United States and the UnitednKingdom indispensable to this moment in history. And that is how we definenourselves as nations. Unlike most countriesnin the world, we do not define citizenshipnbased on race or ethnicity. Being American or British is notnabout belonging to a certain group; its about believingnin a certain set of ideals -- the rights of individuals,nthe rule of law. That is why we hold incrediblendiversity within our borders. Thats why there are peoplenaround the world right now who believe that ifnthey come to America, if they come to New York,nif they come to London, if they work hard, they cannpledge allegiance to our flag and call themselves Americans;nif they come to England, they can make a new life nthemselves and can sing God Save  Queen justnlike any other citizen. Yes, our diversityncan lead to tension. And throughout our history therenhave been heated debates about immigration and assimilationnin both of our countries. But even as thesendebates can be difficult, we fundamentally recognize thatnour patchwork heritage is an enormous strength -- that inna world which will only grow smaller and more interconnected,nthe example of our two nations says it is possible  peoplento be united by their ideals, instead of dividednby their differences; that its possible  hearts tonchange and old hatreds to pass; that its possible  the sonsnand daughters of mer colonies to sit here as membersnof this great Parliament, and  the grandson of a Kenyannwho served as a cook in the British Army to standnbee you as President of the United States. () That is what defines us. That is why the young men andnwomen in the streets of Damascus and Cairo still reach  thenrights our citizens enjoy, even if they sometimesndiffer with our policies. As two of the most powerfulnnations in the history of the world, we must always remembernthat the true source of our influence hasnt just beennthe size of our economies, or the reach of our militaries,nor the land that weve claimed. It has been the values that wenmust never waver in defending around the world -- the ideanthat all beings are endowed by our Creator with certainnrights that cannot be denied. That is what ged our bondnin the fire of war -- a bond made manifest by thenfriendship between two of our greatest leaders. Churchill and Rooseveltnhad their differences. y were keen observers ofneach others blind spots and shortcomings, if notnalways their own, and they were hard-headednabout their ability to remake the world. But what joined the fates ofnthese two men at that particular moment in history was not simplyna shared interest in victory on the battlefield. It was a shared belief in thenultimate triumph of human freedom and human dignity -- anconviction that we have a say in how this story ends. This conviction lives onnin their people today.  challenges wenface are great.  work bee us is hard. But we have come throughna difficult decade, and whenever the tests andntrials ahead may seem too big or too many, let usnturn to their example, and the words that Churchillnspoke on the day that Europe was freed: ""In thenlong years to come, not only will the people of thisnisland but...the world, wherever the bird of freedomnchirps in the human heart, look back to what weve done,nand they will say do not despair, do not yield...nmarch straightward."" With courage and purpose,nwith humility and with hope, with faith in thenpromise of tomorrow, let us marchnstraightward together, enduring allies in the cause ofna world that is more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just. Thank you very much. () Speaker:nMr. President, I think thatnresponse describes far more eloquently than any words ofnmine could do how much that very memorable and inspiring addressnwas appreciated by everybody who heard it here today. You spoke -- () You spoke with great warmthnand great generosity about the British Parliament and thenBritish people and about the links that bind us, thenvalues and the traditions that we share.  history that we havenexperienced together. But more than that, younspoke too not just of the relationships of the past, butnthe relationships of the future. And I think that was what madenwhat you said so inspirational. It was a distinguished Americanngovernor of New York who remarked on the propensity ofnpoliticians to campaign in poetry, but to govern in prose.  world you described to usntoday was not just one that is prosaic; it was one where thenchallenges are difficult and sometimes dangerous. One that is fastnmoving, that is complex, sometimes contradictory. And that offers at least asnmany threats as opportunities. But in the eloquencenof your address, you reminded us of thenimportance of maintaining the poetry in government. Because to lead, thatnpoetry is necessary. Necessary not only tonarticulate the challenges, as you did so masterfully. But also to bring othersntogether to face those challenges with commonnprinciples and with shared purpose. Mr. President, it has been anprivilege  all of us to hear you speak today. It is a privilege  me to haventhe responsibility of thanking you on behalf of bothns of Parliament,  coming to Westminster, andnto wish you and Mrs.  a very happy and pleasantnrest of your stay in the United Kingdom. Thank you so much. ()"
39,0,"This is Central Park. It’s an iconic part of New York City. A piece of nature, tucked inside Manhattan. If you’ve lived in New York, or even visited, you’ve probably been here. But, there’s a part of this land’s story that visitors will never see. It’s the story of what was here bee the park. And the community that was destroyed to make way  it. In the 1820s, New York City looked like this. Most people lived in this area — Lower Manhattan. Pretty much everything above it, was yet to be settled. In this map, you can see how different thengeography was. se little lines illustrate what used to be hills in Manhattan. This was the countryside. Downtown was the opposite. Lower Manhattan was dense and crowded. A few small neighborhoods were home to many of the city’s poor whites, and immigrants. and also, to much of its black population. This document shows the number of slaves in New York State. You can see how it went down gradually, from 20,000 in 1800, to 10,000 in 1820, and finally to just 7 in 1830. That’s because in New York, slavery wasn’t abolished all at once. Instead, it was ended gradually over about 30 years. And as more free black people joined the work ce, racial tensions rose.  people who were enslaved were now in competitionnwith people coming over  jobs. That tension led to violence — and lower Manhattan became increasingly dangerous  free black people. n, in 182, plots of land started to go up  sale here, uptown. It was a way out. A black man named Andrew Williams decided to buy three lots. You know word gets out, black people, seeing other black people and say oh theres a little bit of a community developing here, maybe we can just fold into this community, so they start to move in. After Williams, more lots filled up with black families and churches. And it was here, between 82nd and 89th , that the community of Seneca Village was born. Moving up to Seneca Village offered black families, an afdable, safe place. It also gave them the chance to vote. Black men could only vote in New York if they owned property. Over the course of the next three decades, the community grew to nearly 300 residents. Records from the census show that they were laborers, domestic workers, waiters, and shoemakers. And they built dozens of homes, three churches, and a school  black students. Later, when Irish and German immigrants started moving into Seneca Village, it became unique  another reason. It was an integrated community. It seems that people of all ethnicities were likely getting along based on the church records that were here. Among the documents, are evidence that some white and black families attended baptisms together, were buried next to each other in the same cemetery, and intermarried.  people who lived in this area were individuals who were trying to find a new way of life. Over the next three decades, the population of New York City nearly quadrupled. Lower Manhattan could no longer hold everyone.  city’s white elite were worried that the entire island would be consumed by development. y said it called  the necessity of a city park, to “give lungs to the city”. This came out of the elite being able to start to travel to Europe and they see the Champs Elysees and they see Kensington Park and they think that the city deserves to have a park of that stature. On July 21, 183, New York set aside 70 acres of land to create America’s first major  landscaped public park. “ Central Park.” But the proposed area  the park included Seneca Village — along with thousands of  other lots of land, home to about 1600 people. In order to facilitate the park’s development, the city’s newspapers started to downplay who really lived there. y really describe these people as living in shanties and shacks, people of debased cultures were living off the land. But that wasn’t true. In 2011, Cynthia and a team of archaeologists excavated in the mer Seneca Village site. y came away with 20 bags of objects to analyze, which now live here, in New York City’s Archaeological Repository. se objects suggest that Seneca Village was wealthier than many assumed. When we compared the objects from the homes of the people in the village with artifacts from Greenwich Village, an elite upper middle class neighborhood. In some cases, they were using the same kind of ironstone plate in what was called the Gothic pattern. Quite a few pieces of porcelain in Seneca Village and porcelain was an expensive ware. y also found other objects — like a comb, a smoking pipe, roasting pan, and part of axa0 toothbrush, that probably didn’t belongnto poor people. Toothbrushes were not common among the working class as well as the middle class until around 1920. And the artifacts themselves were only one part of their analysis. For example, from the census records from 18, we know that there was a very high level of education. Getting a high school education was clearly an important factor in the community and that’s very much a part of middle class identity.  findings indicate that Seneca Village wasn’t a shantytown. It was a working and middle class community, a growing neighborhood of black property owners, and an experiment in integration. But to the white New York elite of 186, it wasn’t worth saving. A July 186 article in the New York Times referred to it with a slur. “ Ebon inhabitants, after whom the village is called...have been notified to remove by the first of August.” Many residents fought to keep their land by filing objections to their ced removal. But Seneca Village — along with the othernsettlements on the land  Central Park -- was seized and destroyed. In their place, the city made pathways,nbuilt bridges and arches, and planted thousands of trees. Central Park was done, and Seneca Village was gone ever. We cant imagine New York City without Central Park. But Im finally grateful that the recognition of the pre-park history has emerged. Today, New York is starting to reckon with this part of its history. An exhibition with inmation about Seneca Village is temporarily up in the park. But the real legacy of Seneca Village is a story that’s repeated itself again and again, in cities everywhere. Land, property ownership, Thats how you get wealth and you pass wealth on from generation to generation. But you’re getting a bulldozer that comesnthrough because a new highway has to come through or a new hospital or development sitenhas to come in. Seneca Village was no different. Its time that we own it and we come to recognize that there are these great stories that live beneath the surface of the park. Its not just African-American history. Its just American history."
40,0,"Every time there’s another mass shootingnin America — politicians have the same idea. It’s time to require a background checkn anyone who wants to buy a gun. I’m one of the Republicans who does believenthere should be background checks. It is an open secret that the existing backgroundncheck system is broken. Oh I have an appetite  background checks.nWe’re going to be doing background checks. Here’s what they want to change: Right now,ngun buyers in the US only have to go through a background check at a gun store. But they don’t have to go through one ifnthey buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer, like at a gun show or a private sale.nBut with universal background checks, everyone who buys a gun would go through one. Pretty much every American is in favor ofnthis. re’s only one problem. Universal backgroundnchecks won’t solve America’s gun crisis. But there’s something else that might. To understand how background checks work,nit helps to imagine two very different people, who both want to buy a gun. This first person is dangerous. Maybe he hasna history of domestic violence or mental illness. And most importantly — he has a record. And the second one is not dangerous. He justnwants a gun  protection or to go hunting or cause shooting guns is kinda fun. Bee either one can buy a gun, they first have to go through an FBI instant background check. And I mean instant — it only takes an averagenof 108 seconds to get a response from the FBI’s database. That database is made up of records sent innby state police and other agencies. And it’s checked to see if the buyer has things likena criminal record, addiction, a restraining order or has been hospitalized  a mentalnillness. Under a universal background check system,nanyone buying a gun — whether in a gun store, or through a private sale — would have tonbe checked through that database. That means our second person walks out with a gun.nAnd our first person, with a criminal record, doesn’t. Or, at least he shouldn’t. I’ve done a lot of reporting on this, wenhave just seen time and time again background checks just do not stop people we don’tnwant having guns from actually getting the weapons. re are a couple problems with the backgroundncheck system. One is that the FBI database is about as outdated as its logo. It’s missing millions of records. That’s why the Charleston church shooternwas able to buy a gun, despite having a record. Or why the man who killed 26 Texan churchgoersnwas also able to pass a background check, after the Air Force failed to send his domesticnabuse convictions to the FBI. So even with a background check  everyntype of sale, there’s still a chance this guy gets a gun. That’s partly why study after study hasnfound that while background checks “prevent, or make substantially more difficult, thencriminal acquisition of firearms.” Making them universal doesn’t actually havenany effect on the actual gun crisis in America: gun deaths. A Johns Hopkins study of Calinia, wherencomprehensive background checks were implemented in 1991, found the law was “not associatednwith changes in firearm suicide or homicide.” Thanks in part to those incomplete and missingnrecords.  other problem is that background checksnonly look at “good” people and “already bad” people. But there is an in between.  background checks are supposed to catchnpeople who have a record already. It just misses all the people who haven’t done anythingnbad yet but might do something bad in the future. German is not advocating  a Minority Reportnsituation. He’s talking about someone like this guy,nwho is also dangerous, but who doesn’t have a record. Under a universal background check systemn— he could get a gun. In 108 seconds. But there’s another system that could preventnthis. Twelve states and Washington, DC have gonenone step further and established a licensing system. How’s it different? Well, Here’s how itnworks in Massachusetts: Bee you ever go to a gun store, you firstnhave to take a firearm safety course. n you go to the police department and submitnan application, give references and give your fingerprints  a background check. n not only is the FBI database checked,nbut all local law encement agencies wherever you’ve lived are directly contacted, alongnwith the Department of Mental Health. That entire process in Massachusetts usuallyntakes about 3 weeks. And most people‚ about 97% — pass. Nothing about a gun licensing system willnprevent a law-abiding citizen from going through the process and obtaining a firearm. That’s Dr. Cassandra Crifasi, she researchesnhealth policy at Johns Hopkins, and she’s one of the authors of the studies earlier. And she says the reason licensing works isnthat it’s designed to do both of the big things background checks fail at. A, to properly identify and screen out peoplenwho shouldn’t have guns. And B, create a system to reduce impulsivengun purchases.  licensing system is more comprehensiventhan the one-database background check system, so our criminal will be reliably denied angun. But because it’s so meticulous it also standsna chance of keeping our third guy, without a record, from getting a gun. re are people who, may want to impulsivelynacquire a firearm,  example to harm themselves or others. And the process of obtaining a license cannat least delay that person during that time of crisis or maybe deter them from gettingnthat firearm at all. In 199, Connecticut implemented a licensingnsystem. Over the next 10 years, they saw a drop inngun homicides and gun suicides. Compare that to Missouri, which once had anlicensing system, but got rid of it in 2007. Over the next decade, they had a huge spikenin homicides and gun suicides. In both states there were lots of factorsninvolved. But researchers say this shows that licensing works. It’s also… pretty popular. Among votersnwho live in a house with a gun, more than two-thirds think that it’s a good idea.nAsk all Americans and more than three-quarters support it. Background checks are supposed to stop badnpeople from getting guns. But they often don’t. Licensing picks up that slack. By making sure that people are crossing these hurdles,nwe just make sure, in a much better, stronger way, that people are not getting firearmsnwhen they shouldn’t have them."
41,0,"In 1966, Mao Zedong had a problem.  Chinese leader who had led a peasant armynto victory in the Chinese Civil War, and established the communist People’s Republic of Chinanin 199, was getting old. Worse, his radical policies had devastatednthe country, and triggered the deadliest famine known to human history. By the early 1960s, Mao’s once-great influencenand public presence were at an all time low, and there were rumors that he was dying, orneven dead already. He needed to find a way to seal his legacynas the face of Chinese communism. And a new revolution to lead. It started in a river.  Great Leap Forward was a disaster. It was Mao’s 198 plan to quickly industrializenChina by working its massive peasant population nonstop. ARCHIVE: He promises to transm the People’snRepublic into an instant paradise through sheer ce of numbers. Forcing workers in the countryside to farmncrops on government-run communes. And millions more to manufacture crude steelnin homemade blast furnaces. And even though Mao told the world that thenplan was succeeding… : Everywhere, the communists report,nproduction records are being broken. … the truth was much more desperate. ARCHIVE: y flood the fields, exhaust thensoil, and farm production instead of going up, goes down.  Chinese people were being ced to workntirelessly on land they once owned themselves — and they were starting to lose morale. And despite reports of widespread famine,nwith millions of people starving to death, Mao kept production quotas high. ARCHIVE:  pace grows more frantic. Ceaselessly, without rest, one observer writes. Maos Great Leap Forward ended in 1962. By that time somewhere between 23 and  millionnpeople had died in the famine. Over in the Soviet Union, a different politicalnupheaval was happening. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who Mao modelednhimself after, was dead. And Mao watched as Nikita Krushchev, Stalin’snsuccessor, implemented a period known as “de-Stalinization.” Where Krushchev set out to reverse many ofnStalin’s policies and dismantle the personality cult that had med around him. Mao saw his own legacy potentially sufferingnthe same fate. His Communist Revolution was long over, andnhis ideas weren’t taken as seriously after the disaster of the Great Leap Forward. It was starting to look like Mao’s placenin the pantheon of powerful communist figures, like Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, was innperil. This is where the river comes in. Mao had a reputation  being a strong swimmer. And even used it as a symbol of his ideology. In 196, he swam across China’s biggestnriver, the Yangtze, in three highly-publicized swims. To demonstrate that big things – like USnimperialism – didn’t intimidate him. 10 years later, Mao took on the Yangtze again,nto dispel rumors of his failing health. This time with cheering crowds swimming alongsidenhim. He brought his personal photographer, whonsnapped this photo of the aging dictator in the river. And another one showing Mao waving to hisnfellow swimmers, with the landmark Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge behind him. An iconic architectural achievement of thencommunist government, and proof that he was at the Yangtze.  swim made the front page of China’snstate newspaper, reporting that Mao swam around 1 kilometers, a little more than 9 miles,nin a span of 6 minutes. Which meant the 72-year-old would have shatterednworld speed records. A lot of people outside of China laughed atnthe outlandish story, but some saw the swim  what it was: a sinister sign. Pointing out that Mao’s swims from a decadenearlier preceded the catastrophic Great Leap Forward. Experts feared that Mao was on the verge ofnkicking off another disastrous period of turmoil in China. y were right. Two months bee the swim, Mao had announcednthe beginning of his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A call to hunt down and eliminate the “bourgeoisienwho [had] sneaked into the party.” Basically to purge the government of anyonenwho strayed from principles of Maoism. And it kicked into high gear after his historicnswim. Which prompted a craze  swimming in sweptnChina, but more importantly, a craze  Mao. Especially among the group that Mao wantednto influence the most: China’s youth. Writer Liang Heng recalled that seeing Maonas “human flesh and blood” after the Yangtze swim resolved him to “serve him with allnhis heart.” Millions of Chinese youth organized into thenfanatical Red Guards, a paramilitary ce concentrated mostly in Chinese cities. And, with Mao’s blessing, they wreaked havocnin the name of Cultural Revolution. ir mission was to destroy the four olds: ARCHIVE: Old culture. Old ideology. Old customs.

Which they plastered all over the cities. And carried in their pockets in the m ofnMao’s “Little Red Book” a collection of his sayings and principles. And although the violent Red Guards were basicallyndissolved by 1969, the Cultural Revolution is considered to have continued until Mao’sndeath in 1976. Ending a decade of destruction that had elevatednthe leader to god-like levels. And resulted in over 1 million people dead.  chaos of the Cultural Revolution scarrednChina  generations. But Mao basically got what he wanted. Even though the Chinese Communist Party condemnednthe Cultural Revolution in 1981, and Chinese communism diverted away from Maoism, theyndidn’t denounce Mao himself.  Cultural Revolution solidified Mao’sncult of personality, and that influence has lasted. Mao’s swim, which is still commemoratedneach year in China, was more than a display of strength. It was a message: to get behind Mao as henbegan his last revolution."
42,0,"This is a chart that has never been seen bee. This one hasn’t either nor has this one. None of these have. That because I made them, along with Mattnhere. My name is Matt Daniels and Im a journalistnat the Pudding, which is a publication  visually led storytelling. Well, mainly Matt made them, I just sent himna bunch of emails. se charts are the result of a year longnobsession I’ve had over a very specific trend I’ve noticed in . Men singing really high. When I listen to the radio, I’ve come tonexpect one thing. Male pop stars exploiting their upper register. Bruno Mars,  Weekend, Shawn Mendes, CharlienPuth, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Adam Lavine, the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, Khalid,nChildish Gambino, Frank Ocean, all of One Direction, BTS, Chris Martin, One Republic,nand Sam Smith. I’m not the first person to pick up on this. In 201 alone it seemed every guy was singingnhigh. re was Jason Derulo “Just the thought of you, gets me so highn(so high)” Maroon  “I’m right here, cause I need a littlenlove a little sympathy” And Justin Bieber “Yeah, I know that I let you downnIs it too late to say Im sorry now?” But maybe this fact is best illustrated bynthis 10 week period on the Billboard Charts. When  Weekend battled  the top spotnagainst Justin Bieber “And I know shell be the death of me” “What do you mean?” And then Himself “I only call you when its half past five” until finally his Michael Jackson inspirednvoice was was dethroned by Adele’s “Hello.” “Hello, It’s Me” Really the only way to know if this hypothesisnholds up, though, is to crunch the numbers and quantify it. And that’s where Matt came in. It kind of fits a really good mold of thenquestions that I really like, where we have a cultural question about vocal ranges andnusage of falsetto and  and there is no perfect data set  that. We wanted to make a chart that showed hownprevalent the male falsetto was in pop , not just in the last  years, but as far backnas we could go. That meant looking at  streaming services. Every streaming platm tags the millionsnof songs in their respective libraries with metadata, but each one does it a little differently. For example, Spotify has over 3 millionsnsongs in their library, but their metadata is algorithmically driven and pretty broad. Matt: some of it was around the tempo of nand how danceable it was or its somber or positive tone. Pandora, on the other hand has a smaller library,nbut they are committed to very specific data. In their case it wasn’t algorithmicallyndriven. y were actually having humans review songsnand say what its DNA, or what its genome was.  result is a library of 2 million songsnwith up to 0 individual identifying markers. So that was interesting to me because falsettonand vocal range, while could be determined by a computer, often lends itself to the humannear because there is some subjectivity to it. So, we asked Pandora if they had vocal data. y did. And they shared it with us. So do you actually have available the originalndataset that we received? Oh yeah yeah I can. Should I just bring that up? Its ty two thousand rows.  first entry is by George P. Watson fromn1911 He was a Yodeler. One hundred and eight years later and 2,98nrows down we have the iconic high voice of Thom Yorke. Sudden words We’ll get to exactly how these are scorednin a bit, but damn that’s a lot of songs. So what we said was “OK this is great tonsee these ty three thousand songs but really we only care about songs that charted.” So we created a data set of the BillboardnHot 100, a 28,000 song list of the 100 most popular songs in the US every week since 198. and we went back to Pandora. And said we only really want the falsettondata  these songs, and not only do we want the falsetto data, but we alsonneed data about the register. And a few other important things, like thengender of the person singing. It’s not just a matter of like puttingninto their system and it spits out the falsetto data. We need to match the names of the songs andnthe artists names to whatever Pandora has. Wait. So you have to do that manually? We write fancy programs to guess that theresna match and confirm that theres a match. So with Matt’s fancy program we matchedn20,07 songs. So the biggest gap in the data is actuallynthe missing songs that arent on streaming services, but were on the Billboard Hot 100nand did have very valid falsetto data behind them. So in 198 we have data  0% of the songsnthat charted. In 2018 we have data  9% of the songsnthat charted.  good thing though is, you think of annaverage number one hit from 198 - thats more likely to appear on Pandora than a songnthat hit number 100  one week. When I first sat down with this giant spreadsheet,nI immediately wanted to see how songs that I thought had a lot of falsetto had actuallynbeen scored.  first song that I looked  was ChildishnGambino’s “Redbone.” “If you want it, you can have it, ohhhhhh” His voice is super high and very memorable. Not only that, a lot of articles about thisnsong mentioned it had a lot of falsetto. To my astonishment, Pandora determined therenwas no falsetto in the song, instead they said it was just sung in a high register This trend was most stark in the hard rocknand heavy metal genres. Def Leppard’s “Rock of Ages” had a falsettonscore of zero but register score of 9 out of 10. I dont care if it takes all nightnI gonna set this town alight, come on Knowing this, let’s define what falsettonand vocal register actually are. To do that I’ve brought in an actual operansinger. Hi Im Anthony Roth Costanzo and Im a countertenornand opera singer. Prove it. Perfect, let’s talk about vocal range first.  voices starting from the bottom in thenclassical tradition are bass, baritone, tenor, contralto, countertenor, mezzo soprano, Soprano. Countertenor is kind of a catch all term andnits a range that goes up and down. Most male pop stars today are tenors. That means their average range is somewherenbetween here and here. Pandora’s data scores vocal register - whichnmeasures a singers ability to go up and down their range consistently. A super high register Pandora rates songs from 0-10 from low tonhigh. “Rock of Ages” ranked super high withna 9 - Pharrell’s voice in “Get Lucky” wasngiven an 8 “I’m up all night to get some, she’snup all night  good fun, I’m up all night to get lucky” As was Elton John in “Crocodile Rock” “I never knew me a better time and I guessnI never will” So I think its safe to say that between an7 and 8 is pretty high on the vocal register range. But its not crazy. So when these artists want to access evennhigher notes they’ll likely switch to their falsetto register. Falsetto is an Italian word which means “falsenlittle voice.” Falsetto is typically a technique ascribednto a male singer that switches from their chest voice to their head voice. Whenever youre going from chest voice - meaningnthe speaking register - to head voice, theres often a little break because there are twondifferent sets of muscles handing off to each other, and thats how you yodel right. [demonstrates yodeling] And thats what yodelingnis. George, you’re back! It’s not just Yodeling. It happens in pop all the time, though thatntransition is often more invisible. Notice how Freddie Mercury goes from his chestnvoice to falsetto when he says the word “decline” “A built-in remedynFor Kruschev and Kennedy At anytime an invitationnYou cant decline” Okay so let me just pause  a second andnsay that “falsetto,” as a term, has been around ever, but its definition has changed andnevolved. Many vocal coaches would say that falsettonis that breathy, light sound you heard from Freddie Mercury. And they say the generic term “head voice”nshould describe crisper, reinced high notes. A perfect example of that is from this 90snclassic. “I knew I loved you bee I met you. I knew I loved you.” Thats amazing. I mean you know thats like a really wellnintegrated instrument. For your average  listener, aka me, thentechnical distinction between head voice and falsetto is less important than the fact thatnthey both just sound impossibly high. That brings us again to the scoring system. A 10 on the Pandora scale is a song that’snsung entirely in Falsetto “Staying alive” That’s pretty extreme, and according to our data set, it’s also prettynrare. So here’s the tricky determination I’vengot to make. What falsetto score is enough to really definena song. I think a good place to start is a song literallyncalled “Falsetto” “Now I got her talking like this, in a falsetto. She’s like oooh oooh baby ahh ah ah” Pandora gave this song a 6 - in their ears,n-Dream only used the technique moderately. This is where I could split hairs all day. Because while, yeah, -Dream doesn’t usena falsetto the whole time, the technique plays does play a central role in the track.  hook of the song, the most memorable part,nis sung in falsetto. Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River”nalso got a 6. “Cry me a river (go on and just)nCry me a river (go on and just) Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)” So, I’m going to look at songs with a falsettonabove a  If there’s one thing I can’t stress enough,nit’s that this data can be addressed in a 1,000 different ways. To keep things simple, though we’ve separatednfalsetto and vocal register as two separate data points. I think this is probably the first chart Inmade that just was super simple and just said all right “What is the average value ofnall the songs that charted in a year.” First lets focus on vocal register. I was not expecting to see this just a verynclear like march to the top in the late 80s  average vocal register  male singernin 1988 was a 7.1. But as you can see across any time period,nthat average never really dropped below .. Because there were so many songs in 1988 thatnhad a register of 7 or higher, we’re going to make this a little bit tougher. I’m going to boost the register to an 8nand only allow songs that made it in the top 10. We’ve got a strong hard rock and heavy metalnshowing. “Shes got a smile it seems to me” re’s my man Phil Collins “Im always right there beside hernWere two hearts” I’ve literally never heard this song “I can rocket 2 u” Okay, wow. If we push the Falsetto score up to a 6, we’renleft with just two songs from 1988. “Smooth Criminal”n“He came into her apartment He left the bloodstains on the carpet” and “Nite and Day” by Al B Sure! “I can tell you how I feel about you nightnand day” With Nite and Day just barely edging out tonwin.  1980s blew a high male vocal registernout of the water. So let’s see how this chart changes whennwe just focus on falsetto. Things start to shift going back from then1980s to the 1970s - the disco era. 197 was the highest year  falsetto. Where 18% of songs had a value over . It also serves as a turning point  thenBee Gees. This might be surprising to hear, but been197 the Bee Gees’s average falsetto was around 0.8. After 197 it rose to a .. And that makes sense. y had to compete with the likes of Earth,nWind, and Fire, Ohio Players, Eddie Kendricks, Curtis Mayfield - all artists whose careersnwere defined by their high voices. I can imagine a record executive in a roomnlistening to a song and theyre like “Yeah thats great but you should put some falsettonin there somewhere” It wasn’t until 1976 that their now trademarknfalsetto hit number one. “You should be dancing, yeah” Looking back at both of these charts, it’snobvious something shifted after the 1980s.  thing that changed after the 80s is younhave hip hop becoming massively popular. And today its the most popular genre. If you look at the average song there justnisnt as many opportunities   a falsetto because theres just less singing. So how do we account  that? So I created this toggle that basically saidnis there singing in this song which is also from the Pandora data, they basically havena spoken variable. So first let’s see what happens when wentoggle the singing function  songs in the top 10. 1996 and 201 really shoot up. Let’s focus on 1996 first. This was the year Neo-Seoul went mainstream. Artists like D’Angelo and Maxwell led thencharge. ir voices were a modern twist on the soulnartists of the 1970s. I mean just listen to D’Angelo next to CurtisnMayfield. “When I first saw you babynI wanted to die Me and those dreamin eyes of mine” “So In Love, every time we kiss” 2n1996 was a huge year  Falsetto, but so was 201. And here are maybe your your your ears hearingnthe right thing, relative to other years, 201 was the year of high voices. Regardless of which toggle we select or whichncombination of falsetto and register we choose, we did find this: if a song has falsetto,nwhether it’s a 1 or a 10, it’s going to chart higher — and longer. This is true across nearly every year. Not only that, Top 10 Hits are more likelynto use falsetto. Take a look at that huge spike in 201. 66% of songs that peaked in the top 10 hadnfalsetto. Regardless of the decade, high male voicesnare iconic. From the Frankie Vallie belting Sherry “Sherry baby” To the 70s swagger of Bloodstone’s “NaturalnHigh” “Im trying to make something out of nothingnAnd I dont even know you” To the Weeknd’s hazy R&B “None of these toys on lease too, ahnMade your whole year in a week too, yah” It feels like today is very good  the commercialnviability of the high male voice. And I think thats true if the window of time is the millennials lifetime. But if you were to talk to your parents ornyour parents parents theyd be like Oh you think today is good. In nineteen seventy five its not even comparable.  reason why it might feel like a trendntoday is because this is all weve ever known."
43,0,"Something terrible happened here. And  decades, people didn’t talk aboutnit. “I was an adult bee I ever heard aboutnit. It was something that was hidden.” “This entire historic community was obliterated.” “Bodies dumped in rivers bodies dumped innmass graves. It was an absolute massacre.” This story isn’t one you’ll find in mostnhistory books. And almost 100 years later, the facts of whatnexactly happened that day...are still unraveling. “So we’re driving in what’s known asnBlack  . It’s where one of the nation’s worst episodesnof racial violence took place.” In 1921 — a neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahomancalled the Greenwood District, was a bustling community of black-owned businesses. Tulsa locals know that period of Greenwood’snhistory as a kind of Golden Age. “If you can imagine just like an old timendowntown, things like movie theaters, pharmacys, hair salons, and so th.” y called it, “Black  ”. “It was a mecca, it was a huge success.” But Black   was also an anomaly. It thrived at a time when the KKK was incrediblynactive in Oklahoma and the nation had just been through the “Red Summer of 1919”n— when white mobs murdered black people in dozens of incidents across the US. “re needed to be a sort of match or annigniter tossed on these embers and that event was, that trigger event, was an incident thatninvolved two teenagers: Dick Rowland, 19-year-old black boy who shined shoes downtown. Sarah Page, 17-year-old white girl who rannan elevator in a downtown building called the Drexel Building. He went to the building boarded the elevator. Something happened. Sarah Page began to scream. y both ran out of the elevator.” Now we don’t know exactly what happenednin this elevator — but a day later, Rowland was arrested and taken to the courthouse.  local newspaper ran an article claimingnRowland had assaulted Page. Even though Page refused to press charges, thenarticle was essentially a call to action  whites. “A large white mob began to gather on thenlawn of the courthouse. Dick Rowland was in jail on the top floor. A number of black men, several dozen, marchedndown to the courthouse to protect him. Some of them armed. re was a struggle between one of the blacknmen in the small group and one of the white men in a larger group. And things sort of went south from from thatnpoint.” Hundreds of white people descended upon Blackn , armed. Black residents withdrew behind the railroadntracks that marked off the Greenwood district. Some of them were armed, and fought back. But they were outnumbered by the white mob, whichnshot their way through.  white mob murdered. y looted. And they set fire to Black  . “This was the strategy, if you will, ofnhow to deal with these successful black communities.  effects were disastrous.” For two days, the Greenwood district burned. Martial law was declared. And the National Guard was brought in. By the time the massacre ended, Greenwoodnwas in ruins. More than 1200 homes were destroyed, and 3nblocks, burned.  exact number of casualties is harder tonpin down. Some initially only reported that white peoplendied. Others, reported somewhere between 30 andn100 mostly black casualties. But estimates now put that number closer ton300. As  those that survived, thousands of themnlived in tents cities in the months that followed...and were left to pick up the pieces of rubblenthey once called home. After the massacre, the cover up started. Records went missing from city files — includingnthe very article that started it all. It makes photos from this time all the morenimportant as part of the historical record. But back in 1921, these images served a veryndifferent purpose. “So photo postcards like these were widelyndistributed after the massacre. At the time they were a part of white supremacistnculture, and kept as souvenirs of racially charged crimes.” Now, they’re preserved to make sure thisnpart of Tulsa’s history isn’t gotten — and they paint a clear picture of hownmuch destruction there was that day. On the postcards, it’s called “ TulsanRace Riot” — a name that, itself, sort of erases what really happened. “By calling it a riot, xa0its a way of tryingnto rewrite the history, assuming that there were both sides at fault and that was notnthe case. I call it a massacre and I call it that, because that’s whatnit was.” Greenwood eventually rebuilt. But nearly a century later, there’s a partnof this story that still haunts the city. No one actually knows where the victims’nbodies are. “We’ve got to find our people weve gotnto put them at rest. If not we continue to be haunted by what wasndone so many years ago.” Kavin Ross, a local writer, is one of manynin Tulsa, descended from people who lost everything in the massacre. “So in this cemetery there are only twonofficial victims of the Tulsa race massacre. How many victims do you think there are?” “After all these years, I think 300 is puttingnit mild.” In 1997, the city finally put together a commissionnto study the massacre, and help piece together what happened in 1921. y compiled records, and eyewitness accounts. “ bullets were just raining down overnus.” “y set our house on fire and went rightnstraight to the curtains and set the curtains on fire.” se accounts are especially important nown— because none of these survivors are alive anymore. And they also provided new inmation. Some mentioned trucks - like this one - loadednwith victims of the riot. One riot witness in particular came th, testifying that he saw bodies being dumped in Oaklawn Cemetery. “This is it. This is the area.” Using the survivor accounts, records, andneventually, radar — xa0the city was able to pinpoint three locations with anomaliesnin the soil. Only one step was left, to excavate. But it was something the city, at the time,nwasn’t up  doing. For many Tulsans, it was a part of historynbest gotten, and not worth investigating. In some ways, today, that sentiment remains. “Kind of a waste of money."" ""Why do you think that?"" ""It’s over. Its done with."" But there are clear signs of a city that’snready to come to terms with a dark chapter in its history. “Honestly that’s a lot of missing people,npeople that probably had families.” “We owe it to the people who whose bloodnhas actually fertilized the grounds of this place.” “re was a tremendous amount of racism” “Injustice plus time does not equal justice.” Today, a new mayor is re-opening the investigation. “I think a pretty basic compact that a citynmakes with its citizens is, if somebody murders you we will do everything we can to find outnwhat happened to you and give your family closure. Whether you were murdered yesterday or younwere murdered 98 years ago.”  city will be looking into the three areasnthat the commission noted. That process — of xa0finding out what liesnbeneath Tulsa — and DNA matching any remains with descendants, could take years.  investigation is just one part of a biggernhistorical reckoning. But the reality is, it cant undo the crimes or the cover upnof the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. “This story is the greatest conspiracy ofnsilence that Ive ever seen in history.” “Thanks  watching.

44,0,"Its more expensive to live in Hong Kongnthan anywhere in the world. Hong Kong has been ranked the least afdable housingnmarket in the world eight years in a row and by a long shot. Housing prices are now almost 20 times more than annual income. That means thatna household making $0,000 USD would on average be looking na house that cost $980,000 USD. And its getting really bad. Hundreds of thousands of residents now squeeze into incrediblynsmall apartments, most of them no bigger than a parking space. So these are cagenhomes, which basically fit one person and their belongings. And they basicallynstack these in a room in order to fit as many people as they can in the room.nAnd yet the price per square foot  these smaller houses just keeps shootingnup. I visited these homes to try to piece together an explanation  this trendnand to meet the people who are being squeezed by the worlds least afdablenreal estate market. re are now tens of thousands ofnpeople in this city who live in spaces that are between 7 and 10 square feet.nFor some perspective a typical parking space in the US is 120 square feet. One of the most common strategies  small space living is this subdivided house model. This big space thats been divided up into a bunch of tiny littlenliving spaces. se people basically have room  a bed and a table and anfew belongings. What makes this model work is that they have a biggerncommunal space where theyre able to have their cooking and their washing andnthe bathroom open to everyone, so that they can save space and save money inntheir actual living quarters. So this is the kitchen  this space which isnshared by four families.  temptingnexplanation here  why the prices are so high is land scarcity. You know, seven and a half million people crammed into this series of islands, its gonna drive upnthe prices.  same story in a lot of places that have run out of land thatnare in high demand — in San Francisco or New York City. Okay this might be thenstory in New York City and San Francisco, but is Hong Kong actually running out ofnland? Lets see what the drone says about this. Flying over Hong Kong you start tonsee that, while yes, theres a very dense urban landscape, theres also a whole lotnof green space. Government land-use data says that 7 percent of the land in HongnKong is not developed. Now some of that is mountainous and rocky and not easy tonbuild on, but certainly not all of it. So I posed this question about densitynto two experts, one is a Hong Kong citizen and the other is a 30-plus yearnresident. Both are advocates  better urban design. Are high prices primarilynthe result of land scarcity? No. No. res a land-use issue, because alsonland is being inefficiently used or conserved.  problem isnt the shortagenof land the problem is bad land management. Land use, land management, whatnthese experts are referring to is that of all the land in Hong Kong only 3.7% is zoned  urban housing. But its not because ofnmountains, its because of policy and this gets to the heart of thenexplanation of why more and more people are living in homes the size of parkingnspaces.  first thing to note if you want to understand the real explanation,nis that the government owns all of the land in Hong Kong. Well, all except nthis one church that the British built here when they ruled it back in the 1800snand it kind of just escaped the whole government-owns-all-the-land thing. So the government owns all the land and it leases it out to developers, usually n0 years in an auction process where the highest bidder gets the contract. Withnsuch scarce and valuable land zoned  housing, real estate companies more andnmore of them coming from mainland China with lots of money, will duke it out innthese auctions. And will end up at an astronomically high price. Like this plot of land that was just leased out  2.2 billion dollars, whichnset an all-time record  the most expensive land of ever leased by the HongnKong government to a developer. So the way the government zones and leasesnland is the first part of this.  other part of this explanation has a lot to donwith taxes. If youre the type of person who navigates away from this video whennyou hear the word tax policy, stay with me here. This place loves lowntaxes. Its a great place to do business, because the corporate tax is lownno value-added tax, no sales tax, free market economics, low taxes. Thatsnembedded into the fabric of this place. Look at all those low taxes doing theirnwork, building up those skyscrapers, slapping on those bank logos all overntown. So if the government isnt getting revenue from taxes, it really needs it fromnanother source and in the case of Hong Kong that source is land sales. A lot of the government revenues here driven by land revenues and its about 30% of government public financing income.  government of Hong Kong cannlease out this land to developers at astronomical prices, make a ton ofnrevenue from that and not have to raise taxes on the people or the corporationsnthat reside here and they still proudly retain their rankingnas the freest economy on earth. What this means is that the Hong Kong governmentndoesnt have a huge incentive to free up more land and lower prices, but whilenthis current arrangement of bidding and auctions is really good  revenue nthe government and good  the market generally, its not super good  thenpeople of Hong Kong. Of all the small spaces, this is easily the most cramped. se arencoffin homes. Could I ask you just a quick question about your living space?  government is slowly working on thisnproblem. Year after year new policies come innthat are meant to fix this, but theyre slow to change, mainly because they havenan incentive to keep the status quo as it is. Out here at this industrialncomplex in Hong Kong, I met with a guy named Eric Wong, a local inventor andnbusinessman who has seen a business opportunity in the midst of this spacencrisis. Eric grew up in Hong Kong and has beennthinking about small-space living  a long time. Oh it has WiFi. se capsules come in one or two-person sizes and are meant to provide a morenefficient and hygienic version of the cage and coffin homes, all at anrelatively low price. Down here theres a little box where you can put all yournvaluables and so theres mirror lights, theres reading lights. But these capsules,ninnovative as they are, really just put a band-aid on this housing problem.ny dont serve as a real solution. A real solution would need to come fromnsomething thats much less profitable and fun to look at: Government policy andnzoning rem that will free up more land and put the interests of the peoplenabove the interests of the market, but until the government can make thatnhappen people in Hong Kong will continue to squeeze into smaller and smallernspaces."
45,0,"Everyone in this photo died soon after itnwas taken. se are British explorers standing at thenSouth Pole in January 1912.  photo marks the finish line of a raceninto the unknown. Two teams, one British, one Norwegian, trekkedn900 miles into brutal territory and had to get back to safety bee winter hit. And at first glance, this looks like a victorynphoto  the British. Except that is the Norwegian flag. And it only gets worse from here. Robert Falcon Scott was a meticulous planner. And his dream was to be the first person tonreach the South Pole. He and his English team of explorers and scientistsnhad been conducting research in Antarctica and collected years of data on seasonal cyclesnon the continent. se lines show what they estimated averagentemperatures would be throughout the year, with summer ranging from around 30 to negativen10 degrees Fahrenheit, and huge drops beginning around April. Remember this chart because later, it willnhelp us understand Scott’s decision-making. Scott planned to use pony transport  thenfirst 2 miles across the Ross Ice Shelf, shoot them at the base of the Beardmore Glacier,nand finish the rest of the journey on foot. Which included a 12-mile hike across thentop of the glacier, 30 more miles to the pole, and all the way back again, all whilenhauling hundreds of pounds of equipment. Using ponies and brute strength made sensento Scott at the time: British explorers had used this method tonhaul equipment during an earlier attempt on the South Pole. Plus, the English didn’t have experiencenwith the other good option: dog teams. And they believed man-hauling was the surestnway to make the tricky climb up the glacier and on to the Polar Plateau, where the SouthnPole sits. It was hard, slow work, but the route theynwere on had reached the plateau bee, and it seemed to be worth the eft. But Scott’s team wasn’t alone. Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was campednnearby. And he wanted to get to the pole first.  Norwegian team, all of them expert skiers,nknew how to travel in cold conditions. And to make matters worse  the English,nAmundsen had dogs — and he knew how to use them.  of the Norwegians’ last-minute bidnworried Scott, but he was still optimistic. Amundsen had started about 60 miles closernto the pole but was taking a route not yet proven to be passable. Coming against an unknown obstacle or falling into an unmarked crevasse could end his attempt prematurely. But that’s not how it happened. By the time Scott reached his goal, Amundsen’snflag was there waiting  him.  Norwegians and their dogs had comtablynreached the pole five weeks earlier and were almost back to their starting pointnby the time the English arrived. Scott and his team were heartbroken. y took this photo outside of Amundsen’sntent the day they started their long journey back. Scott wrote: Left a note to say I had visited the tentnwith companions. Bowers photographing and Wilson sketching. We have turned our back now on the goal ofnour ambition and must face our 800 miles of solid dragging — and good-bye to most ofnthe daydreams! This is where the trouble really begins. It’s mid-January in this photo — still the height of the Antarctic summer. Told you this chart was coming back. According to their research, the team hadnabout 3 months left bee temperatures on the Ross Ice Shelf, the last leg of the journeynback, would drop to deadly levels. That left plenty of time to make the longntrek on foot. But this isn’t what happened in 1912. This is that average line again, and thesenare the temperatures Scott’s party endured that summer: consecutive days of temperaturesnaround minus 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Those conditions, at prolonged exposure, arennot survivable.  first man died here — he collapsed andnsoon went comatose following several falls on the glacier.  next man died about a month later, afterncrippling frostbite in his hands and feet began hurting the team’s progress and theirnchances of survival. Nearly unable to walk, he left the tent andnsacrificed himself to a snowstorm.  last three, including Scott, made it herenbee getting trapped in their tent by a blizzard, just 11 miles from the supply depot that wouldnhave saved their lives.  tent, along with the bodies, journals,nand photographs, was found 8 months later by a search team. As time went on, Scott’s legacy vacillatednbetween fearless explorer and bumbling fool who tried to take ponies into the Antarctic. But the thing is his plan should have worked. Measurements from modern weather stationsnalong his route show the predictions he was relying on were impressively accurate. What Scott couldn’t have known is that 1912nwas an anomaly — the temperatures his party suffered through occur roughly once everyn1 years, turning an already risky venture into a hopeless one.  photo they took outside of Amundsen’sntent was meant to be a gentlemanly admission of defeat at the end of a long race. But instead, it was the starting line of anrace they didnt see coming — a desperate attempt to escape from the coldest place onnEarth.

46,0,"Sadie Pfeifer was 9 years old when this photonwas taken. Operating heavy machinery that’s nearlyntwice her height in a cotton mill in Lancaster, South Carolina, in 1908. She was just one of many children workingnin mills, fields, factories, and mines. And although these kids were spread acrossnthe United States, working in separate industries, they all had one thing in common: y all met Lewis Hine. At the turn of the 20th century, the UnitednStates knew it had a child labor problem.  1900 federal census revealed that 1.7nmillion children under the age of 16, more than one in five, were working at this time.  Industrial Revolution had mechanized Americannand European manufacturing, and a cheap labor ce was needed to complete repetitive tasksn hours on end. Children from poor families were targetedn these jobs because they would work  next to nothing and were less likely to strikenthan adults. State legislatures and the American publicnknew this was happening on a mass scale, but didn’t act. Until they saw what it actually looked like. Starting in 1908, the newly med NationalnChild Labor Committee hired a photographer to investigate and report on the industriesnemploying children. That photographer was Lewis Wickes Hine: educator,nsociologist, and member of the Progressive Movement. A period in the United States that saw a wavenof political activism and social rem. Hine emphasized the potential power of photographynas a tool  social rem in a speech he gave in 1909 called “Social photography:nhow the camera may help.” He said, “ dictum, then, of the socialnworker is “Let there be light;” and in this campaign  light we have  our advancenagent the light writer — the photograph.” He traveled extensively, gathering inmation,ninterviews, and images of working children across the country. He visited coal mines in Pennsylvania. Where adolescent “breaker boys” workednunderground  hours, separating impurities from coal. Sardine cutters in Maine. Oyster shuckers in Louisiana, some as youngnas  years old. Tobacco pickers in Kentucky. Cranberry pickers in Massachusetts. Beet farms in Colorado. And young messengers and newsboys in citiesnall over the country. Many of the photos captured adults nearby,nsupervising the children while they worked. When Hine wasn’t allowed access to the millsnand factories, he waited outside and documented the comings and goings of itsnworkers, whose shifts often lasted late into the night. Laborers would pose  portraits and tellnHine a bit about themselves, their wages, and their work conditions. Sometimes they showed their horrific injuriesnand described what happened, like this boy from Bessemer City, North Carolina, whosenhand got crushed in the gears of a cotton spinner. We know that because each photo, numberingnover ,000, includes a detailed caption written by Hine. Hine coined the term “photo stories” tondescribe this marriage of images and text, and it’s a big part of how the photos humanizednthe lives of child laborers to an indifferent public. But it’s also his photographic techniquenthat makes them feel so personal. Let’s use the photos of cotton mill workersnlike Sadie as an example. First, many of these photos are framed thenexact same way, just substituting a different worker. Hine was trying to show that each child’snexperience was part of a widespread problem, and the repetition in the images signals that. You can really see how intentional the framingnis when you look at how the image of Sadie appeared when it was first published in anProgressive magazine, in 1909. It’s opposite a nearly identical photo ofna different worker, set so that the symmetry of the two images makes the machinery seemnto go on and on.  left-hand caption says, “Spinner. A type of many in the mill.” Hine’s photographs are also shot with anvery shallow depth of field, which basically means a narrow part of the photo is in focus,nand the rest is blurred out. A photo with a deep depth of field would looknlike this one by Jacob Riis, who was photographing New York City slums around the same time asnHine. Notice how the playground in the backgroundnis in focus, just like the kids in the eground. Now look at Hine’s portraits. In this one, the factory this boy works atnlooms behind him, but it’s almost totally blurred out. This was a recurring visual theme — to includenthe machinery or the workplace in the frame, but obscure it, favoring the worker instead. This narrow point of focus, combined withnshooting from a lower angle — the eye level of these children — is why these imagesnare so effective at humanizing their subjects. Photos like the ones from the South Carolinancotton mills changed the public perception of child labor in the United States, ultimately pressuring state legislatures tonintroduce laws regulating work  those under the age of 18 — and sending kids back tonschool. Lewis Hine went on to photograph the constructionnof the Empire State Building in New York City, using the same dignifying techniques he photographednchild laborers with: Considering the perspective of his subjects with a narrow focus, emphasizing the worker,nnot the machinery. Hine was one of the first to use a cameranas a tool  social documentary, to shine a light on the mostly unseen. He understood early on the power images havento tell stories. As he said in that 1909 speech: “Take the photograph of a tiny spinner inna Carolina cotton mill. With a picture thus sympathetically interpreted,nwhat a lever we have  the social uplift.” Hey everyone, that was Darkroom season 1!

47,0,"When I say “funeral” this is probablynwhat you think of, right?  cemetery, the casket, the gorgeous floralnarrangements. Vin Diesel stylishly going two buttons undonenon the dress shirt. But what if I told you that other than DominicnToretto’s eftless style, this was probably the worst way you couldndispose of a body? This traditional casket in the ground methodnmost of us are used to is what journalist Mark Harris calls a “modernnburial.” And that is the chemical embalming of thenremains, the burial of the body or the placement ofnthe body into a metal casket, and then the placing of that casket and embalmednbody in the bottom of the grave that we call thenburial vault. So that’s pretty much the American way ofndeath. Aside from being a great name  a novel, the American way of death actually turns outnto be pretty terrible.  average cost of modern burial runs onnaverage from $10,000 to $12,000. Although you can talk to families who willntell you they paid a lot more than that. In many cases, a lot more. This KISS casket alone will set you back sevenngrand. No word on if the amps are included though.  funeral industry has also been known tonengage in predatory business practices, like selling vulnerable families add-ons andnservices that they don’t need. y’ve also been the subject of a numbernof class action lawsuits, including one  conspiring to fix the pricesnof caskets at artificially high prices. “Modern” burials are also incredibly wasteful.  average grave site takes up 32 squarenfeet of land in a cemetery. And that’s just space. It uses a staggering amount of resources asnwell. Which nalmost sounds kind of fun right? Grill up some hotdogs, toss some diving ringsnin  the kids to fetch. Not so fast. Formalin, which is the maldehyde-basednpreservative solution embalmers use, is incredibly toxic. OSHA deems it a dangerous carcinogen and strictlynregulates its use, and the EPA treats it as a hazardous waste. Embalmers experience higher levels of brain,ncolon, and prostate cancer as well as leukemia. To embalm a typical body it requires 3 poundsnof this malin solution and sends 120 gallons of untreated “funeralnwaste” directly into the sewage system, including blood, water, fecal matter, organnfluid, and carcinogenic chemicals, as well as whatever unknown diseases the bodyncontains. Okay cool, so modern funerals suck. But what are the other options? Well, let’s start with cremation. Countries all across the world cremate bodies. In Great Britain, 7% of people get cremated, in Switzerland it’s 8%, and in Japan that number is almost 100%. Two years ago,  the first time in thisncountry’s history, more Americans were cremated than buried and then pretty soon we’re going to hitn0% of Americans being cremated. For one thing, it’s a lot cheaper. A typical cremation costs around $1,00 comparednto the $10,000 to $12,000 price tag we mentioned earlier. (Again, a little more  that sweet KISSncasket.) Cremating a body also requires much less space, since there doesn’t need to be a grave. And it doesn’t require a swimming pool fullnof maldehyde either … sorry kids. You can also do all sorts of fun stuff withnyour ashes like put them in fireworks, spread them in a National Park, or even turn them into a reef. But is it actually better n the environment? So it sounds like cremation is better, althoughnit’s far from perfect. Is there no way to do this without hurtingnthe environment? Swedish scientists asked that same questionnand developed something called promession. It’s a process where you freeze a corpsenin liquid nitrogen, rapidly vibrate the body so it breaks intonmillions of tiny particles in just a few minutes, then freeze dry the particles and remove thenharmful metals leftover from your dental fillings. You’re left with a fine dust which actuallynlooks very similar to cremated remains. It solves most of the problems of “modern”nburial and cremation but untunately hasn’t been approved nhuman beings yet. Another option is alkaline hydrolysis, where a body is put into a chamber which isnthen filled with water and lye, pressurized, and heated up to about 320 °F.  body tissue is broken down in a processnthat’s similar to natural decomposition, and dissolved to nothing but a skeleton innabout 12 hours. Damn, spooky. It’s more environmentally friendly sincenthere’s zero toxic emissions and it has about one-tenth of the carbon footprintnas a cremation. All that said, the simplest option might bennatural burial. A number of natural cemeteries have sprungnup across the country where unembalmed bodies are buried in biodegradablencontainers, or sometimes nothing at all, and allowed tondecompose naturally. It’s inexpensive, natural, and can actually help preserve and restorenvulnerable land and wildlife. Not to mention it’s how humans have donenit  most of recorded history. No matter what the method, though, it’snclear that we have to rem the way that we bury the dead. In less than a quarter-century 76 millionnpeople in America alone will get to the average life expectancy ofn78 years. If all those people were buried in traditionalngraves, wed need a cemetery the size of Las Vegasnto accommodate their bodies.  point is, were all going to die.  question is, what are we going to do withnall the bodies?"
48,0,"Frasier and Friends and Caroline in the Citynand Murphy Brown and I Love Lucy all have one thing in common. No, it’s not all the audience . y all kind of look…the same. And the shots and lighting all are kinda thensame. se are three camera sitcoms, with verynfamiliar camera angles and lighting. And the guy who perfected the style of lightnthat would one day shine upon Urkel’s face? “Did I do that?” It’s Karl Freund.  same guy who made...this. He was the German cinematographer behind thenlook of “Metropolis,” the 1927 classic. And there was actually a good reason thatna genius decided that going from this to this was a challenge worth betting hisncareer on. This right here is cinematic history. It’s from 192’s “ Last Laugh.” For this movie, Karl Freund invented whatnwas probably the first dolly shot in history - that’s when a camera moves on a cart orna track. When Freund moved from Germany to Hollywood,nhe continued to make visual masterpieces from directing the original “ Mummy,” tonbeing the cinematographer on “Dracula.” This scene from Dracula is emblematic of hisnwork, with shadows and light serving as powerful tools in the scene. With 1937’s “ Good Earth,” he wonnan Academy Award  Cinematography. Freund’s art came from powerful imagerynand stark contrasts, like in this scene from Metropolis. I Love Lucy looked good - but pretty flat. That’s why it’s so surprising that henthought it could be a breakthrough. We know Freund was nervous about making antransition from movies like this to television filmed in front of a live audience. Traditional movie lighting wouldnt work innthat environment and on a tight TV schedule. Heres why. Dramatic lighting is cool. But if I move, the way people move in sitcoms,nI lose the light and the shot. You also cant reset and move that light in frontnof a live audience.  shot also has to be lit so that it can be shownnby three different cameras at the same time. That challenge appealed to Freund, and, laughntrack jokes aside, he wrote that a live studio audience had “an astonishing effect in stimulatingnpermers.” re were earlier experiments with live taping,nbut Freund perfected it. You can see how he did it in I Love Lucy’snvery first episodes and in this on set picture. First, he put three cameras on his trademarkndollies - which is why these are called three camera sitcoms. Usually it has one camera in the middle, nwide shots, and two on the sides  closeups. You can see it here, as well as in the tapenhe used to mark the cameras’ positions. This is how it worked — letting camerasnmove on the fly, without relighting. Cameramen coordinated at all times using headsetsnand they were connected to the control room. To light this set up, Freund used an overheadngrid of lights like these and even put floor lights on the bottom of each camera to flatternactors’ faces. This? This is not like I Love Lucy. He also placed microphones around the setnso they wouldn’t get in the way. Lucy and Ethel could bounce around the livingnroom without needing to stop taping — or stop the . All of this let them keep a strict shootingnschedule with minimum reshoots after the show. For Freund, all this visual work was in servicenof making one sound possible. This is still kind of how it’s done today. Freund’s tricks established a template nthe three camera sitcom that’s still in use today. As you can see it in “”n- the first workplace sitcom where people actually work. Anyway, as you can see, there’s no neednto relight Dean as he crosses the room in this scene, only to be ignored by Ashley, because shes too busy working. Freund’s techniques did have drawbacks,nsome of those drawbacks are visible in today’s sitcoms, and some are specific to the timenin which he worked. He had to put darker makeup on his actorsnso they wouldn’t be blown out by the lights - and you can see it on Lucy and Ethel here. In this scene, they were probably wearingnpastel clothing as well, because nothing could be too bright — film processing gave everythingnhigher contrast than normal. Even today the three camera sitcom hasna less adventurous look — as you can see as AJ and Ashley go through all their unread emails. It affects focus, too - look at the Big Bangnory next to its prequel, Young Sheldon. Big Bang ory, the 3 camera sitcom, looksnpretty much like I Love Lucy. re are very few, or faint shadows, everything’snin focus, and the camera angles are familiar. Young Sheldon is single camera, like a movie,nand that allows it to have light and shadow and a gorgeous blurred background. But Freund’s innovation did help a livenaudience — and us — see Friends, and Seinfeld, and Frasier. As he wrote in 193: “To have had the opportunitynto play a part in the success of the I Love Lucy show, which is now the No. 1 rated Televisionnshow in the nation assures me the efts to overcome the handicaps have not been innvain.” Karl Freund was a genius. And sometimes even genius has a sense of humor."
50,0,"You know this scene from  Wizard of Oz. It happens just after Dorothy croons in sepia-tonednKansas, Toto wags his tail,nand the house gets caught in a tornado. She travels from a faded film strip to a Technicolornworld. But there are three things about this scenenyou might get wrong. And each one helps show the real history ofnTechnicolor. se misconceptions explain what then“Technicolor triumph” really was, from the technical aspects that made it work, tonexactly why it took over the movies, to the way in which the technology shaped the looknof the 20th century. Lie #1 - Wizard of Oz is not the first Technicolornmovie. Not even close. You might know that, but a lot of people don’t. Come on Maryland Science , you’renbetter than this. Historian Barbara Flueckiger has an exhaustiventimeline of color in film, from hand-painted filmnto the first movie filmed in “kinemacolor,” A Visit to the Seaside. But Technicolor stood out, and even it hasna history that long predates  Wizard of Oz. Herbert Kalmus, Daniel Frost Comstock, andnW. Burton Wescott founded the company in 191, with the “Tech” referring to MIT, wherenKalmus and Comstock met. It started by merging red and green - intona new image that roughly looked like this. You can see the look in this range of moviesnfrom the late 1920s and early 30s. It could do passably well with skin tones,nbut there’s no blue in these dresses  a reason. Blue came into the mix in 1932, when Technicolornadded the key third strip. y showed off the process in Walt Disney’snFlowers and Trees, a gorgeous animated feature that was a botanist’s nightmare. You know, there are evil trees in Wizard ofnOz, too. “What do you think you’re doing?” Anyway, in order to get Technicolor to work,nit was an insanely difficult process. Technicolor distributednguides like these and we can make a reasonable simulation digitally,nwith a scene like this. So here’s a scene of some Lego people whonare apparently worshipping Lawrence of Arabia? Not sure what’s going on here, but it’snour starting image. A technicolor camera would typically takenthat picture and shoot it through a prism that split the light into red, blue, and greennnegatives  the picture. Those negatives were then flipped into positiven“matrices,” which eventually got soaked with dyes of thencomplementary colors. So the red matrix turned cyan, the green onenmagenta, and the blue one yellow. n the dye was transferred — this wasncalled a “dye transfer process” to create a final gorgeous Technicolor image. So if you’re anything like me, that explanationnmight make you feel like the scarecrow. “Oh I’m a failure because I haven’tngot a brain.” So let’s try it again, but only look atnthat red channel. So keep your eye on the View-Master, the rednin the Rubik’s cube, or maybe the Lego guy’s hat. It is all kind of dark now, because that’snjust the red color in the negative. Now flipped in the matrix, that red is reallynbright, which means that when it’s dyed, it won’t get a lot ofncyan. And that makes sense. Cyan is the complementary color — it’snthe anti-red. So where you want a lot of red, you do notnwant a lot of cyan. That way, when it comes together, you getna ton of magenta and some yellow. You don’t have a lot of cyan, because thencyan cancels out the red. In the earlier days of Technicolor, they alsonhad to amp up the contrast.  company would add a black and white layernunderneath the matrices to serve as something called ""the key."" You can see the results early, in films liken193’s La Cucaracha,  Trail of the Lonesome Pine,nand Robin Hood, all of which came out well bee the Wizard of Oz. It’s easy enough to roughly copy the technologynthat “Technicolored” the Wizard of Oz. RGB split, color bath, mesh, repeat. But the film strip processes are just partnof the story. Lie #2: this scene? It’s not going from a black and white worldnto a color one.  set was actually painted sepia-tone sonthe same Technicolor process could be used  the bright Oz reveal. Today, it’s much easier. I can draw a box with my hand and with a click,nblack and white and color play together. y even had techniques to do stuff likenthis in the Oz days. But the fact that they built a sepia housenshows how Technicolor’s technical limitations shaped all color movies. “This is one of the cameras that was usednto film  Wizard of Oz.” “It weighs  to 00 pounds, and these camerasnwere bigger than ordinary motion picture cameras because they had to run three strips of filmnthrough them at any given time.” So remember — this scene? That had to be done with this beast of a camera. Those three strips didn’t just require morenspace, they needed tons of light. That set had to be blazingly overlit to getnenough light through to these three strips of film.  set was reportedly 100 degrees Fahrenheitnat times. Sound was an issue, too. “It’s so loud when you’re running threenstrips of film through a camera, so they had to build this blimp around it. It’s filled with soundproofing materialnso when you’re making a sound film you don’t get all the sound from the camera throughoutnthe studio there.” Technicolor’s advantages outweighed itsnlimitations. It’s main advantage was the way in whichnit could capture the tone of a scene. Two movies made in the same year could havena different look, not just because of the choices made in front of the camera. Technicolor consultants and directors tweakednthe palette of the film by adjusting the cyan, magenta and yellow dyes.  complicated dye transfer process gavenSingin’ in the Rain some of its magenta-hued skin and deep saturated colors.  film and technology weren’t the onlynthings that gave Technicolor movies their distinctive look. It also shaped the world that they chose tonfilm. Lie #3: This isn’t the real Dorothy. It’s Judy Garland’s body double. She wore specially designed clothes and makeupnto match the sepia world, so Judy Garland could swoop in, in the same shot andna blue dress, to join Technicolor Oz. se movies, and Oz, were shaped around Technicolor’snabilities, from head to toe. “ second page that you see here is thenpart of the script that shows the ruby slippers being unveiled, but what it shows is thatnthey were still silver shoes at this point, but the producers of the film really wantednto show off that Technicolor that they were paying , so they wanted them to be sparklynruby slippers that would look good against the yellow brick road. So they changed it at the middle of productionnto ruby slippers.” Today, the shoes are kept under low lightnto preserve them, but during the shoot they were blasted with light to accommodate thencamera and make those sequins sparkle. se weren’t just on-set decisions — Technicolornwas always pulling strings behind the curtains. Look at the credits  Wizard of Oz, and  Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and AnStar is Born, and so on and so on. You’ll see one name over and over. Natalie Kalmus. Once married to Technicolor cofounder HerbnKalmus, she ruled with an iron fist over Technicolor productions  many of the earlynyears. Kalmus had over 300 film credits where shengave Technicolor advice — and sometimes told directors what to do. This is the IMDB page  a woman born inn1882. In ndocuments like “Color Consciousness,” she extended her reach into art — the essaynincludes aesthetic color theory. “Red: danger, blood, life, heat. Green: Nature, outdoors, freedom, freshness.” Kalmus’s influence was significant, butnit’s as important as a reflection of Technicolor’s power. Technicolor had its own processing facilities,nand its own camera crew that continued Natalie Kalmus’ work after she left the company.  technology and the production processngave Technicolor a significant competitive advantage to alternatives being used. Despite all those alternatives shown on BarbaranFlueckiger’s website, studios stuck with Technicolor  a long time. It had a reliable system andncould be shown in any theatre in splendid color, without requiring special equipment. Technicolor eventually fell to cheaper processesnthrough the 190s, like Eastman Color, that used a single strip.  Godfather, Part II was one of the finalnmajor releases to use the Technicolor we recognize. But old prints remain surprisingly vibrantntoday due to the dye transfer process used. Today, I can snap my fingers and be inn Matrix or in Stranger Things’ Upside Down. Ok. What are all these dust particles? Is this asbestos? Am I covered in asbestos right now? Technicolor was never just a click —nthe look was med by the camera’s strengths and weaknesses, the artistic choices maden color, and the Technicolor company’s infrastructure and supervision. In that key scene from the Wizard of Oz, younmight not have known the trivia about Dorothy’s double, or the sepia doorway, or even thatnit wasn’t Technicolor’s debut. But one thing is easy to understand, intuitively.  movie is all about it. Technicolor wasn’t a switch or a doorway. It was a whole world, just waiting on thenother side. You can nerd out a lot more on Technicolornby checking out Barbara Flueckiger’s website, or Eastman , which was really generousnwith their time and a lot of the images that you saw in this video. I’ve linked both of those below. You can see the director’s commentary nthis video in an additional video that we’ve made where I share some behind-the-scenesninfo and a few of the details that couldn’t quite fit in."
51,0,"Superheroes are mass culture, but comic booksnare niche. Tens of millions of people saw Captain America:nCivil War, but this past May, Marvel only sold 177,000ncopies of Civil War II. But if you took Marvel’s opening creditsnand replaced this with this,neven the people who’d never touched a comic book page..would notice. Everybody knows the “comic book font.” How could there be a universally recognizednfont  something that,  a half century, was written by hand? Is it a font at all? How is that possible? se fonts are made by people called “letterers.” And their work shows how hundreds of letteringnartists can come together into a single recognizable style. And how we, as consumers, then manage to getnit completely wrong. If you go to a comic book store,nyou can see comics that were gloriously lettered by hand,nlike this 196 issue of Thor. (Yes, it was a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby production.) And they worked with Artie Simek. Artie probably gave Thor this epic WHOOM. Letterers place and draw expressive dialoguenbubbles like this one. But in Artie’s day, they also hand wrotenevery word in a dialogue bubble. And a lot of practical conditions shaped thenartistry of the letters. “What I think of as comic book letteringnis 1960s Marvel comics. y were mainly lettered by two guys: ArtienSimek and Sam Rosen. For me, they kind of nailed it.” That’s John Roshell, who founded Comicraft,na comic book font company, with Richard Starkings. y’re letterers and writers, and theynmake fonts like this one and comics like this one.  fonts they design imitate a style thatnmed out of necessity. That style came out of the newspaper worldnand newspaper technology. Early comics like “Little Nemo,” whichncame out in the 1900s, started to develop a style that was readable on cheap paper. You can see it ming in this bubble — it’snall caps, like a comic book font, but it’s somehow...wrong. As time went on, that changed. “Certainly early on, comic strips and comicnbooks were lettered by the artist. As they gained popularity, that’s when thenproduction model started to get split up, basically to meet the demand.  letterer was probably just somebody innthe office who had good handwriting, who could do it fast enough.” But the m’s limitations shaped the stylenthat emerged across the industry. Most letterers used an Ames guide like thisnone to create their lines, which meant each letter hit the same height and, more likely,nhit middle in the middle of the line. se letters became kind of squat becausenthey’re really trying to hit the lines on the top and bottom of the guide. That led to generally rounder Osnand fatter As with lower crosses. Earlier letterers also used a Speedball Nibnpen or a technical pen. se things here: they’re nibs. y determine a letter’s shape, and annartist could use any type they wanted. But a lot of the time, they chose nibs thatngave them a consistent stroke width. Compare this “Loki” to one that showsnup in Times New Roman. Now look at the Times one. It has a skinny base on the L, a very narrownO at the top, and all sorts of other little details where the stroke width varies. Arti Simek’s Loki, however, has a reallynconsistent width to it.  quality of the pages also influenced thenstyle that letterers chose. Here’s that 196 Thor next to Thor fromn2016. Just look at the difference between the pages. Today’s glossy Thor can handle all sortsnof letters, but 196’s couldn’t. Letterers wrote in all caps to compensate. Look at this ad from 196’s Thor.  ink is blotchy and hard to read. All caps helps fix that. And see how the tail on the y and g cesnthat whole line to be longer? All caps helped letterers fit more dialogueninto less space, and keep it clear on lousy paper. Other rules emerged too. Never cross an I, unless it’s by itself,nalways italicize and bold  emphasis — and all of them were made to make comics printednon bad paper easier to read. Consistency also mattered in case anothernletterer jumped in to finish a page or fix up a typo. And all those constraints and choices creatednthe handwritten style we recognize. But today to call it handwriting would benlying. Richard Starkings, who runs Comicraft withnJohn Roshell, was frustrated with the work involved in lettering. This is the Killing Joke, it’s a classic,ncontroversial 80s comic that’s been reprinted in deluxe editions. And Richard Starkings lettered it. Starkingsnhad an experienced letterer’s appreciation of detail. He was frustrated by the work involved innlettering, and an industry that knew that computers were the future, but wasn’t willingnto go there just yet. re’d been earlier attempts to standardizenfonts in comics — most famously a publisher called EC comicsnused a guide to trace every letter, and the result ended up looking kind of mechanical,nlike type. Other publishers played with type too. But Starkings and Roshell led the charge intondigital fonts. “For a long time we had things our way becausenthere were a lot of technophobes in comics. re were a lot of people who didn’t wantnto change. Those people have grown old and there arenpeople in their 20s editing and designing comics now, and they expect you to have everynfont in our library and then some.” Today, companies like Comicraft and competitorsnlike Blambot make fonts that letterers can download and then work with in programs likenAdobe Illustrator. y still make the bubbles and design thentext — they just don’t use ink to do it. But those companies don’t just sell onen“comic book font.” y sell a ton. And that’s because the idea of a “comicnbook font” is a mistake in the first place.  general public only really became awarenof fonts with the rise of personal computers. This chart shows the appearances of the wordn“font” in books from 1960 to 2000. We can see Helvetica, and Arial, and Futuranbecause our computers have trained us to look  them. Some fonts came with our machines or condensednin the document cloud. We notice them. We see these tiny differences. re have always been hundreds of “comicnbook fonts” too, attuned to the idiosyncrasies of the artists who used to letter them. But most people, just like me, haven’t beenntrained to see the nuance in their work. Comics fans and letterers do. “That’s a Todd Klein R. Different letterersnhave their letters of the alphabet that are kind of their signature.” “Dave Gibbons, his D and his G, his G isnalmost a six, it’s a real loop around on itself.” Even Richard Starkings has a quirk — a jaggednhook on the S that always stands out. As technology allows  variety and easenof use, creativity continues to flourish, even if handwriting gets digitized. Comics like Klaus can use color with abandon,nand artsy comics like  Joyners are able to experiment with all kinds of fonts withoutnworrying about cheap paper reducing readability.  “comic book font” is a starting pointn— an idea we keep around because it shows the verve of comics. Within that style is the variety of differentnartists and designers, expressing a key element in every story. And maybe even some of those superhero movienfans will notice it. So in addition to identifying a letterer byntheir handwriting, sometimes you can spot one by the style of their bubbles. John Workman is famous  creating word bubblesnthat jut right into the gutter of a page, and it creates a really distinctive stylenthat’s easy to spot."
52,0,"You might have seen some of these colorizednphotos on the internet. Mark Twain, Amelia Earhart, a young CharlienChaplin. It’s incredible how normal these peoplenlook because they’re no longer in black and white. Like they’re someone you could pass by onnthe street and not someone unreachable or from another time. What I love about these photos is that theynshow people and moments in history that have never been seen in color — except by thosenwho were actually there. I talked to several artists who do this worknto try to figure out what it is about adding color to photos that seems to make years ofnseparation fade away. One of those artists is Jordan Lloyd, andnhe actually does this  a living. He and his small London-based team at Dynamichromenuse modern technology to digitally reconstruct history’s black and white record. When you’re missing the color, you’renkind of looking at the entire composition as a whole. Whereas when you add the color you start lookingnat the photograph in a slightly different way, and you start picking up all these reallyninteresting details that you might not have noticed bee. This change in perspective is why these imagesnfeel like they’ve suddenly “come to life.” Like, when you see workers from over 80 yearsnago wearing blue denim, you instantly see something you can relate to. Colorization makes old photos look more current. But adding color to black and white photosnisn’t new. It’s a practice that is nearly as old asnphotography itself. It dates back to the 1800s when images werencolored by hand or through a process called Photochrom, which added anywhere from sixnto 1 layers of color to a photo negative. But these didn’t exactly end up lookingnsuper realistic, at least not like this,  example. With digital colorization, the differencenis that software like Photoshop, along with a vast number of online resources, has madenit possible  artists to reconstruct images with far more accuracy. y can turn to historical documents to findnthe exact colors that would recreate a moment in time. Sounds simple, right? Yeah, it’s a shitload of work [laughs].  secret to doing the research  the colorizationnis, you now have a wealth of inmation, it’s just knowing where to look. It means digging through diaries and memoirs,ngovernment records, old advertisements, and even consulting historical experts to be surenthat the colors and styles of the time are faithfully represented. A good colorizer has a good network of peoplento call on. We had one guy, he’s like a specialist atnethnographic dress. You know, he was showing me, like, museum-gradensamples, you know, and he lives and breathes this stuff so, like, every single little detail,nlike the color of beads on a Laplander necklace or something, you know, it’s really: “Thisnhas got to be the exact thing.” Take this photo series of Tutankhamun’sntomb, which was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922. Jordan colorized these images based on thenarchaeologist’s detailed hand-written notes. And by cross-referencing his journals withnrestored artifacts on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, he was able to recreate whatnthat day looked like almost a hundred years ago. Research like this allows colorizers to stayntrue to the historical moment. And sometimes a single photograph can revealna thing or two about the past. Like, did you know that until the late 60s,n7UP’s logo was red on black, instead of the green we know today? That’s really important to know if you wantnto colorize this photo from 1938. And if you wanted to recreate this day innParis in 1888, you would need to know that the incomplete Eiffel Tower was painted ancolor called “Venetian red.” All right, so how do they actually do it? Essentially, it’s literally taking a graphicsntablet and, you know, literally coloring within the lines. Okay, obviously it isn’t actually that simple. It all starts with the careful repairing ofnany cracks and scratches the black and white photo picked up through decades of deteriorationnin storage. Once the image has been restored to its originalnstate, dozens and up to hundreds of layers of color are painstakingly added and blendedntogether. Human skin alone can have up to 20 layersnof pinks, yellows, greens, reds, and blues to simulate what a living person is supposednto look like. It can take hours, even days to finish a singlenimage. I think the longest I’ve spent on an imagenis nearly a month. What comes next is pretty interesting, becauseneven after meticulous research, restoration, and blending of colors, there’s somethingnthat every good colorization artist needs to have: an intuitive understanding of hownlight works in the atmosphere. Light affects our perception of color, soneven though research can give you the color inmation, you’ll need to take into accountnhow those colors looked under a specific lighting condition. But how can you tell? You can usually tell what the atmosphericnconditions were based on things like shadows, and triangulation of light location, thingsnlike that. For example, this photo was taken in the latenafternoon. Look at the long shadows the people are castingnon the sidewalk.  sun is low, and at this time of day, oftennreferred to as “the golden hour,” everything is cast in a sort of orange glow, which youncan see in the reflections of this car. Or take a look at this photo of Harry Houdininfrom 1912.  cloudy and hazy sky, the soft, almostninvisible shadows, and Houdini’s windswept hair are all strong indicators that this wasna dreary day at the New York docks, which calls  muted colors and a greenish tint. But weather conditions aren’t the only thingnto consider. Reflected light off of certain materials influencesncolor too. Like the orange glow of molten steel, or lightnbouncing up from a blue carpet,  example. se kinds of details are critical to simulatingnan environment and achieving true photorealism. I should take a second here to mention thatnnot everyone is into the work colorization artists are doing. re’s been some pushback, with criticsnarguing that these photos should be left untouched. re’s a lot of accusations, not just tonme but to pretty much anyone who does it, which is that, you know, we’re vandalizingnart or fucking up history. And the thing about that is that these thingsnare not supposed to be substitutes  original documents. It sits alongside the original. But it’s not a substitute; it’s a supplement. Colorization artists are able to create suchnhigh-quality versions of old images because institutions like the Library of Congressnand the US National Archive have carefully digitized and cataloged thousands of originalndocuments from over a century and a half of photographic history. And since these photos are in the public domain,nthey can be altered in any way. Which means that we get to see a color photonof Abraham Lincoln, blue eyes and all. Beyond the fact that these are really funnto look at, colorization presents a new perspective on history. It offers a more relatable look at huge moments,nlike the construction of the Hoover Dam. And small ones too. You find out all these amazing stories. When you start looking at all the individualnthings. What happened to all these companies? What happened to this person, what happenednhere? And all of a sudden, you no longer see historynas a linear timeline, but rather it’s a tapestry of all these extremely rich moments. It’s really mind-blowing, actually."
53,1,"(gentle ) - [Narrator] This chart shows the yield on the German governments 30-year bonds over the past few months. Youll notice something unusualnhappened in early August.  yield dropped below zero. A yield is the returnninvestors receive on a bond. A negative yield is thenopposite, meaning investors are receiving less moneynthan they originally paid. Negative yields are anrelatively new feature in the worlds bond markets,nbut theyre appearing with increasing frequency. ly, around $16ntrillion worth of bonds currently carry a negative yield. Bonds are one of the safestninvestments on the market. yre staples of manyninvestment portfolios, from pension funds to retirement accounts. Investors like them becausenof their reliable returns. So how did some bond yields go negative? And why would investorsnkeep putting their money in assets with negative returns? To understand negative yields, you need to understand how bonds work. Bonds are a m of debt that governments and companies issue nvarious lengths of time. A bonds lifespan cannrange from a few weeks to a few decades. Bond issuers makenregular interest payments to bond holders over the assets lifespan. This is known as the coupon rate. But bonds are often bought andnsold on the secondary market. ir prices fluctuate, which affects what an investor can expect to earn.  yield is a calculationnof how much an investor can expect to make fromnholding onto a bond bought at a particular price  anparticular length of time.  yield of a bond isninversely related to its price. High demand in the bondnmarket drives up prices and drives down yields. This is largely why yields are negative. Right now, the bond market is experiencing unusually high demand. re are a few reasons  this.  first is that investors have grown increasingly concernednabout the lack of growth in the global economy. Amid low inflation, political uncertainty, and trade disputes, investorsnare putting more money into safer assets, like bonds.  second is that severalncentral banks around the world have set their interest rates below zero. Central banks are banksn commercial banks. So when they set negativeninterest rates, commercial banks must pay them  the privilegenof holding their money. This incentivizes commercial banks to lower the interestnrates they charge to. So far, commercial banksnhave been reluctant to pass that negativenrate to average consumers, but some have passed onnthe cost to companies and large institutional investors. Negative rates give investorsnan incentive to buy bonds rather than park their money at a bank. This drives up demand. se factors havenpushed bond prices higher and driven down yields, sonmuch so that they are now in negative territory and,nin some cases, even below the negative rates set by central banks. So why would investorsncontinue to buy bonds with negative yields? Well, if demand continuesnto rise, buying now means potentially selling bondsnlater at a higher price. This can help offsetnlosses in the short term, but the long-term implicationsnof negative yields could mean lower returns on pensionsnand retirement accounts, meaning workers might havento save more and work longer. Negative bond yields, andnnegative interest rates in general, are viewednas a short-term remedy to get economies moving. But with the footprint ofnnegative rates getting deeper and wider, investors worrynthat they may be less of a temporary fix, andnmore of a permanent fixture in the market. (gentle )"
54,1,"(pleasant orchestral ) - [Narrator] When theneconomy screeched to a halt in mid-March, businessesnshut down almost overnight, and quickly, millions ofnworkers became unemployed. Within weeks, the government moved to provide trillions ofndollars of stimulus relief to workers and businessesnthroughout the economy. - $1200 checks to anyonenwho makes less than $7,000. - This is another $600na week  four months. - [Reporter] Congress approving another $8 billion  loans. - [Narrator] So where doesnall this money come from? Is it taxpayer funds? Is the government printingna bunch of new cash? As you might expect,ntheres a lot more to know. (pleasant orchestral ) Congress can authorize taxesnto pay  new spending, but thats not where thenstimulus money is coming from. That money is beingnraised through borrowing.  government expects tonborrow a record $. trillion  the fiscal yearnthat ends in September. Thats more than threentimes the $1.28 trillion it borrowed the year prior. That borrowed money is being used to subsidize small business payrolls, send checks to households, and offer taxpayers a temporary holiday on making tax payments.  Treasury Department isnin charge of the borrowing.  agency borrows by sellingntreasury bills or bonds to the three main groups of savers.  public sector, like othernparts of the government, the private sector, whichnincludes companies or individuals like you and me, and eign entities. se bills are like IOUs,nsomeone agrees to buy them, and the government agrees to pay them back with a little bit of interest. In the meantime, the government can use thatnborrowed money  stimulus to support privatenindividuals and companies, or state and local governments. - This year, the federalngovernment will get most of its borrowingnfrom the private sector, and the reason  that isnbecause private borrowers who would normally be competingnwith the federal government  private savings, havenbasically disappeared. - [Narrator] That stimulus moneyncan make the economy larger than it otherwise would have been. It encourages employersnto keep people employed, and it encourages individuals to spend. Heres a hypothetical example. Lets say Congress authorizes $1 billion in stimulus spending.  Treasury would borrow one billion by selling treasury bills. It would then use that borrowed money on the stimulus programs, with the hopes of keepingnthe economy churning, but it doesnt end there. If the economy keeps moving, households and businessesncan keep earning income, and some of that income can be saved, and in the future, theyncan use those savings to invest in more treasury bills, supplying the governmentnwith more money to spend. -  amount of saving in theneconomy is not a fixed amount. Federal stimulus can actuallynresult in more people working, more firms having profits, higher incomes than would have been the case if there hadnt been anynfederal stimulus at all. This is known as Keynesian stimulus name  the Britishneconomist John Maynard Keynes who first came up with thenconcept back in the 1930s.  government is not like anfamily that has a fixed amount and cant borrow more than it can pay back because itll go bankrupt. Government can in effect borrow enough to actually make the economy bigger. - [Narrator] Now on topnof the three main sources of borrowing, theres another source too, the Federal Reserve.  central bank isnlike the other sources, but with a key difference.  Fed can raise funds to buy treasuries by simply printing money. - So when we say thenFed is printing money, we dont literally mean itsnfiring up the printing presses and creating paper money. Instead, what we mean is thenFed basically clicks a button and credit the Treasurysnaccount with this money. Its electronic money,nits not paper money. - [Narrator] In effect,nthe Treasury sells a bond and in return gets brand new money. Right now, the Fed isnramping up its lending. Assets on the central banks balance sheet topped $6.7 trillion duringnthe first week of May 2020. That gives the Treasurynmore money to spend on stimulating the economynand other programs. Critics of the stimulus,nsay the government competing with other borrowers  savings will push up interest rates, making it harder  private companies and individuals to borrow and invest. y also say that if the Fed prints money to finance the borrowing, that will lead to inflationnand economic turmoil, like whats seen in Venezuela and the trillion dollarnnotes seen in Zimbabwe, - Its only a problem ifnthey print and they print and they print and thenthose dollars gets spent and spent and spent again, until all that spending far exceeds the supply of goods andnservices in our economy, thats when you get high inflation. How will we know thats happening? Well, we probably see long termninterest rates start to rise as investors get ready nthe approach of inflation. n wed start to seenactual inflation rise, but were not seeing that now.

55,1,"(pleasant mallet percussion ) - [Alexander]  coronavirusnhas upended the world of higher education. In March, students werenabruptly sent home, classes were moved online. Now, as campuses acrossnthe country sit empty, administrators are scrambling to prepare  what comes next. - In many ways, the attacknthat COVID represents to higher education is anreally straightward assault on the bottom line. -  financial challenges are severe. I mean, I wont kid you,ntheyre profoundly challenging. - re will be more bankruptcies,nmore business failures, more need to federal and state bailouts. - [Alexander]  pandemicnhas thrown the budgets of public and privatencolleges into turmoil. Since the lockdowns went into effect, they have seen their revenuesndrop and their expenses climb. - And I think, yeah, morenthan belt-tightening, this may be something likenreconstructive surgery if not actually thoracic surgery. - [Alexander] With allneducation now virtual, e-learning is having a moment. When students were sent home mid-semester, American higher ed begannwhat was essentially a nationwide experiment. In the space of three weeks, all learning was moved fromnthe classroom to the internet. This has accelerated thentrend towards online education and raised more fundamental questions about the value of a college degree. - College studentsnsuing Drexel University, the University of Miami and others saying online learning is no replacement  a bricks and mortarnon-campus experience. - What will be thenlasting legacy of COVID-19  higher education? Could this virus lead to a wave of college and university closures? Will the classroom wenonce knew gradually return or could COVID permanentlyntransm how we learn? - Hello. - Hey, Bryan. To help answer these questions, I spoke to Bryan Alexander,na higher education futurist. As his title suggest,nAlexander spends a lot of time contemplating what might happen in the higher education space. In a passage included in his 2020 book, Alexander suggested the possibility of a global pandemicntransming the industry. - I wrote the chapter in 2018, 2019, and Im afraid it is chillingly prescient. - [Alexander] But how do younimagine a post-COVID future when so little is knownnabout COVID itself? With so much uncertaintynsurrounding the pandemic, Alexander believes itsnimpossible to divine any one outcome. Instead he sees three potential paths  the future of higher education. - One is that we could be in the middle of a short plague, that is, something whichnburns out relatively quickly, that perhaps a month from now, we are very, very farndown the downhill side and that, come August and September, well be in good shape andncolleges and universities can open their physical doors to welcome face-to-face students again. A second possibility is that the pandemic will extend through December into 2021. In that case, then we have tonthink about higher education being virtual throughoutnthe entire fall semester. - [Alexander] Recently, the Calinia State University system announced that it would be canceling most in-person classes in the fall and will instead hold them online. This is significant becausenthe Cal State system is the largest four-yearnuniversity system in the country.  system is also one of thenmost diverse in the country, with 1/3 of undergraduatesnthe first in their families to attend college. One of those is Ana Ruth Bertolazzi, a senior at San FrancisconState University. - As a single parent, mynson, hes a seventh-grader, soon now close to be eighth-grader, it was a challenge. - [Alexander] Like many students, one challenge Ana hasnfaced are class disruptions due to a slow internet connection. - re are momentsnwhen, if I ask a question to my Zoom class professor, either my voice is not evennprojecting or it stops. - [Alexander] Students likenAna would also be impacted by Alexanders third ecast. - A third possibility is that, instead of having a simplenpandemic, short or long, that well have something more complicated with multiple waves. For academia, I dub this the toggle term. This is when a campus willnhave to switch back and th between face-to-face instruction and wholly online instruction. - [Alexander] Each of thesenscenarios would be costly. Even in the best ecast,nwhere the pandemic is shorter and campuses reopen in thenfall, theres no guarantee that all students and faculty will return. That means smaller classesnand less revenue  schools. If the fall semester is online, Alexander expects the financialnhit to be even more severe as more students demand tuition breaks. - We have about ,00ncolleges and universities in the U.S. all told, andnI could see easily 10% staring into the abyssnthis time next year. What worries me are, first of all, private colleges and universities that, you know, thereenlack any state support, but that are not the most highly ranked, the lower ranked andnthe medium ranked ones. - [Alexander] DominicannUniversity is a small, private liberal arts college located in San Rafael, Calinia. - We know were gonnanhave some financial hits. We know well have to makensome adjustments to get there, but we know where were headed, and were really reasonablynwell-positioned to manage this.  place where Dominicannis not as well-positioned, and its true of many,nmany small colleges, is we dont have deep pockets. You know, we have anreally small endowment. - [Alexander] But small private schools arent the only ones at risk. Some state universitiesnare in trouble as well. - Im also concerned aboutnpublic university systems that are facing similar problems. For example, you think about Pennsylvania. - [Alexander] One of thenpublic systems at risk is Pennsylvanias StatenSystem of Higher Education, which is made up of 1 state-owned colleges and universities. -  challenges of higher education, public higher education generally, theyre pretty acutely concentrated here. Obviously, a historic patternnof declining public investment has ced universitiesnto increase tuition and actually net average price overall, so those challenges sort of have combined in our system to producenthe 20% enrollment decrease since 2010, between 2010 and 2019, and obviously, as our enrollments go down, were in an enrollment-driven industry, and as a consequence, ournrevenues have declined as well. - [Alexander] If there isnone consensus in higher ed, its that online education is here to stay and that it will only grow in importance. One company that is uniquely positioned to understand this trend is Chegg. Chegg provides online services  about 60% of Americanncollege students. - When I went to collegenmany, many years ago, my Intro to Business coursesnwere 300-person lectures in a giant auditorium. Not only are those potentiallyndangerous right now, but the reality is, those lendnthemselves very, very well to online learning. - [Alexander] Last semester,nschools were ced online out of necessity, but the reality is,  many students, necessitynmay keep them there. - We have to imaginenthat many, many families are seeing their savings andninvestments put into chaos, those who have those, some of them are being hit economically by unemployment or underemployment. Some of them additionallynare being hit by disease. - Like a lot of things right now, what youre seeing is an acceleration. res already been anmovement of lots of people questioning the ROI of goingnin  a four-year degree that, all-in, may cost 20 or $300,000  people, while theyre also not working and getting a job that entire time. - [Alexander] More studentsnonline means less revenue  schools, but BryannAlexander is optimistic that the industry will get creative and adapt to students needs. - Well,  looking at the fall, and if either of mynscenarios come to pass, either the toggle term or the long plague and faculty and staff have to prepare  a full semester online, now we have months, not weeks, we have months to plan, prepare, shape, and hone the experience.
