Daughter of Australia's most infamous gangster | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,1949001,"11,054","1,656","Imagine having a professional hitman as a babysitter. Or being showered in tens of thousands of dollars in cash at your christening. For Dhakota Williams, the unbelievable was her normal. Exclusively on 60 MINUTES, she reveals the highs and lows of an extraordinary childhood unlike any other Australian teenage girl. Of course, her notoriety was not of her own making. It came from being the only child of Carl Williams, who for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s was Australia's most infamous gangster. As Dhakota tells Liam Bartlett though, she knew him as a gentle, doting father, not the baby-faced thug who trafficked drugs and murdered anyone who got in his way. Dhakota was born in the middle of Australia's bloodiest gangland war, which was later dramatised in the acclaimed Underbelly series. Growing up, she benefited from the glitzy excesses of her mobster father's ill-gotten gains, but at the age of nine she also confronted the brutal reality that crime never pays when her father was bashed to death in prison. Now 17, this young woman is trying to step away from the sins of her father. But to do that, she first must discover the truth about why he was killed (2018).WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

A Journey Through Mongolia (Full Length Documentary),Travel & Events,1086354,"7,578",463,"Mongolia! A Journey through Mongolia is a travel documentary from our one month trip through the great expanses of the Mongolian plains. We started the trip with a few days in Ulaanbaatar to experience the sprawling metropolis. We also had a chance to go to Hustai National Park not far from UB to see the last remaining wild horse, the Takhi. Then we went on a ten day adventure to go live with the Tsaatan Reindeer Herder tribe in the very north on the border of Siberia. This was an incredible experience and it was very demanding with multiple days on horseback after a long strenuous multi-day 4WD trip. After a short recovery we went to the eastern part of the country to the Bayan-Ölgii Province to attend the Golden Eagle Festival. This festival has really been the focus of the Mongolian travel in recent time, very much because of Aishol-pan the ""Eagle Huntress"". We had a chance to meet this incredible girl who is certainly an inspiration to women across the world. After the festival we went and lived with an eagle hunter family deep in the Altai Mountain Range. We hope you will enjoy this full length travel documentary and please subscribe to our channel for more adventures around the world.

Antarctica at one time was not covered with ice, and could have been home to ancient humans. As we develop new methods for uncovering the ice, we are beginning to see the possibilities that lay below. Mainstream ideology puts forward the ""Out of Africa"" theory, which tracks humans originating in Africa and spreading out by land across the world. However, genetic research is finding evidence that makes our story far more complex. One of these findings is the discovery of the Denisovan people of Siberia, which reveals an entirely new, intelligent human subspecies (first discovered in 2008). It is findings like this, that cause us to have to rewrite human history.

Tesla held over 300 patents and is responsible for inventing the laser, x-ray, radio, Tesla coil, Tesla turbine, neon signs, induction motor, remote control and many more. Tesla was a brilliant mind, but did not focus his energy on monetizing his inventions and had difficulty socializing. He died alone in a small hotel in New York.

Enemy of Enemies: The Rise of ISIL (P1) | Featured Documentary,News & Politics,478179,"1,981",179,"ISIL has been truly devastating to those it comes in contact with and bloody to those under its control. Its sudden rise and expansion in 2014 has perplexed many. It has humiliated its enemies, including those in Damascus, Baghdad, Tehran and Washington. Armed with extensive weaponry, boasting an international fighting force and adept in the art of digital media propaganda, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has become the de facto authority across an area the size of the United Kingdom. This two-part series peels back the rhetoric to examine how a volunteer organization managed to rise up from the ashes of post-invasion Iraq and defeat standing armies many times its size and capacity. How did it begin? How did it grow so astonishingly quickly? And how is it being used by global and regional powers to change the geopolitical map of the Middle East? With critical testimony from informed insiders and experts from across three continents, as well as original footage from Syria and Iraq, this series mixes documentary and discussion to unravel the interweaving nexus of events and alliances, at once aligned and conflicting, that have given rise to the world’s most notorious, and powerful, insurgent group.",PT47M30S,10/18/15,10/18/15,133131,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,xsHrULpYeFk

Secretly filmed interviews describe how men on mopeds carried millions in cash to the Maldives’ political elite. President Abdulla Yameen and his former deputy, Ahmed Adeeb, are accused of receiving cash in bags filled with up to $1m, so much that it was “difficult to carry,” according to one of the men who delivered it.

Jamal Khashoggi: The Silencing of a Journalist | Al Jazeera World,Film & Animation,159113,"1,062",99,"On October 2, 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist working in the US for the Washington Post, entered his country's consulate in Istanbul to process paperwork - and was never seen again.On the same day, a 15-man Saudi hit squad had allegedly flown to Istanbul. All the evidence points to Khashoggi's murder, suggesting that his body was first dismembered and then disposed of.The killing of the well-known journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has resonated around the world, both as an attack on media freedom and as a shocking insight into the workings of a secretive and repressive regime.The horrific story has been well documented in the media but there are still pieces missing and serious questions remaining unanswered: What happened to the body? Why did two weeks pass before Turkish investigators were allowed into the consulate to examine forensic evidence? And who was ultimately responsible for the killing?Al Jazeera Arabic's Tamer Almisshal goes to Istanbul to try and find answers. He has pieced together the chronology of events - and examined the theories as to what may have happened to Khashoggi's body.In mid-March, Saudi Arabia announced it had started court proceedings against those it believes were involved. The Kingdom still refuses to agree to a UN-led investigation, and despite the volume of powerful evidence, we still don't know whether those ultimately responsible for Khashoggi's death will ever be openly held to account.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #JamalKhashoggi #SaudiArabia",PT48M22S,3/27/19,3/27/19,133111,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,snu-0lGABUI

🇹🇳 Who Killed Tunisian Drone Expert Mohammed Al-Zawari? | Al Jazeera World,News & Politics,46727,271,34,"Filmmaker: Ashraf MashharawiOn December 15, 2016, a 49-year-old Tunisian man was shot dead outside his home in Sfax, 270 kilometres south-east of Tunis.Mohammed al-Zawari had been known locally as an aviation engineer interested in drone technology, but in fact, he had led a double life, leading a drone development project for the military wing of Hamas, the Qassam Brigades.According to Al Jazeera Arabic's investigation by Tamer Almisshal, several parties were involved in a coordinated plot against al-Zawari, who up until his death was called 'Mourad' by many of those who knew him, including his wife.Almisshal believes it has all the hallmarks of an extra-judicial killing by Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, but these cases are notoriously difficult to prove and must for the moment remain speculation.Al-Zawari first left Tunisia in 1991 as a dissident against the regime of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He managed to travel using a fake passport and worked in a military manufacturing installation in Sudan. He only returned home after the 2011 revolution that forced Ben Ali out of the country.Shortly after his death, Hamas announced that the drone expert had worked for the Qassam Brigades for a decade. They credited him with developing the Ababeel drones used against Israel in Gaza in the summer of 2014.""By the 2008 Israeli aggression against Gaza, the team had manufactured 30 drones in an Iranian military factory,"" according to a Qassam Brigades member going by the name of 'Abu Mohamed'. Another Brigades member, Abu Mujahid, says drones were important to them because ""we can conduct it with precision against military targets and avoid civilians.""As well as building drones, al-Zawari did innovative research into remote-controlled submarines, as potential combat devices for the Qassam Brigades.Israeli journalist Moav Vardi went to Tunisia to investigate the Zawari case. ""It's not a criminal assassination by a gang or a neighbour's quarrel"" he says. ""From what it seems, Israel has the interest and the ability to carry out such an operation.""Almisshal reveals that the assassination took months to plan and involved several people in different teams. The two men who carried out the killing allegedly had Bosnian and Croatian passports. Another went by the name of Chris Smith who'd contacted Sfax University where al-Zawari was doing postgraduate research.In another team was a Tunisian journalist tasked with surveilling Zawari. How the assassins arrived in and left the country is a confidential part of the Tunisian investigation, as the police case is still ongoing.There have been other alleged Mossad assassinations outside Israeli territory. For instance, Israel admitted responsibility for the 1988 killing of a senior Palestinian commander Abu Jihad, whose real name was Khalil al-Wazir, at his home in Tunis, Tunisia. Wazir was a friend and deputy to then Palestinian chief Yasser Arafat, who headed the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).Mossad is also alleged to have been behind the 2010 murder of Mahmud al-Mabhuh in a Dubai hotel. He was the Hamas logistics commander for the Qassam Brigades; and of the Black September founder Ali Hassan Salameh, or 'The Red Prince"", using a car loaded with heavy explosives in Beirut in 1979. In March 2018, two men were arrested in connection with Zawari's murder, Croatian Alen Camdzic and Bosnian Elvir Sarac. In May, Croatia's highest court blocked Camdzic's extradition to Tunisia and Sarac was released after a Bosnian court refused to hand him over to Tunisia, saying there was no extradition deal between the countries.Until the Tunisian authorities manage to extradite the two men, the case of the murder of Mohamed al-Zawari cannot begin to be resolved - whoever was behind it.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #TunisianDrone #AlJazeeraWorld",PT46M16S,12/12/18,12/12/18,133144,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,b-CYyLphmz0

🇾🇪 Yemen: Pulling the Strings | Al Jazeera World,Entertainment,224244,649,159,"The current crisis in Yemen is a very complex one.This film focuses on one aspect of it: how the Houthis were able to move south from their northern base and take the capital, Sanaa, quite so easily, and whether former President Ali Abdullah Saleh may have played a role in this move.Founded in the early 1990s by Hussein Badr Eddin al-Houthi, the Houthis grew into a strong military force.As Zaidi Shia, they were convinced of their right to participate in the national government and fought a series of six wars against the Saleh regime between 2004 and 2010. Here, we look at the rise of the Houthis and their move south from their northern stronghold of Saada Province, and explore the possibility that there was more to former President Saleh's role in this than was apparent at the time.Some who had been closely associated with Saleh and served in the army during battles against the Houthis testify here about what they saw as double dealing.Fahad al-Sharafi was a leading member of Saleh's General People's Congress Party during the third Houthi war.""I was part of the presidential committee when the president ordered the First Armoured Division and the 17th Infantry to withdraw. These honourable men had to leave behind the sacrifices they'd made,"" he says. ""They even had to leave the bodies of their comrades without covering or burying them.""Abdullah al-Hadhari is a Brigadier-General in the Yemeni Army and has a PhD in international law. He took part in the six wars against the Houthis and was surprised at some of the orders coming out of Sanaa.""I think the ceasefire was the biggest crime,"" he says. ""Tribes supporting us were being annihilated and killed, but the government turned a blind eye on the pretext of the ceasefire.""  ""All these tribes were served up to the Houthis on a golden platter,"" Sharafi says. ""Many tribes fought alongside the government and achieved victory, but the government gave them up during the truce.""Al-Sharafi also spotted what he felt was double-dealing between Saleh and the businessman, politician and arms dealer, Fares Manaa, while he was negotiating peace deals with the Houthis.""The Houthis had four trucks loaded with weapons that were used against the people of Ghamar while Fares was part of a mediation committee,"" Sharafi says. ""He was on a mediation committee and supplied weapons to the Houthis at the same time.""In February 2011, Yemenis protested against President Saleh and his government on the streets of Sanaa. Houthis took part in the Youth Revolution which led to Saleh handing over power to Vice President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. But some Yemenis thought that their commitment to their own cause was greater than to the general good. The revolution seemed also to galvanise the Houthis and give them both the opportunity and encouragement they needed to initiate their move south. They duly made their gradual way towards the capital, attacking the cities and villages in their path.At the same time, Saleh began plotting how to take revenge on those who had opposed him during the revolution, including leading military figures like Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar and Hamid al-Qushaibi. It's possible that Saleh manipulated the Houthis to serve his interests in a proxy war against his own political enemies, including President Hadi.As the Houthi rebellion gained momentum in 2014, forces in the Yemeni Army and Republican Guard who had remained loyal to Saleh, may have colluded with the Houthis to help pave their way to the capital. When they arrived there, they were able to take the city with unusual ease, explained by interviewees in the film, by the lack of resistance by army groups involved in this double dealing.""I believe the Minister of Defence betrayed Yemen, the nation and his military honour. He betrayed the Arab nation because he handed over Sanaa to the Houthis instead of defending it as a national and constitutional duty,"" Hadhari laments.Peace talks are planned in Kuwait in the coming days, involving the three main players: the internationally-recognised government of President Hadi with the Sunni tribes, the Houthis and Saleh's General People's Congress Party.The film concludes that if factional in-fighting and Machiavellian plans had not been hatched by Saleh, the Houthis and all the other parties involved, Yemen might have been spared such a prolonged and damaging civil conflict.More from Al Jazeera World on:YouTube - http://aje.io/aljazeeraworldYTFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorldTwitter - https://twitter.com/AlJazeera_WorldVisit our website - http://www.aljazeera.com/aljazeeraworldSubscribe to AJE on YouTube - http://aje.io/YTsubscribe",PT46M59S,4/21/16,4/21/16,133121,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,PXdnLA1-ZNs

Iran 1979: Anatomy of a Revolution l Featured Documentary,News & Politics,139568,"1,248",87,"Editor's note: This film was first broadcast in 2009.In 1979, after decades of royal rule, millions of Iranians took to the streets in a popular movement against a regime that was seen as brutal, corrupt and illegitimate.Protesters from all social classes demanded the removal of Mohamed Reza Shah Pahlavi, the country's monarch since 1941. The Shah had long been criticised for his ties to Western countries, particularly Britain and the United States, as well as crackdowns by internal security forces on dissenting voices.While the country enjoyed periods of economic prosperity, citizens began protesting against the government after an economic collapse in 1977, which caused high unemployment and rising inflation.During his rule, Pahlavi had few more staunch critics than Grand Ayatollah Khomeini.The cleric condemned the Shah's ""White Revolution"", an ambitious modernisation programme that redistributed land and pushed for social reforms in the 1960s - criticising that it undermined Iran's Shia traditions and served foreign interests.The Shah arrested Khomeini in 1963 and forced him into exile a year later. But the cleric would continue to bear influence from afar, calling for an end to the monarchy and the establishment of an Islamic republic.Khomeini's taped speeches won a growing audience among Iranians in the 1970s, many of whom were dissatisfied with the government. The so-called ""cassette revolution"" was under way.By the end of 1978, protests against the Shah had turned into a revolution and on January 16, 1979, the Shah fled the country - ending more than 2,000 years of Persian monarchy.On February 1, Khomeini returned to Iran to crowds of supporters and soon after appointed an interim prime minister.

Yemen: The North-South Divide | Al Jazeera World,Entertainment,55134,398,31,"The current crisis in Yemen, a country crippled by war, took a dramatic turn on December 4 with the assassination of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh by Houthi rebels. But the political and sectarian divisions that dominate Yemen today - and which ultimately led to Saleh's death - go back hundreds of years.When Islam came to Yemen, the Zaidis, a Shia Islamic sect, became dominant in the north, and its imams were in full control there by the 9th century. The Shia presence would remain in the north for the next thousand years.After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the northern kingdom of Yemen was ruled by a Shia imam while the south of Yemen remained divided, run by different local sultanates - until the British eventually established their own southern state, the Federation of South Arabia.North Yemen became a republic in 1962 but it was not until 1967 that the British colonial rule ended in the south and The People's Republic of South Yemen was formed, with Qahtan al-Shaabi as its president.Independence did not stop the southern infighting. The National Liberation Front took power in 1969 and formed a Marxist republic, leaning heavily on support from the Soviet Union. The push-pull between north and south also continued.Some analysts now see this as tension part of the slow process towards the eventual unification of the two halves of Yemen.""The conflict between the north and south has always been about Yemen's unity, the 1972 and 1979 wars,"" explains journalist and historian Abd al-Bari Taher.

"Two Weddings, Somali Style | Al Jazeera World",News & Politics,9155,170,6,"When it comes to weddings, Somalia has many approaches. Some couples stick with tradition while others go for more modern marriage ceremonies.This film tells the story of two weddings, one in a small desert village and the other in a busy city, while highlighting everyday life in different parts of the country. It also contrasts traditional ways of life with modern ideas that come from younger Somalis and social media.In the remote rural village of Toon, herder Jamalli Muhammad Ahmed can only marry a local woman called  Hoda after first getting permission from her family. In a tradition going back generations, they all gather in the shade of a large tree to decide whether they are a suitable match. Only then can Jamalli and Hoda start planning their lives together.Abdullatif Deeq Omar in Hargeisa city, however, first met his future wife Najma on Facebook. They eloped but eventually returned to their families who accepted their marriage plans.Both weddings have the same pressures: buying outfits, inviting guests, finding a venue and arranging feasts - but each tells a unique story of family, community and tradition.In Somali culture, many people also believe that getting married in the run-up to Ramadan ensures additional blessings on the couple, making the happy occasion even more special.More from Al Jazeera World on:YouTube - http://aje.io/aljazeeraworldYTFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorldTwitter - https://twitter.com/AlJazeera_WorldVisit our website - http://www.aljazeera.com/aljazeeraworldSubscribe to AJE on YouTube - http://aje.io/YTsubscribe",PT44M40S,5/6/20,5/6/20,131213,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,mbNctEUO294

Somalia: The Forgotten Story | Al Jazeera World,Entertainment,807860,"4,768",387,"Somalia's modern history is a tale of independence, prosperity and democracy in the 1960s, military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s - followed by a desperate decline into civil war and chaos almost ever since.The effect of the war has been to scatter the Somali people in their millions to refugee camps and  neighbouring countries - and in their hundreds of thousands to the UK, Canada and the United States.Somalia gained independence from Britain and Italy in 1960. It held free and fair elections and was ruled democratically from 1960 to 1969.Once labelled the ""Switzerland of Africa"", Somalia enjoyed almost a decade of democracy. The first elected president of Somalia, uniting the former British and Italian territories, was Adam Abdullah Osman who reigned for seven years. He was succeeded, freely and peacefully, by Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke. Sharmarke, however, was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards in 1969. Speaker of the Somali Parliament Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein took over, but his brief, six-day tenure was cut short by a military coup led by General Siad Barre, ending Somalia's period of democratic government.Whatever its faults - and there were many - Barre's 22-year rule effectively created modern Somalia, building one of Africa's strongest armies and massively improving the literacy of the population.Yet Barre, who gained the support of the US and the Soviet Union, the superpowers of the day, also dissolved parliament, suspended the constitution, banned political parties, arrested politicians and curbed press freedom.""From then, there was a downward trend. In everything. A disintegration. And every time things were going down, the military regime was becoming more brutal and more dictatorial,"" says Jama Mohamed Ghalib, a former Somali government minister. But when Barre launched the Ogaden war in 1977 to take the Somali majority region from Ethiopia, it provoked serious international opposition, including that of the Soviet Union which had once supported Barre but now sided with Ethiopia. The Somali army was forced to withdraw.But the other long-lasting outcome was civil war, with myriad competing factions and frequent intervention by foreign powers and neighbouring countries. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union split into several factions, one of which was Al Shabab. The radical group still controls large parts of the south of the country today.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera- Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeera #SomalianHistory #AlJazeeraWorld",PT46M12S,11/17/16,11/17/16,133113,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,#NAME?

The Biggest Lies Told in History,Entertainment,4587121,"18,276","7,972","From legends about George Washington to historical monuments, here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv10. Columbus Discovered America9. Paul Revere8. 13 Colonies7. Washington Cherry Tree6. The Crossing of the Delaware5. Van Gogh Cut off EarWhile in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don’t mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn’t want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 4. Sphinx NoseHow did the Sphinx lose it’s nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt’s antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it’s still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400’s say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa’im al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 3. Vikings Horned HelmetsArchaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800’s when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies2. StonehengeOne of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they’ve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don’t tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it’s highly doubtful that they’ve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,”Nearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.” This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it’s being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 1. First ThanksgivingSorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there’s absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn’t be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won’t get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don’t let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",PT8M19S,5/2/17,5/2/17,31213,American Eye,/channel/UC8cP3F7DseB_k-D1Afmstzw,UC8cP3F7DseB_k-D1Afmstzw,20,iloQeu-Yg7U

Narrated by Richard Dimbleby.The singers at the Coronation were drawn from the choirs of Westminster Abbey, St Paul’s Cathedral, the Chapel Royal and St George’s Chapel, Windsor, supplemented by 12 boy trebles chosen from various British cathedral choirs. In addition, the Royal School of Church Music conducted auditions to find twenty boy trebles from parish church choirs to represent the various regions of the United Kingdom; these choristers spent the month before the service training at Addington Palace. The final complement of singers numbered 182 boy trebles, 37 altos, 62 tenors and 67 basses.

He discovers that there might be parallel universes in which different versions of us exist and finds out that empty space is not empty at all, but seething with activity.The world we think we know - the solid, reassuring world of our senses - turns out to be a tiny sliver of an infinitely weirder and more wonderful universe than we had ever conceived in our wildest fantasies.The story of the discovery that everything is made from atoms, one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs in history, and the brilliant minds behind it.For more awe inspiring documentaries, subscribe to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZSE...Welcome to ReelTruth.Science the home of inspiring documentaries from the scientific and medical world.

Just 50,000-100,000 years ago, Earth was home to three or four separate human species, including our most famous cousins: the Neanderthals. New research has shown that Neanderthals were not the brutish, unintelligent cavemen that cartoons make them out to be. They were creative, smart, social, and perhaps even had complex language. So why did they go extinct as soon as Homo sapiens moved into their territory? Does any trace of them live on today?

I’m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I’m a physicist.Some people ask me the question, “What has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?”  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.  When I was eight, a great scientist had just died.  I still remember my elementary school teacher coming into the...To read the full transcript and for more info, please visit https://bigthink.com/videos/universe-...",PT42M14S,8/15/12,8/15/12,212232,Big Think,/channel/UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg,UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg,19,0NbBjNiw4tk

Did They Find a Living Megalodon In the Mariana Trench?,Howto & Style,26404973,"274,650","30,621","Сould Megalodon sharks still be alive in the deepest parts of the ocean? Science tells us that Megalodon sharks are extinct. Given that it was a massive shark with noticeable feeding habits, we guess that if Megalodon sharks were still roaming the oceans, they would probably have been spotted by someone by now. But perhaps not if they lived in the deepest place on Earth: the Mariana Trench.TIMESTAMPS:What the name Megalodon means 1:49Megalodon’s size 3:26The deepest spot on Earth 4:13Could Megalodon live in the Mariana Trench 5:00How many people reached Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench 6:39#megalodon #marianatrench #megMusic: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/... SUMMARY:- The Megalodon shark roamed the oceans as early as 23 million years ago, and we have their fossils to prove their existence. When people first encountered Megalodon teeth, they believed them to be rocks that had made their way to Earth from the moon.- Megalodon was the biggest shark to terrorize the ocean, and it is thought to have gone extinct 2.6 million years ago. The name Megalodon means “big tooth.” Most of the recovered Megalodon fossil teeth have been 4” to 5”. But there are a few enormous teeth that are over 7”.- The Mariana Trench is 6.83 miles deep and measures more than 1,500 miles long and 43 miles wide. To put the depth into perspective, if you were to put Mount Everest into the Mariana Trench, the top would still be sticking out. To put the length into perspective, in 1,500 miles you could fit all the states between Florida and Massachusetts. 1,500 miles is also the distance between Madrid, in Spain, and Copenhagen, in Denmark.- To survive in the Mariana Trench, Megalodon would have had to adapt to the living conditions and evolve. It would also have to switch its diet from whales, dolphins, sea lions, and sea cows to whatever organisms reside in the Mariana Trench and hope that it could find and eat its usual 2,500 lb of food per day.- According to the United Nations, there are 7.6 billion people in the world today, and only 3 of them have made it to the deepest point on Earth. The reality is that with so little research, it is impossible to know what lies in the depths of the Mariana Trench.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",PT8M29S,8/26/18,8/26/18,212342,BRIGHT SIDE,/channel/UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,UC4rlAVgAK0SGk-yTfe48Qpw,19,UCgERDCYii8

Its early origins and initial geographical starting point still remain a mystery but in the Summer of 1918, there was a second wave of a far more virulent form of the influenza virus than anyone could have anticipated. Soon dubbed ‘Spanish Flu’ after its effects were reported in the country’s newspapers, the virus rapidly spread across much of the globe to become one of the worst natural disasters in human history. To mark the centenary and to highlight vital scientific research, the University of Cambridge has made a new film exploring what we have learnt about Spanish Flu, the urgent threat posed by influenza today, and how scientists are preparing for future pandemics.",PT11M3S,11/30/18,11/30/18,11131,Cambridge University,/channel/UCc5vZEM1MLUzCrg_aZIJdeA,UCc5vZEM1MLUzCrg_aZIJdeA,20,3x1aLAw_xkY

Since those imperial days, it has lost considerable ground in its former domains. Only in Africa did France retain its hold, owing to the monetary system that was put in place. In the decade after World War II, President François Mitterand was quoted saying: “Without Africa, France will have no history in the 21st century.” Like a foretelling coming true, it is precisely because of Africa that modern-day France is returning as the global force it once was.

How Elon Musk Took Tesla To Hell And Back With The Model 3,News & Politics,1016124,"13,710","1,818","In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called Tesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would transform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would want— affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. In 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.Over the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit. Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a “hell of a ride,” and he took Wall Street along with him. Here’s the wild story of how Tesla started an EV revolution.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Sir Roger Penrose: What We All Need to Know About Physics,News & Politics,128154,"1,195",50,"Roger Penrose, Theoretical Physicist; Author, Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe In conversation with Dr. David Eisenbud, director, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and Professor of Mathematics, University of California, BerkeleyHere’s a chance to meet one of the world’s most renowned scientific thinkers. Sir Roger Penrose, colleague of Stephen Hawking and acclaimed theoretical physicist, will separate fiction from reality when it comes to physics and discuss the fact-based truths of the universe.In his provocative new book, Penrose argues that fashion, faith, and fantasy, while sometimes productive and even essential in physics, may be leading today's researchers astray in three of the field's most important areas—string theory, quantum mechanics and cosmology. Arguing that string theory has veered away from physical reality by positing six extra hidden dimensions, Penrose cautions that the fashionable nature of a theory can cloud our judgment of its plausibility. In the case of quantum mechanics, its stunning success in explaining the atomic universe has led to an uncritical faith that it must also apply to reasonably massive objects, and Penrose responds with suggestions for possible changes in quantum theory. Turning to cosmology, he argues that most of the current fantastical ideas about the origins of the universe cannot be true, but that an even wilder reality may lie behind them. Penrose even describes how fashion, faith, and fantasy have ironically also shaped his own work.Come for a discussion that will illuminate physics and its significance to all of us.",PT67M9S,10/5/16,10/5/16,311243,Commonwealth Club,/channel/UC78euTMh9KcVbql3UeWOqBw,UC78euTMh9KcVbql3UeWOqBw,19,QNqnbELDO5A

That is according to physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.Dyson says, “As measured from space, the whole earth is growing greener as a result of carbon dioxide, so it’s increasing agricultural yields, it’s increasing the forests and it’s increasing growth in the biological world, and that’s more important and more certain than the effects on climate.”He acknowledges that human activity has an effect on climate but claims it is much less than is claimed.

Does Body Language Prove Bob Lazar Actually Worked On Alien Spacecraft At Area 51?,News & Politics,1867780,"56,463","4,567","Did Bob Lazar actually work on recovered alien spacecraft at Area 51 for the U.S. Government? We’re going to analyze his body language to find out.Bob Lazar claims to be a scientist who worked on alien spacecraft at Area 51 (S4) for the U.S. Government in the late 1980s.Especially for this video, it’s important for you to know if I have any biases going into this. I’ve never seen a UFO or aliens, but, like many, I believe we’re probably not completely alone in the universe. Prior to doing this analysis, haven’t heard of Bob Lazar and when I did, thought he’s at least a little deceitful because his story is so extraordinary. What’s interesting is that over the past few years, the U.S. Government has become more open to admitting the existence of this UFO stuff. Interesting that the U.S. Government isn’t completely ignoring these claims anymore.  Probably because when something odd is seen, it can now be easily recorded since cameras are everywhere, and once it’s recorded, the internet can spread it across the world in seconds.What’s interesting about all this is someone’s lying, it’s either the U.S. Government for totally hiding and covering all this up or it’s Bob Lazar. So we’re going to put our neutral hats on to analyze Bob Lazar’s body language, piece together his story, and review the evidence to find out if he is truthful or just lying.Now in the comments, why do you think the U.S. Government seems to be trying to hide all this from us?

The History of Japan Documentary,Education,1473301,"4,294",615,"The history of Japan covers Japan and its relation to the world. It is characterized by isolationist, semi-open and expansionist periods.The very first human habitation in the Japanese archipelago has been traced to prehistoric times around 30,000 BCE. The Jōmon period, named after its ""cord-marked"" pottery, was followed by the Yayoi in the first millennium BC when new technologies were introduced from continental Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese Book of Han in the first century AD. Between the fourth century and the ninth century, Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the Emperor. This imperial dynasty continues to reign over Japan. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), marking the beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until 1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture. Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native Shinto practices and Buddhism.Over the following centuries, the power of the Emperor and the imperial court gradually declined, passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats – most notably the Fujiwara – and then to the military clans and their armies of samurai. The Minamoto clan under Minamoto no Yoritomo emerged victorious from the Genpei War of 1180–85, defeating their rival military clan, the Taira. After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in Kamakura and took the title of shōgun. In 1274 and 1281, the Kamakura shogunate withstood two Mongol invasions, but in 1333 it was toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the Muromachi period. During the Muromachi period regional warlords called daimyōs grew in power at the expense of the shōgun. Eventually, Japan descended into a period of civil war. Over the course of the late sixteenth century, Japan was reunified under the leadership of the prominent daimyō Oda Nobunaga and his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu came to power and was appointed shōgun by the Emperor. The Tokugawa shogunate, which governed from Edo (modern Tokyo), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the Edo period (1600–1868). The Tokugawa shogunate imposed a strict class system on Japanese society and cut off almost all contact with the outside world.This video is made for educational purposes only.COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER UNDER SECTION 107 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT 1976Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for ""fair use"" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Should you take Vitamin D and Vitamin C?,Education,1470167,"40,151","2,179","Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Should you take Vitamin D and Vitamin C?#coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19Link to Get Vitamin D:https://amzn.to/35osavPCoronavirus | COVID-19 YouTube Video Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Does colder temperature make you more prone to getting a cold Or COVID-19?Most health experts agree that when it’s cold, people spend more time indoors and in close contact with other people, and this likely increases the spread of germs.Also, experts believe that our immune system may be more active when our body is warmer, as in during the summer months.Back in 2007, there was this study…https://journals.plos.org/plospathoge...In this one particular study looking at the spread of the influenza virus, they put guinea pigs together in a chamber and carried out different environmental experiments on them. They found that low relative humidities of 20%–35% were most favorable for infection, while the transmission was completely blocked at high humidity of 80%.They also found that when guinea pigs were kept at 5 °C, transmission occurred with greater frequency than at 20 °C, while at 30 °C, no transmission was detected.The authors concluded that low relative humidities produced by indoor heating and coldtemperatures favored the spread of the influenza virus.I also want to add, that cold weather, by itself, can cause a runny nose without necessarilyhaving a cold, and this allows for the virus so be carried in those secretions, which probably facilitates transmission.40% of common colds are caused by rhinoviruses. The second most common cause ofcold is the coronavirus, the normal one, not this novel coronavirus, aka SARS-CoV-2.Its been shown that the rhinovirus reproduces more quickly at cooler temperatures means you might catch a cold more quickly if you’re chilly.And this probably applies to the coronavirus as well.It's likely that with the combination of all of these 5 factors, meaning, cooler temp, lowerhumidity, people staying indoors more often in winter months, cold weather causing runny noses and our immune system is more active when it's warmer, these combinations of factors likely explain why colds, flu,, and COVID-19 are more likely to cause infections in the winter months.But there is likely a 6th factor as well. And that is vitamin D. Our bodies don’t normally make vitamin D unless we get sunlight. In the winter months, for most of us in this world, we don’t get enough sunlight to make enough vitamin D. Unless you live in a warm climate, then maybe you are the exception. So if you aren’t getting enough sunlight in the winter months, that means you have to get enough vitamin D in your diet. And if you don’t do that, you will have low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D helps regulate or Calcium levels and is important for bone and muscle health. It also plays a role in regulating our immune system, but its exact role is not known.Why is this important when it comes to the common cold, flu, and perhaps with this novelthe coronavirus that’s causing COVID-19? Well, vitamin D doesn’t affect these viruses themselves. Instead, it affects our immune systems.So what is my recommendation for taking Vitamin D?The best thing to do is check with your doctor to see if you might have low vitamin D, and if it is low, you’ll def need to get more vitamin D, especially during the winter months.Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is vital to the function of white blood cells that help to fight infections, and overall immune system health. Vitamin C is also important for iron absorption, and being deficient in iron can make you more vulnerable to infections in general.The normal, recommended daily intake of vitamin C for adults from the diet and/or supplements is 75 to 120 mg. You can get about 80 to 90 mg from a cup of orange juice or sliced orange, or even more from kiwi fruit, or a cup of sweet peppers.Zinc has become one of the most popular suggestions for reducing symptoms of coronavirus.Some studies showed that zinc reduces the duration of a cold by half, while others showed no effect. Another study found that the type of zinc taken determined the result—zinc gluconate lozenges that provided 13.3 milligrams (mg) of zinc lessened the duration of colds, but zinc acetate lozenges that provided 5 mg or 11.5 mg of zinc did not.Note: Please watch the whole video to get the proper details, for the character limitation of the youtube description, I couldn't provide the whole details, so I suggest you watch the whole video.Dr. Mike Hansen, MDInternal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care MedicineWebsite: https://doctormikehansen.com/Please subscribe to my channel and press the bell icon: https://www.youtube.com/c/DoctorMikeH...#coronavirus #covid19 #covid_19",PT12M41S,3/9/20,3/9/20,111341,Doctor Mike Hansen,/channel/UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A,UCMSsLqxqvZsNXi0Z-VjN89A,20,UAHhhweamIU

This virus, we know, is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, and through contact, by getting into our mucosa, like our mouth, nose, and eyes. Although less common, it also can be transmitted through aerosol, meaning airborne. Most likely when you have people in an enclosed space, such as an elevator, and someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouths, and someone else can inhale it in. This virus attaches to cells in our body by this ACE2 receptor. This ACE2 receptor is only located on certain cells in our body. It's on our tongue, in our nose, back of the throat, and in our lungs. Specifically, within the lungs, it's only located on our type II alveolar cells. We know that ARDS develops in about 4 to 5% of COVID-19 patients. And of all the people who get COVID19, the mortality rate is around 1 to 2%. So why do some COVID-19 patients get ARDS, and why do some die? There are different reasons, and let's talk about them. It could be one of these reasons, but more likely it’s a combination of these reasons.1) The virus only gains entry into our cells that express the ACE2 receptor. They are located in multiple sites. Besides being in the lung, they’re in your mouth, nose, throat, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and testes.2) It makes sense that if the virus only gets into your mouth or nose or throat, but not the lungs, that it would cause only cold-like symptoms. But if the virus gets all the way down into the alveoli of your lungs, that’s what's going to cause ARDS.  And by the way, the ACE2 receptors in your gut probably explains why some patients get nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 3) The amount of virus that you get into your body likely determines how sick you get. This is what we call the viral load. 4) The inflammatory reaction that occurs with COVID-19 is extremely complicated with lots of different proteins and hormones and interleukins at play. But there are several known genetic polymorphisms of these proteins that likely make some people more prone to getting worse illnesses than others. A genetic polymorphism simply means a variation on a particular gene. For example, there are genetic polymorphisms for the ACE gene, as well as IL-6. Basically, a lot of it just comes down to our genes.   And sex. 5) Because the 5th reason has to do with estrogen. Estrogen is known to inhibit the effects of IL-6, which plays a huge role in this cytokine storm. This might explain why women overall have less severe disease compared to men. 6) And the 6th reason is because of people who are already taking certain medications. For those people who are already on and ACEI such as lisinopril, or an ARB such as losartan, or telmisartan, or candesartan, or irbesartan. Or people who take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or rheumatoid disease. Or people who take tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor. Are these patients less prone to getting severe illness? My guess is yes.

Better brain health | DW Documentary,Education,2192885,"18,766",593,"Chocolate reduces stress. Fish stimulates the brain. Is there any truth to such popular beliefs? The findings of researchers around the world say yes: It appears we really are what we eat.A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of Lübeck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called ""brain food"" for example: The Mediterranean diet that’s based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Climate refugees in Bangladesh | DW Documentary,Education,93901,"1,002",89,"Within the next 30 years, up to 20% of Bangladesh will disappear beneath the water as rivers and sea levels rise. This will put as many as 30 million people on the move. Climate researchers say it’s just the first manifestation of a process that will soon be happening all over the world. This film takes us on a journey to the Bangladesh of the future, a country that’s set to suffer terribly from climate change. The Meghna River has already turned into a torrent that’s nine kilometers wide in places, a mass of moving water that flows ten times faster than the Rhine. ""It demolished the house I moved into as a bride,” Momtaj Begum says. ""It’s where I gave birth to my four children. It breaks my heart.” She and her son are saving what they can before the river sweeps everything relentlessly into the sea. Her village looks like a battlefield. The Meghna has cut deep into the ground, and is literally ripping the soil away beneath the residents’ feet. Momtaj Begum and her family of eight have already been turned into climate refugees. Her village was swallowed by the river, along with many others. Around 2,000 displaced people like her arrive in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka every day. With a population topping 20 million and a crumbling infrastructure, the city is on the verge of collapse. The climate refugees that arrive here are now forcibly moved on again, this time by the government. Shantytowns are destroyed by police raids and bulldozers. And what’s happening in Bangladesh is only the beginning. Before long, every country in the world will begin to notice the effects of rising sea levels._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Drought and floods — the climate exodus | DW Documentary,Education,283637,"1,841",356,"More people around the world are fleeing from climate change than from war. If human-induced climate change continues at the current rate, the World Bank warns that by 2050 there could be as many as 180 million climate refugees.The number of climate refugees is rising - and yet the status of ‘climate refugee’ has yet to be officially recognized by national or international law. One factor is illustrative of the devastating impact of climate change on countries and communities: water. Recent years have seen an increasing number of floods and droughts. A third of the global population lives near the coast, and an estimated 700 million people are facing rising sea levels. In the Philippines more than 85 percent of the population say they are feeling the impact of climate change in the rising frequency of flooding and violent typhoons. Farmers in the highlands of Guatemala, on the other hand, are suffering extreme drought. Both water scarcity and flooding are sparking mass migration. In response, rich countries such as the US are tightening their immigration policies. Yet lifestyles within industrialized nations are a major cause of climate change. Seven countries — including the US, China, Russia, India and Germany — are responsible for over 60 percent of global CO2 emissions. The US is the country with the highest emissions, yet it also has the most climate change deniers - notably President Donald Trump. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. He is also an advocate of fossil fuels and wants to build a wall to keep out migrants. Meanwhile, climate activist Greta Thunberg is fighting for change with her ‘Fridays for Future’ movement, and many others around the world are protesting in hopes of mitigating the impending climate catastrophe. Nonetheless, most people in affluent countries are unwilling to change their lifestyles. They are the ones who have a choice. For the countless thousands of climate refugees who are fleeing their homes, it is their very survival that is at stake.Every two seconds, a person is forced to flee their home. Today, more than 70 million people have been displaced worldwide. The DW documentary series ‘Displaced’ sheds light on the causes of this crisis and traces how wealthy industrialized countries are contributing to the exodus from the Global South.Tomatoes and greed – the exodus of Ghana's farmers: https://youtu.be/rlPZ0Bev99sOil and ruin — exodus from Venezuela: https://youtu.be/PjyX5dnhaMw--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Hürtgen forest and the end of World War II | Free Full DW Documentary,Education,221474,"3,373",127,"Thousands of soldiers were killed in the last battles of World War II. US troops who fought in the Hürtgen Forest nicknamed it the ""Death Factory."" This documentary features original film from US archives that bring the battle back to life.It's estimated that as many as 30 thousand US and German soldiers were killed in fighting in the northern Eifel region of Germany in the autumn and winter of 1944 and 1945. Traces of the battle - old bunkers, munitions, trenches and tank tracks - are still visible even today. The scarred landscape bears witness to a little-known chapter of World War Two. The ""Hürtgen Forest"" was the last obstacle standing between US forces and the Rhine River and Ruhr. Yet the decision to advance into the thick forest in September 1944 proved to be a fatal mistake. The Americans completely miscalculated North Eifel region's rugged terrain. They became disoriented in an area the German forces, the Wehrmacht, had crisscrossed with trenches and peppered with anti-personnel mines, making the wood into a veritable fortress. Continual rain and fog, followed by snow and frigid temperatures, turned the battle into a scene of dystopian butchery. Author Ernest Hemingway spent 18 days on the front in the Hürtgen Forest. He wrote later, ""It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there."" This documentary reconstructs the stages of the battle using commentary from survivors of the clash. Among them are the well-known US photographer Tony Vaccaro, US Army veteran James K. Cullen and former Wehrmacht soldier Paul Verbeek. In addition, Hürtgen Forest residents tell of the legacy of the battle, including the threat posed by countless unexploded munitions left in the ground 75 years after the conflict in Europe ended.",PT42M27S,5/2/20,5/2/20,113123,DW Documentary,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,20,tT0ob3cHPmE

North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions?

Fleeing climate change — the real environmental disaster | DW Documentary,Education,549194,"4,975","1,114","How many millions of people will be forced to leave their homes by 2050? This documentary looks at the so-called hotspots of climate change in the Sahel zone, Indonesia and the Russian Tundra.Lake Chad in the Sahel zone has already shrunk by 90 percent since the 1960s due to the increasing heat. About 40 million people will be forced to migrate to places where there is enough rainfall. Migration has always existed as a strategy to adapt to a changing environment. But the number of those forced to migrate solely because of climate change has increased dramatically since the 1990s. It is a double injustice: after becoming rich at the expense of the rest of the world, the industrialized countries are now polluting the atmosphere with their emissions and bringing a second misfortune to the inhabitants of the poorer regions. One of them is Mohammed Ibrahim: as Lake Chad got hotter and drier, he decided to go where the temperatures were less extreme and there was still a little water, trekking with his wife, children and 70 camels from Niger to Chad and then further south. The journey lasted several years and many members of his herd died of thirst. Now he and his family are living in a refugee camp: they only have seven camels left. Mohammed is one of many who have left their homelands in the Sahel - not because of conflict and crises, but because of the high temperatures. He's a real climate refugee._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

Traveling Iran by train | DW Documentary,Education,4363926,"22,195","2,257","Iran is opening its doors to foreigners and a train ride from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea is a great way to get to know the country and its people.The travel restrictions that are now being lifted were in place for decades. Many Iranians are hoping they will now be able to lead a freer life – and we meet many of these hospitable and welcoming people on our journey through the Middle Eastern nation. The country’s most important rail link, the Trans-Iranian Railway, runs for approximately 1400 kilometers from the Persian Gulf via Teheran to the Caspian Sea. The journey starts in Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab, the river border between Iraq and Iran.Traveling past oil fields, the train reaches Shushtar. One of the top sights here is the historic hydraulic system, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. After that, the train heads up into the Zagros Mountains. The journey is interrupted by a break for prayer. Breath-taking landscapes move past the train window until we reach the highest point not only of our journey but of the entire rail network: 2,200 meters above sea level between Dorud and Arak.During a brief stop in Qom, travelers can refuel with sohan, a pastry made of wheat germ, flour and sugar. The next section of the track is high-speed and we continue on to Teheran at 160 km/h. The metropolitan area is home to more than 15 million people. The last leg takes us to the north of the country.In the Alborz Mountains, we find out what role the Trans-Iranian Railway played during Stalin’s major offensive against the German army in World War II. Our oriental rail adventure ends in Bandar-e Torkaman on the Caspian Sea._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Testosterone — new discoveries about the male hormone | DW Documentary,Education,967584,"10,690",626,"Testosterone has long been seen as a metaphor for aggression, but is there really anything to the idea of the testosterone-driven male? Prominent scientists explain how subtle the hormone’s effects actually are. Men with a lot of testosterone have long been accused of violent and competitive behavior. Now the image of the sex hormone is changing. Unlike in the animal world, the general statement ""testosterone makes one aggressive"" cannot be confirmed in humans, and recent studies suggest that it can actually even promote selfless behavior. One of the leading experts in this field is Jean-Claude Dreher from Lyon. He says his laboratory experiments show that testosterone does not make men aggressive but instead allows them to act in a strategic manner. Those who are more testosterone-charged tend to be friendlier towards others in order to bolster their own social status. British behavioral psychologist Simon Baron Cohen demonstrates how testosterone determines our gender characteristics when we are still in the womb. Meanwhile, his colleague Oliver Schultheiss from Erlangen has found out how testosterone can improve our learning abilities.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Inequality – how wealth becomes power (1/3) | DW Documentary (poverty richness documentary),Education,1930359,"21,167","1,548","Germany is one of the world’s richest countries, but inequality is on the rise. The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. For the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gröner, one of Germany’s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. ""If you have great wealth, you can’t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,” Gröner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts.  ""Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we’re more independent,” Gröner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanović, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. ""These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,"" Milanović notes. ""Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?”_______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

Inequality: how wealth becomes power (3/3) | (Poverty Richness Documentary) DW Documentary,Education,167908,"2,510",74,"How much power do people with a lot of money really have? Who decides how Germany should look? These questions are the subject of the film ""Land of Inequality - Power.” Many studies show that a small but wealthy part of society defines a country’s political direction. It’s the same all over the world. German researchers evaluated hundreds of opinion polls on the topics of the economy, environment, foreign policy and finance. They then examined what poor people wanted from politics on these issues - and what the rich did. The differences were clear: ""An obvious example is taxes on property,” says Armin Schäfer, a political scientist at the University of Munster. ""Higher income groups are more skeptical about any reintroduction of a property tax, whereas lower income groups definitely want it. So far, we have not reintroduced a property tax in that form.” So who gets to decide what Germany looks like? To find out, our film follows building contractor Christoph Gröner, who has made millions from the construction business. Gröner wants to build an entire new district in Cologne, which is facing a severe housing shortfall and where rents are soaring and the poor in particular feel ignored. But he has faced delays in getting building permits. Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker says: ""It is a city’s job to provide land and grant building permits.” But can’t it do that faster? Gröner says the politicians should take their foot off the brakes. To show how much power money really wields, we go to the places where politics and economics come together - to the district town halls and the VIP box at a Bundesliga stadium. And to Europe's largest real estate show in Cannes, where billionaire investors use their financial clout to shape cities and regions as they wish.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Kiribati: a drowning paradise in the South Pacific | DW Documentary,Education,4807671,"22,237","2,830","Climate change and rising sea levels mean the island nation of Kiribati in the South Pacific is at risk of disappearing into the sea. But the island’s inhabitants aren’t giving up. They are doing what they can to save their island from inundation. Can COP23 help make a difference?UN estimates indicate that Kiribati could disappear in just 30 or 40 years. That’s because the average elevation is less than two meters above sea level. And some of the knock-on effects of climate change have made the situation more difficult. Kiribati can hardly be surpassed in terms of charm and natural beauty. There are 33 atolls and one reef island – spread out over an area of 3.5 million square kilometers. All have white, sandy beaches and blue lagoons. Kiribati is the world’s largest state that consists exclusively of atolls. A local resident named Kaboua points to the empty, barren land around him and says, ""There used to be a large village here with 70 families."" But these days, this land is only accessible at low tide. At high tide, it's all under water. Kaboua says that sea levels are rising all the time, and swallowing up the land. That’s why many people here build walls made of stone and driftwood, or sand or rubbish. But these barriers won't stand up to the increasing number of storm surges. Others are trying to protect against coastal erosion by planting mangrove shrubs or small trees. But another local resident, Vasiti Tebamare, remains optimistic. She works for KiriCAN, an environmental organization. Vasiti says: ""The industrialized countries -- the United States, China, and Europe -- use fossil fuels for their own ends. But what about us?"" Kiribati's government has even bought land on an island in Fiji, so it can evacuate its people in an emergency. But Vasiti and most of the other residents don't want to leave._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Inequality – how wealth becomes power (2/3) | DW Documentary (poverty richness documentary),Education,455751,"4,374",212,"Christoph Gröner is one of the richest people in Germany. The son of two teachers, he has worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance and wants to step in. But can this really ease inequality?Christoph Gröner does everything he can to drum up donations and convince the wealthy auction guests to raise their bids. The more the luxury watch for sale fetches, the more money there will be to pay for a new football field, or some extra tutoring, at a children's home. Christoph Gröner is one of the richest people in Germany - his company is now worth one billion euros, he tells us. For seven months, he let our cameras follow him - into board meetings, onto construction sites, through his daily life, and in his charity work. He knows that someone like him is an absolute exception in Germany. His parents were both teachers, and he still worked his way to the top. He believes that many children in Germany grow up without a fair chance. ""What we see here is total failure across the board,” he says. ""It starts with parents who just don’t get it and can’t do anything right. And then there’s an education policy that has opened the gates wide to the chaos we are experiencing today."" Chistoph Gröner wants to step in where state institutions have failed. But can that really ease inequality? In Germany, getting ahead depends more on where you come from than in most other industrialized countries, and social mobility is normally quite restricted. Those on top stay on top. The same goes for those at the bottom. A new study shows that Germany’s rich and poor both increasingly stay amongst themselves, without ever intermingling with other social strata. Even the middle class is buckling under the mounting pressure of an unsecure future. ""Land of Inequality"" searches for answers as to why. We talk to families, an underpaid nurse, as well as leading researchers and analysts such as economic Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz, sociologist Jutta Allmendinger or the economist Raj Chetty, who conducted a Stanford investigation into how the middle class is now arming itself to improve their children’s outlooks._______ Watch Part I Inequality - how wealth becomes power https://youtu.be/AFIxi7BiScIPart 3 Inequality - how wealth becomes powerhttps://youtu.be/wEufTD39xrwDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4877602,"51,985","3,556","Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How the rich get richer – money in the world economy | DW Documentary,Education,4586650,"39,389","2,617","Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market – the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? For years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: ""This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

15 MAJOR CRUISE SHIP CHANGES Coming to Cruising After the Crisis.,People & Blogs,367310,"4,587",179,"Subscribe to the Eat Sleep Cruise YouTube Channel if you love to travel and cruise the world! https://www.youtube.com/c/EatSleepCru... Cruising has been suspended until at least mid-May and probably longer. In order for cruising to resume, cruise lines will certainly be required to implement stricter protocols and change policies. In this video, we share our predictions for the future of cruising  with the 15 Ways Cruising Could Change Once the Cruise Suspension is Lifted.If you enjoy the video, please make sure to give it a BIG THUMBS UP! We can certainly see the cruise lines being forced to implement more stringent health screenings  prior to cruising, along with more rigorous embarkation protocols. This could include restricting cruising for some individuals, at least temporarily.Certainly, the cruise lines will enhance cleaning procedures and increase the frequency of sanitizing public areas. In addition, it is possible that cruise ships could create crowd control measures. This might include sailing at reduced capacity or limiting the number of individuals in restaurants and entertainment venues. We could see more ships adopting reservation systems that you already find on some mega-ships. Most likely, cruising will start out slow, with only the most popular ships sailing once the cruise suspension is lifted. Also, there is the potential that this halt will impact the planned release of new ships, as well as ship revitalizations for older vessels. Perhaps, cruise lines could even try to sell off older ships that are less profitable. We suspect that cruising could further change in the future, including where cruise ships sail, as well as changes to crew contracts. Check out all of the ways that cruising will be different once the cruise ban is lifted back on the blog. https://eatsleepcruise.com/2020/04/15...Top 10 Things We Miss About Cruising: https://youtu.be/TkQ6ThJGx48Top 10 New Cruise Ships of 2020 https://youtu.be/2ULGCSadPacWhat it is Really Like on Perfect Day at CocoCay! https://youtu.be/WuQUXmVP6JsMake sure to SUBSCRIBE to our channel above to get the latest cruise tips, cruise reviews, packing guides, port guides, travel tips, and more.

9 Ways Your Cruises Will Be Changing After Covid 19,Entertainment,259780,"3,380",190,"The experience of taking a cruise will be forever changed by the covid-19 crisis, cruise ships have been hit HARD by the pandemic and day to day cruise ship life is likely to never return to normal. Everything from booking a cruise, dining onboard and excursions will be affected. Guests will be required to follow much stricter rules, have restrictions enforced on them and accept controls put in place to minimise social contact. Before we start, make sure you hit the subscribe button so that you don’t miss any future videos. I bring you weekly cruise tips, tours and entertainment on this channel. The changes will take place right the way through from booking a cruise to disembarkation. If you are 70+ you can expect to have to provide some sort of doctors note to prove that you are fit to travel. All guests may be required to show proof of travel insurance and the types of cruises that we book may change too.When cases of covid 19 were discovered onboard the Diamond Princess the cruise ship was put into quarantine and guests spent weeks within their cabins. Inside cabins often hold up to 4 or 5 people and being quarantined with 3 other people in an inside cabin is definitely less than ideal. Genting press release: https://www.dreamcruiseline.com/en/me...BookingIt is expected that an increased proportion of guests will now want to book a balcony cabin or a higher grade, this may drive down the prices of inside cabins and we may see more ships built without inside cabins at all. There are already some cruise ships which don’t have inside cabins but these tend to be on the luxury side of the cruise ship scale.Embarking a cruise is usually a pretty easy process, you arrive at the embarkation desk, sign a small piece of paper that says that you haven’t been unwell with the last 48 hours and then you embark. This is likely to change forever. Stricter health screening processes will be put into place worldwide and temperature scanning is likely to be a common fixture. I have had my temperature scanned when boarding a cruise ship before in Japan. The technology is already available, it is possible to take the temperature of many guests at once but will have to be implemented to ports across the world. One of the biggest problems for cruise lines when it comes to illness is preventing large groups of passengers from gathering at any one time. To try and prevent this cruise lines may stagger embarkation times or they may have to provide separate waiting rooms in ports.OnboardBy far the biggest changes will come from the onboard experience. Dining, cleaning and entertainment are three areas set to change dramatically.Genting cruise lines have revealed new healthcare measures that they’ll be taking post covid-19 and this includes the removal of self serve buffets. We can expect this to happen across a lot of cruise lines as it does dramatically decrease the risk of guests infecting one another. The cruise lines in questions will more than likely still have some form of buffets but the food will be served to guests by staff and the cutlery and sauces will not be left on the tables. When it comes to the main dining rooms we may see more space between tables and disposable paper menus may become more popular. Alternatively guests using the cruise lines app may be able to read the menu on their own device rather than requiring a physical menu. Genting cruise lines have already said that they will be implementing both paper menus and disposable cutlery available on request for guests who want it. At present handwashing is highly recommended by cruise lines for guests entering any dining venue but in the future we can expect this to be mandatory. We may also see extra washing stations in places like the theatres, lounges and bars. staff, not only because they care about the guests wellbeing but also because the staff live on the cruise ship. Genting cruises have said that going forward their guests cabins will be cleaned and disinfected twice daily and cabins of sick guests will have to be sterilised to hospital grade.

His enemies were gaining in strength, as Prussia and Sweden joined the Sixth Coalition against him, while Russian armies advanced across Poland and into Germany. The French Emperor worked miracles to raise a new Grande Armée of young conscripts, leading them to victory at Lützen and Bautzen. But Napoleon knew everything might ultimately depend on Austria - which side would his father-in-law,  Austrian Emperor Francis I, chose to support? The matter would be settled after a fateful and ill-tempered meeting in Dresden between Napoleon and Austrian foreign minister von Metternich...Special thanks to Alexander Averyanov for kind permission to use his paintings 'On the Frontier' & 'Horse Guards at the Battle of Borodino'.

So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when 'Гро́зный' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...).

First Crusade Part 1 of 2,Education,2369717,"34,266","1,164","The First Crusade was one of the most extraordinary, bloody and significant episodes in medieval history. It began with an appeal for aid from the Christian Byzantine Empire, threatened by the rising power of the Muslim Seljuk Turks. But when Pope Urban II preached a sermon at Clermont in 1095, the result was unlike anything ever seen before. The Pope offered spiritual salvation to those willing to go east to aid their fellow Christians in a holy war,  and help liberate Jerusalem from Muslim rule. Knights and peasants alike signed up in their thousands, leading to the disastrous People's, or Peasants', Crusade, then to a much more organised and powerful Princes' Crusade. Their forces gathered at Constantinople, where they made an uneasy alliance with Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. Entering Anatolia, they helped to win back the city of Nicaea, then won a decisive but hard-fought victory at Dorlyaeum, before marching on the great city of Antioch...Ver este video en español https://youtu.be/P_rA2cD4V3oProduced in partnership with Osprey Publishinghttps://ospreypublishing.com/Campaign: The First Crusade 1096–99https://ospreypublishing.com/the-firs...Essential Histories: The Crusadeshttps://ospreypublishing.com/the-crus...The Armies of Islam 7th–11th Centuries https://ospreypublishing.com/the-armi...Armies of the Crusadeshttps://ospreypublishing.com/armies-o...Music with thanks to Filmstro: https://www.filmstro.com/Get 20% off an annual license!

Outnumbered, virtually encircled, Napoleon opted for a high-risk strategy of striking against Scwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia, before the other Coalition armies could come to his aid. The four-day Battle of Leipzig would be the largest and bloodiest battle in European history before the First World War, and one that changed the destiny of Europe. 🎶🎶music from Filmstro https://www.filmstro.com Get 20% off an annual license with this exclusive code: EPICHISTORYTV_ANNThemes used in this video: 0.00 Nanga; 1.13 Centurion; 3.29 Agent; 4.41 Oracabessa; 6.00 Major Incursion; 8.55 Renegade; 12.11 Kilimanjaro; 14.30 Turbulence; 16.03 Major Incursion; 18.03 Parbat; 20.46 Turbulence; 24.01 Major Incursion; 25.19 Viking; 26.24 Earthquake; 27.18 Renegade; 28.08 Nanga; 29.12 Skynet; 29.54 Barbarian 🎶 Additional music from Kevin MacLeod (incompetetch.com):'Egmont Overture', Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...👕 Buy EHTV t-shirts, hoodies, mugs and stickers here! https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/ep...Thank you to our series partner Osprey Publishing https://ospreypublishing.com/📚Recommended reading (as an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases):📖Leipzig 1813: The Battle of the Nations https://geni.us/fZqo📖The Napoleonic Wars by Todd Fisher http://geni.us/R5ZI9c📖Combat: French Guardsman vs Russian Jäger 1812-14 https://geni.us/rWnOT📖Napoleon and the Struggle for Germany Vol 1 by Michael Leggiere https://geni.us/2WfiBe📖1813: Leipzig - Napoleon & the Battle of the Nations by Digby Smith https://geni.us/GMqpsG1📖Napoleon's Wars by Charles Esdaile https://geni.us/NBrP📖Napoleon the Great by Andrew Roberts http://geni.us/NqMW🎶🎶music from Filmstro https://www.filmstro.com Get 20% off an annual license with this exclusive code: EPICHISTORYTV_ANN🎶 Additional music from Kevin MacLeod (incompetetch.com):'Intrepid', Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...Support Epic History TV on Patreon from $1 per video, and get perks including ad-free early access & votes on future topics.https://www.patreon.com/EpicHistoryTV#EpicHistoryTV #NapoleonicWars #Napoleon",PT33M16S,3/26/20,3/26/20,312143,Epic History TV,/channel/UCvPXiKxH-eH9xq-80vpgmKQ,UCvPXiKxH-eH9xq-80vpgmKQ,18,P9hDA0u6FO0

27 YEARS Living Off-Grid on a Self-Built Island Homestead,Howto & Style,3140875,"61,466","1,194","Freedom Cove is a rare and very special place.  It's a man-made floating island that acts as a homestead, an art installation, and a home to Catherine and Wayne in Tofino, BC, Canada.  The project started with a small float home that was built using wood that had washed ashore after a storm, and since moving into it in 1992, they've gradually added new buildings, greenhouses, and an outdoor dance floor to create a fully off-grid, floating homestead where they can grow most of their own food, earn a living as artists, and reduce their environmental footprint.They have used as much reclaimed material as possible, including the flotation technology that has been discarded from nearby fish farms over the years.The site where they chose to settle in was chosen specifically because it had a fresh water source above sea level so they could have gravity fed water, and because the cove provided protection from winter storms.They use a mix of solar panels, a generator, propane and firewood for their various energy needs, and they have a new microbial wastewater system that will allow them to fully purify their waste.  Before that, they had a tank that could be emptied in open water like most boats and vessels do.Catherine King and Wayne Adams are artists and carvers who make beautiful work and showcase some of it in their floating gallery.If you'd like to visit Freedom Cove in Tofino, BC, you can book a tour with Browning Pass here: http://www.browningpass.com/freedom-c...Or you can reach out directly to Catherine and Wayne by email at: freedomcove4@gmail.comSpecial thank you to Shane for the good chats and the boat rides!Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle-------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!-------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: /exploringalternativesblogInstagram: @exploringalternatives-------------------------------------------------------------COMMENTS-------------------------------------------------------------We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.

Family of 5 Living Off-Grid | BOAT ACCESS ONLY,Howto & Style,1978939,"42,538","1,183","Mark and Chera rescued and renovated an old cabin and transformed it into an epic off-grid home for their family of 5.  The catch?  There's no road to get there, so they had to figure out how to do absolutely everything by boat and barge: transporting building materials, equipment, belongings, workers, as well as commuting to and from town for school and work.They were limited in how much they could modify the existing cabin, so to make space for the kids' bedrooms, they attached a yurt to the house with a mudroom.  For heat, they have a wood stove in the house, a pellet stove in the yurt (to keep a constant temperature for the kids), and backup wall-mount propane heaters for really cold days, or times when they're away from the house during winter (to prevent pipes from freezing).  Since propane has to be delivered on a barge, it's really expensive so they try to limit their propane use as much as possible.For electricity, they have 3 systems.  First, a solar power system with 18 panels and a large battery bank which works great in the summer even though they're surrounded by mountains.  But during the colder, rainier months, the system doesn't keep everything running so they installed a hydro turbine which creates electricity using water pressure from a creek up the hill, and this provides 24 hour electricity for most of the year.  As a backup to these two systems, they have a propane generator but they try not to use it unless they need to.The kids still attend school in town, and Mark and Chera have flexible jobs so they can work in town or from home as needed.  They have 2 enclosed boats with GPS and heat for the 20 minute commute back and forth to town.We loved getting the chance to spend a whole day and night with this lovely family and seeing how they've made off-grid living comfortable and fun for everyone!

Reconquista - The Full History,Education,522568,"7,445",449,"The history of the Reconquista was a 781 year medieval journey. It was the story of the Christian War of Reconquest against Islamic Spain. A struggle that was not always constant or consistent. The Christian kingdoms of the northern Iberian Peninsula held their ground, clinging to survival. In time, as the initiative shifted and the great Caliphate fell; Asturias, Leon, Castile, Navarre, Aragon, and Portugal would have the chance to press the offensive. They were hampered along the way by the Almoravids and later the Almohads - and of course fought amongst themselves.

Medusae have been found as deep as 8.300 meters. Their existence is paramount to the oceans. Many of the large migrations of fish and mammals would not be possible without the existence of jellies. They are a crucial part of the food chain, many fish feed on jellies and in turn mammals or larger migratory predators feed on fish.The scientist Gerhard Jarms of the Zoological Institute of the University of Hamburg takes us on a journey into the exotic world of jellyfish. He is one of the most renowned medusae scientists in the world. Our expedition begins in the northern Atlantic where we will find the mysterious periphylla. We will continue on to the Azores in the Atlantic. There we will search for the XY jellies that seek shelter in caves in rough seas. In the Pacific we will swim with the jellies in the famous Jellyfish Lake and last but not least we will explore some of the world's most beautiful coral reefs of western Papua. And at the very end danger lurks around every corner as we set out to search off Australia's coast for the fatal sea wasp- one of the most poisonous ocean inhabitants.

Bizarre animal appearances,Travel & Events,3409686,"12,111",955,"Animals shock us with the most bizarre appearances - some even look like they've been dressing up. But the weird and wonderful shapes and colours of nature are vital to the animals' lives. Sometimes they're disguised to help blend in, other times they are designed to stand out and show off. But whether it's a monkey in make-up or a salamander's toxic stripes, the weird and wonderful outfits enable the creature to thrive.The obvious place to start exploring animal outfits is the colourful parrots. The birds dazzling hues are not all caused by pigment, but more a clever reflection of the light. Bright, vibrant plumage is very attractive to a bird of the opposite sex - it demonstrates that the wearer is in good health, but surprisingly the main function of their bold markings is camouflage. There is an alternative to blending in. Some animals use colourful costumes to make themselves stand out. In the case of bold and bright tree frogs and salamanders, it's to warn would be attackers of toxins in their skins. Intimidation can also be used in the mating game, when a male wants to make himself bigger and more intimidating to his competitors. Many birds flaunt elaborate plumage to make themselves look more dramatic. The king of courting costume though is the peacock. With a two metre tail span, covered in colourful, eyelike markings, he's hard to ignore. But while some creature costumes are easy to explain, others remain a mystery.Animals dressing up might seem colourful to us, but perhaps it's not so strange - there is no species that enjoys putting on a costume as much as we do!",PT50M1S,1/12/18,1/12/18,241131,Free High-Quality Documentaries,/channel/UC_g32e3JeECjEuRbk-loywg,UC_g32e3JeECjEuRbk-loywg,19,YqS35WMrCZg

The tiny island comprises just 25 sqm² and is covered by an impenetrable jungle. Numerous streams, waterfalls and gorges epitomise the world‘s largest uninhabited rain forest island. Due to its isolation, unique flora and fauna have developed here. Today, as a national park and world natural heritage, the island is closely supervised by park rangers. The outstanding underwater world surrounding the island abounds with marine fauna of every description.

Animals building skills,Travel & Events,6193796,"38,287","2,593","Everyone needs a place to live, but some aren't happy with the great outdoors, they look for some home comforts - they use extraordinary specialist building skills to construct the perfect home. Homes have many uses. They can prove a bolthole to escape predators, a safe nursery in which to raise young, a food store and a shelter from bad weather. Animals of many shapes and sizes build their own homes. Perhaps the biggest construction projects are those undertaken by ants. Hundreds of thousands work together to construct their home. Small mammals are expert diggers. Meerkats and hamsters both excavate elaborate tunnels where they can stay out of harm's way and raise their young, though the hamster likes to work alone while the meerkats prefer to have the company of an entire clan. When it comes to making a nursery, it’s birds who steal the show. In just a few days they can construct a basket of twigs - a nest that can support their growing family and keep them out of harm's way. There is one other good builder in the animal kingdom - us. Did we learn our skills from the animal home builders?",PT50M1S,1/12/18,1/12/18,24113,Free High-Quality Documentaries,/channel/UC_g32e3JeECjEuRbk-loywg,UC_g32e3JeECjEuRbk-loywg,20,9BVW6eoe9bI
Primeval squids - In the hunting grounds of the mysterious Cephalopods,Travel & Events,2316712,"10,307","1,103","Octopuses and squids are anything but cuddly pets. They have neither legs nor fins. Instead, they have snakelike arms, covered in suction caps - eight or ten, dangerous tentacles, which grow out of their heads. To add to their bizarre appearance, they are soft flabby, void of vertebrae or bones. When in danger, they emit foul-smelling ink. They originate from a time before humans walked the earth; from the primeval period, before fish populated the oceans. It is therefore hardly surprising, that these cephalopods seem so strange and disconcerting to us.Our film trip takes us to the Sea of Cortez, to the Socorro Islands, where fish are in abundance. It is here that we want to find the legend-ary Humboldt squid, to capture its nocturnal hunt for food on camera. Mantas, white-tip reef sharks, sea lions and dolphins accompany us. Before our late night rendezvous with the squids, we get some close ups of the sophisticated hunting techniques of swordfish, or Merlin. On Vancouver Island, we accompany Karen Palmer and David Pickles, experts on giant octopi, on their search for the eight-armed cephalo-pods.

Even homes without solar PV can save money via off-peak electricity tariffs whilst also helping to reduce the reliance on the “dirtiest, most expensive” electricity that generally has to be generated during peak times in the day. Peak shaving using a battery, basically!For more information about Joju Solar please visit: https://www.jojusolar.co.uk/tesla-pow...Dr. Chris explains the 3-phase supply questions from the comments:""The grid operators look at the worst possible case for export in their calculations. They look at 5.5kW of solar being produced, with 10kW of power from the batteries, and no loads, and see if the grid can handle this 15.5kW of export (in this case they found it couldn't on 1-phase).  In real life, you wouldn’t see the solar producing its maximum and the batteries fully discharging at the same time, so the grid operators are being very cautious here.  Indeed the batteries are designed to discharge such that no electricity goes back to the grid!  The grid connection regulations were initially set up for back-up generators; if Robert had a 15kW diesel generator in his home these rules would make sense.  But they do seem a bit dated to work for modern solar/battery systems.""====Shot by Nick Poole nickpoolecreator.com, Ben Bruton-Cox @brutoncox, and Stuart Lanceley @slanceleyEdited by Stuart Lanceley @slanceleyMusic: 'Glitz' by Ray Davies (PRS) on Audio Network.Many thanks to Andy Mewes for the additional screen recording footage!------We couldn't keep making the show without our supporters, thank you all!If you enjoy our videos and you'd like to help us to make more episodes of Fully Charged, please take a look at our Patreon page:https://www.patreon.com/FullyChargedShowIf you like this episode, you'll love our fancy website, which includes the 'A-Z of Everything'....https://fullycharged.show",PT20M57S,12/11/19,12/11/19,24421,fullychargedshow,/channel/UCzz4CoEgSgWNs9ZAvRMhW2A,UCzz4CoEgSgWNs9ZAvRMhW2A,19,gP51JjnWvLo

"The Epic of Gilgamesh, Lecture by Andrew George",Education,1313911,"11,204","1,110","Andrew George, Professor of Babylonian, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of LondonThe Epic of Gilgamesh is a 4,000-year-old Mesopotamian poem about a hero who embarks on an arduous quest to find the secret of immortality. Preserved on clay tablets in cuneiform script, it is generally considered to be the earliest great work of literature to survive from the ancient world. In this illustrated lecture, Andrew George, author of a prize-winning translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh, explores four themes related to this Babylonian masterpiece: the archaeology of the poem’s recovery, the reconstruction of its text, the story it tells, and its messages about life and death.Presented in collaboration with the Departments of Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations and Comparative Literature, with the support of the Provostial Fund for the Arts and Humanities, Harvard University",PT88M46S,1/30/17,1/30/17,311231,Harvard Semitic Museum,/channel/UC-GdDwqCXXeg_AF1XgN6DwA,UC-GdDwqCXXeg_AF1XgN6DwA,20,Rd7MrGy_tEg

It deals with the division of the empire by Theodosius I and the rule of his successors Honorius and Arcadius. Honorius' reign saw Britannia leave the empire and the first sack of Rome in about 800 years. The borders of the empire continued to weaken under his successors in the west as the East held on in the face of barbarian groups like the Huns or the Vandals. In the end, the Western Roman Empire would disappear in 476 ushering in a new age of smaller kingdoms in Europe.Recommended books:Chris Wickham - The Inheritance of Rome.

The nature of the finds and their volume suggests that these high up palces thought to be impassable were actually highways over which people and goods were being transported from the hinterland to the coastal settlements that connected them with a trading network that stretched out across the North Sea to Anglo-Saxon England and the Carolingian Empire as well as the Baltic and beyond.Further Reading:News Article Mentioned:https://news.artnet.com/art-world/mel...Article on Ice Patch Reindeer Hunting In Norway:https://royalsocietypublishing.org/do...

The Viking History of York,Education,58774,"1,791",18,"The city of York in the north of England was home to a seat of Scandinavian rule built off the back of viking raids and the initial conquest of the Danelaw by the brothers Halfdan with the Wide Embrace, Ivar the Boneless and Ubba the Duke of the Frisians with the Great Heathen Army. From then on until the middle of the 11th century it served as a focal point for Norse activity in Britain, often being connected to the Hiberno-Norse kingdoms in Ireland like Dublin, and being a key city to the likes of Olaf Guthfrithsson, Eric Bloodaxe and Harald Hardrada before being fully absorbed into Norman England for good after the 1080's. It never lost it's Scandinavian heritage however, as can be seen on the city's streetnames, the local dialects and of course the rich treasure trove of archaeological discoveries found at the Coppergate dig which can still be seen in Jorvik Museum today.

Victor Davis Hanson on “The Case For Trump”,News & Politics,2549122,"29,103","2,143","Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump’s “personal authenticity” during the campaign and how the media has a “historical amnesia” of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump’s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn’t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California’s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that’s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

Thomas Sowell on the Myths of Economic Inequality,News & Politics,1133183,"26,994",872,"Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master’s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell’s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell’s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

In her book The Diversity Delusion, Heather Mac Donald argues that the focus on race and gender diversity is harming society.

They discuss the collapse of free-speech ideals on college campuses in the United States and how the dedication to diversity doesn’t extend to a diversity of thought. Mac Donald also breaks down issues of gender and racial equality. She talks about how affirmative action has not had the impact that was intended and has in fact made attending college more difficult for minorities who are accepted to schools they are not ready for. She also goes on to analyze rape culture on college campuses and posits her theories as to why discussions of sexual violence have become more prevalent now than in the past.

SpaceX Crew Dragon vs Boeing Starliner Explained,Science & Technology,304413,"6,903",270,"Check out my new shirts: ineedmore.space/shopThe advantages and disadvantages of Crew Dragon and Starliner have been sparred over for many years. In this video, I hope to settle the up and downsides of each spacecraft, and hopefully let you all decide which one you'd want a seat on. Although, I'm beginning to think I know which one you will prefer already!Dragon 2 is a class of reusable spacecraft developed and manufactured by U.S. aerospace manufacturer SpaceX, intended as the successor to the Dragon cargo spacecraft. The spacecraft launches atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket and returns via ocean splashdown. When compared to Dragon, Crew Dragon has larger windows, new flight computers and avionics, redesigned solar arrays, and a modified outer mold line.The spacecraft has two planned variants – Crew Dragon, a human-rated capsule capable of carrying up to seven astronauts, and Cargo Dragon, an updated replacement for the original Dragon. Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated launch escape system in a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two SuperDraco engines each.The Boeing Starliner (CST-100 - Crew Space Transportation-100) is a crew capsule manufactured by Boeing as its participation in NASA's Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program. Its primary purpose is to transport crew to the International Space Station (ISS) and to private space stations such as the proposed Bigelow Aerospace Commercial Space Station.The capsule has a diameter of 4.56 m,  which is slightly larger than the Apollo command module and smaller than the Orion capsule. The Boeing Starliner holds a crew of up to seven people and is being designed to be able to remain in-orbit for up to seven months with the reusability of up to ten missions. It is designed to be compatible with four launch vehicles: Atlas V, Delta IV, Falcon 9, and Vulcan.Host & Producer: TJ Cooney http://twitter.com/TJ_CooneyWriter and Researcher: Ishan Patil: https://twitter.com/_ishanspatilEditor: Jenny ChoLeave future episode ideas in the comments below!",PT19M41S,3/2/20,3/2/20,12413,I Need More Space,/channel/UCLr2Dn-wAtO8jxrj8MZ58cg,UCLr2Dn-wAtO8jxrj8MZ58cg,20,rbBY1W7aRp0

Global Warming: Fact or Fiction? Featuring Physicists Willie Soon and Elliott Bloom,Education,565759,"13,695",927,"Is global warming real? Have any such predictions been established scientifically? Would massive “carbon” taxes and other controls put America and the world—especially the poor—at great risk?At this special event, geoscientist and astrophysicist Willie Soon separates fact from fiction in the global warming debate. He explains why the forecasts from CO2 climate models have been so wrong—and why solar influences on clouds, oceans, and wind drive climate change, not CO2 emissions. Stanford University physicist Elliott Bloom then comments.“The whole point of science is to question accepted dogmas. For that reason, I respect Willie Soon as a good scientist and a courageous citizen.”—Freeman J. Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics, Institute for Advanced Study; Templeton Prize Laureate“I am writing to express my deep admiration and respect for Dr. Willie Soon, a fine astrophysicist and human being.... As Willie has shown in many ways, observational facts do not fit the CO2 dogma, and an enormous amount of evidence points to the Sun as a much more important driver of climate.... Willie was right—whatever the cause of changing temperature, the main driver cannot be the concentration of atmospheric CO2.”—William Happer, Chairman, Presidential Committee on Climate Security; Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics Emeritus, Princeton University; Member, National Academy of SciencesWillie Soon is a geophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He received his Ph.D. (with distinction) in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California, and he has been Astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory; Senior Scientist at the George C. Marshall Institute; Senior Visiting Fellow at the State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science at Xiamen University; and Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Putra Malaysia.

Why Didn't Anyone Copy the Roman Army? - The Imitation Legions DOCUMENTARY,Education,1364254,"33,378","1,254","Unlock an arsenal of free battle supplies in Conqueror's Blade! http://bit.ly/3bVIBCTSponsored by MY.GAMESThe Roman army is remembered today as one of the most effective fighting forces in history. This raises the question: if the Roman army was so powerful, why didn’t anyone copy the Roman army? To answer this question, we will first dissect the specimen on the Roman legions. This will allow us to understand what are the key features worth copying. We will then be able to discuss what would be required to achieve these same features and to what extent others succeeded in creating their very own imitation legions.In this history documentary we cover the Roman Soldier, the Roman Unit, and the Roman Army.

But with the region crosshatched by important shipping lanes, the undersea bed replete with oil and gas, and the marine life furnishing vast fishing grounds, the surrounding waters are simmering with tension. China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei all lay claim to a portion of the territory, in a little-known diplomatic contest that for decades has regularly brought the area to the brink of war, and put it firmly off-limits to Western media. ""China is doing a lot of things besides bullying our fishermen and small navies"", explains the mayor as he points out a Chinese development on a small atoll known as 'Mischief Reef'.

Darius I and The Greatest Lie in History,Education,848072,"21,873",656,"In our new animated historical documentary we will talk about the king of the Achaemenid Empire Darius I and his ascension to the throne. Assassination, intrigue and cover-ups, what more could we want in a story about Imperial succession? The First Persian Empire was one of the greatest and most labyrinthine empires that ever existed. An expertly organised economy, a relatively tolerant and lenient provincial system, along with other groundbreaking advances in human civilisation was combined with some of the most scandalous and bloody court politics in the history of the world. Much of ancient Persia’s prominence and prosperity was made possible by one man, perhaps the most competent ruler Persia ever produced - Darius I, or ‘the Great’. How this figure came to power is not a well known story, but it is one of the most obscure and colourful tales we can gather from the ancient sources. Welcome to our video on Darius the Great and how he rose to become the King of Kings.

50 years off-grid: architect-maker paradise amid NorCal redwoods,Howto & Style,1465176,"49,642",546,"In 1968, Charles Bello and his wife, Vanna Rae, moved onto 240 acres of redwood forest looking to live a simpler life off the land. They had spent their savings to purchase the land so they got to work building their home themselves. Their first structure was a panelized A-frame that they erected in 5 days (with help from a couple family members). Total cost was $2,800.The property is a half-hour drive down a dirt road and it was bare land when they arrived so Charles and Vanna Rae built their own infrastructure: roads, bridges and went decades without refrigeration nor phone (they eventually installed PV panels and cabling for phone lines). After 15 years in the A-frame, they built a cabin in the woods and there they lived for a decade until the trees began to block out their views. In 1991 Charles (who once apprenticed under famed architect Richard Neutra) designed the Parabolic Glass House. With a curvilinear wood roof and two curved walls of windows, the home feels enveloped in trees.Charles and Vanna Rae built it for $8,500 with timber they milled themselves, using salvaged materials for everything from doorknobs to stoves. The couple relied on photovoltaics, solar thermal and gas for power and a dug-in greenhouse attached to the home provided much of their food. By canning and preserving, they could go for months without going to a grocery store. Their two boys were homeschooled. The couple supported themselves selling Christmas trees.Nearly all the old growth trees on the property were logged in the early 20th century, but Charles has spent the past half century restoring the land. He and his wife set up the Redwood Forest Institute in 1997 to manage and preserve the forest. He has carefully selected 1,000 trees to be preserved for 2 millenia as the next generation of old growth.Now, 87 years old and a widower, Charles is determined to find successors; he hopes to find three couples who want to settle on the property (currently worth about 4-6 million dollars) in exchange for continuing as stewards of the land. He is currently building glamping guest houses that he hopes will help fund the enterprise. His website now advertises “seeking caretaker ASAP”, someone “wanting to get away from it all and live a more simple down to earth lifestyle”.http://savetrees.org/seeking_caretake...",PT47M29S,4/26/20,4/26/20,113421,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,2qcsWajivnI
Underground dome house of the family who led geese to fly home,Autos & Vehicles,2633675,"58,048","1,704","Paula and Bill Lishman spent many winters in a poorly-insulated A frame cabin before realizing they needed to go underground to use the earth’s energy to stay warm, so they knocked the top off a hill, dropped in ferro-cement domes and covered it up again with dirt. Thanks to skylights cut into every dome and the white-powdered marble that covers the interior, their earth-sheltered home is naturally well-lit despite being below the frost line. Fifteen feet below ground, the soil temperature remains about equal to the annual average temperature of the area’s surface air so earth-sheltered homes use sod’s constant temperature to stay warmer in winter and cooler in summer.Bill Lishman believed in rethinking not just the conventional home, but also how we live. He reimagined his home’s refrigerator by building a round appliance that pops up out of the countertop so the heavier cool air stays inside when opened (via compressed air).In 1986, Bill Lishman began training Canada Geese to follow his ultralight aircraft and to ""teach"" the birds migration routes to avoid a threatened extinction. His work on ""Operation Migration"" brought him popular recognition with the 1996 movie Fly Away Home starring Jeff Daniels.Paula Lishman also believes in rethinking convention. In 1979 she began her fashion label reinventing the fur trade by using spun fur to knit her clothing.http://williamlishman.com/http://www.paulalishman.comhttps://faircompanies.com/videos/unde...",PT23M33S,8/17/19,8/17/19,244314,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,RoGuvvzHY1A

Boston Dynamics is an engineering and robotics design company that is best known for the development of BigDog, a quadruped robot designed for the U.S. military with funding from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and DI-Guy, software for realistic human simulation. Early in the company's history, it worked with the American Systems Corporation under a contract from the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) to replace naval training videos for aircraft launch operations with interactive 3D computer simulations featuring DI-Guy characters. Marc Raibert is the company's president and project manager. He spun the company off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992. On 13 December 2013, the company was acquired by Google X, where it will be managed by Andy Rubin. Immediately before the acquisition, Boston Dynamics transferred their DI-Guy software product line to VT MÄK, a simulation software vendor based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Discover the History of English,Education,1025032,"34,344",516,"Did you know that the English word ""human"" has a Latin origin? And did you know that the word ""people"" actually comes from French? Today, hundreds of millions of people speak English either as their first or second language. But hundreds of years ago, the English language that we know today did not exist. It has been evolving through the centuries and continues to do so now. In this lesson, I will teach you the history of invasions, migrations, and other influences that have helped to shape English as we know it. You will also discover English words that have origins in Latin, French, and other languages. Don't miss this fascinating lesson!http://www.engvid.com/discover-the-hi...TRANSCRIPTHello. I'm Gill from engVid, and today... As you know, I usually teach an aspect of the English language, but today, we're going to be looking at the English language from a different perspective, a different angle, and looking at the history of the language and how it has developed, because the English language hasn't always been the way it is today. It's developed over hundreds and hundreds of years.Now, today, hundreds of millions of people speak English all over the world, whether it's their first language or their second language, or just one of the foreign languages that they speak and learn at school, and so on. So, hundreds of millions of people speak English and learn English. But hundreds of years ago, the English language that we know today didn't really exist. It sort of got put together gradually by different historical events. So we're going to go back in history now, and have a look at a timeline.I don't know if you've seen a timeline before, but it is literally the time, the years going from left to right, like you get on a graph if you've done graphs, and the time goes across along the line. So the different developments that happened can be shown on that line. So we're starting here in 55 BC, hundreds of years ago, and we're coming up to... Well, beyond. We have 1066, here, but because I ran out of space on the board, the time went on for such a long time, I couldn't get all the centuries in, but I will still tell you about them. Okay. But these are the very interesting parts, which are on the board.So, 55 BC, the Roman invasion of Britain, of the U.K., where we are at the moment. So, you've heard of the Roman Empire with Julius Caesar and all the other Caesars, the Roman Empire that spread in different directions, and Britain is one of the directions they spread in. They came here, and stayed for a while, and built some nice buildings, and they built a wall that goes across between Scotland and England, called Hadrian's Wall, because the Emperor at the time was called Hadrian. So, anyway, when they came and stayed for some time, they brought their language with them, the Latin language. Okay? And the Latin language, it's called a dead language today, but it has influenced so many other languages, especially in Southern Europe, so languages like Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, they all come from Latin. So, in this country, in the English language, we have had the Latin influence at different times. So, the Romans brought their Latin language with them. Okay? So that influenced the way people were speaking to each other as time went on. And the natives of this country started learning Latin words, and it became integrated into the language.Okay, so let's have a look at some of the words that we use today that were influenced or that came from Latin words. Right? And we have this pie chart, here, which you may know if you've been studying things for IELTS and the writing task. A pie chart... So, the whole circle represents 100%. So if you're thinking of all the words in the English language at the moment, Latin, the Latin words that came from... Partly from the Roman invasion, we have 29% of the words in the English language have come from a Latin origin, from a source, Latin source. Okay. So here are just a few of very words that we use every day, really. Words like: ""human"", ""animal"", ""dental"" to do with the teeth, ""decimal"" which is to do with the fingers because we have 10 fingers, ""decimal"", and ""digital"", also fingers, ""factory"" where things are made, manufacture, ""library"" where you read books, ""libre"" meaning book, ""library"", the building where the books are kept, ""manual"" to do with if you do things with your hand it comes from the Latin word for ""hand"", ""manual"". ""Lunar"" to do with the moon, because the Latin word for the moon was ""luna"", ""luna"". And ""solar"" to do with the sun, again, because the Latin word was like that, ""solar"". ""Military"", anything to do with soldiers because the Latin Roman Empire soldiers were... That was the word that was used for ""soldiers"". ""Melees"" I think. And we also get our ""mile"", the distance, the mile from that, because that was the distance that they would march, I think, before they had a rest or something like that.",PT21M37S,4/13/16,4/13/16,31221,Learn English with Gill (engVid),/channel/UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,19,aEH2GkuRIHs
The British Royal Family: Everything you need to know,Education,176001,"4,999",98,"Interested in the UK and the British Royal Family? Don't know who all these dukes and duchesses are? In this lesson, I'll explain how the British monarchy works. You'll learn about the members and titles of the royal family, the history of monarchy in the UK, and how our constitutional monarchy works. I'll answer questions like: What is the queen's job? Why is there no king right now, even though Queen Elizabeth II has a husband? Who will inherit the throne?... and more. Watch this lesson to understand the royal family and the culture of monarchy in the UK.TAKE THIS QUIZ TO TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE: https://www.engvid.com/british-royal-...TRANSCRIPT Hello. I'm Gill at engVid, and today's lesson is all about the British Royal Family. Okay, so if you probably see items in the news about our royal family, you'll have seen the queen, Queen Elizabeth; maybe her husband, Prince Philip; but they're a big family, and also not all countries have a royal family so I've just put this lesson together with a bit of information to tell you a little bit more about them. Okay, right, so the British Royal Family are also known as the House of Windsor, because Windsor is their name, which comes from Windsor. This place here, Windsor Castle is one of their homes. So years ago they decided to use the name Windsor.So, some people like the royal family, admire them. They think of them as kind of celebrities, just like film stars, and sports celebrities. They're reported in the newspapers in a similar way. You get gossip about them. In some newspapers who like to write a lot of gossip, if they've heard something, it may not be accurate, but they've heard a story about some member of the royal family, and they print the story. They might have a photograph to go with it. So they're always in the news, the royal family, for one reason or another, either a good reason or a bad reason. Pretty much every day you can hear something about the royal family or read something in the newspaper. So, some people do like them, and even, you know, think of them as celebrities, and maybe give too much time and thought to them.But then at the other extreme, some people dislike them because they're thinking of the fact that they spend a lot of money, they have all these buildings which are expensive to look after, people say: ""What work do they do?"" They don't seem to do any work, so why should they live such rich lives if they don't do anything? But, of course, a lot of the royal family do things all the time. They're not working for money always, sometimes they do that as well, they have jobs some of them with a salary, but some of them, they may not be working and being paid for it, but they're doing kind of diplomatic work, they're meeting visitors from other countries, they're being kind of ambassadors, that sort of thing. So they keep busy, and they're patrons of charities and they go to events, and they give their support to things and so on. So, a lot of the royal family do keep quite busy trying to live useful lives, and so I think if they didn't do that there would be a lot more sort of criticism of them. But because you can't see that they're doing things, working hard, that stops a lot of people from criticizing and saying we shouldn't have a royal family. Some people are called Republicans, and they say we should have a president instead of a queen or a king. We should have a president and a prime minister instead of a queen and a prime minister. So there are Republicans around and have been for more than a hundred years, people who wanted to get rid of the royal family, but it hasn't happened yet.Okay, so the kind of system we have in the UK, it's called a constitutional monarchy. The ""monarchy"" part is to do with the royal family, with the queen. The monarch, so the word ""monarch"" means king or queen. The ""constitutional"" part is to do with politics, and the government, and parliament. So what happens, really, is the government, the MPs, the ministers in parliament, they make the decisions. The government makes the decisions. And if they have a new piece of, an act of parliament, a new law, for example, the queen just has to sign it. If it's been democratically decided already by the politicians that this will become law, the queen can't just say: ""No, I don't like that. I'm not going to sign it."" She just has to sign it because it's gone through a democratic process. So that's why it's a constitutional monarchy. It's the monarch or king or queen governed by the parliament, by the politicians. Okay.So, let's have a look at some of the vocabulary which is fairly simple most of it. So a king or queen is the monarch, the head of state if you like. Usually any children they have will be prince or princess, so prince for male, princess of female. There are some other titles used as well, which are sort of high aristocratic titles. Duke for the male, duchess for the female.",PT28M52S,9/30/17,9/30/17,312213,Learn English with Gill (engVid),/channel/UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,19,jSDoxNzFMZw
"Learn British accents and dialects – Cockney, RP, Northern, and more!",Education,4771287,"145,782","2,721","Did you know that there are over 30 different English accents in England alone? And that's not all. Would you believe there are over a hundred different English dialects accross the world? In this lesson, I will tell you about some common British accents you might hear. You'll hear examples of Cockney, RP, Estuary, Northern, Scottish, Welsh, and many more accents. Don't miss this opportunity to add some spice to your English pronunciation and comprehension! Take the quiz at http://www.engvid.com/learn-british-a...TRANSCRIPTHi. I'm Gill at www.engvid.com, and today's lesson is about accents in the U.K. So, U.K. accents and also dialects. Okay, so what's the difference between an accent and a dialect? Right. Well, an accent, as you know, is to do with pronunciation, how you pronounce the word. Dialect is when you have a word that only people in a certain area of the country use; it's not a national word, it's a local word that maybe people from other parts of the country, they won't even know what it means, so that's dialect. Okay. So, let's just have a look through some of the accents that we have in the U.K.The one that you're probably learning as you're learning to pronounce English words is RP. ""RP"" stands for ""Received Pronunciation"". It's a slightly strange term. ""Received"" where do you receive it from? Well, maybe you receive it from your teacher. This is how to say this word. It's a slightly strange expression, but RP, it's usually referred to by the initials. And it's the kind of accent you will hear if you're watching BBC Television programs or listening to BBC Radio. Not everybody on the BBC speaks with an RP accent. The news readers tend to be RP speakers, but not always. But the strange thing is that in this country, only a very small percentage of people do speak with this accent. Apparently, just 3%, but they tend to be people in positions of power, authority, responsibility. They probably earn a lot of money. They live in big houses. You know the idea. So, people like the Prime Minster, at the moment David Cameron, he went to a private school, he went to university, Oxford, so people who have been to Oxford and Cambridge Universities often speak in RP, even if they didn't speak in RP before they went to Oxford or Cambridge, they often change their accent while they are there because of the big influence of their surroundings and the people that they're meeting. So that's RP. It's a very clear accent. So, it's probably a good idea to either learn to speak English with an RP accent, or you may be learning with an American accent, a Canadian accent, all of those accents are very clear. Okay. And being clear is the most important thing.Okay, so moving on. RP, as I should have said, is mostly in the south of the country; London and the south. So, also ""Cockney"" and ""Estuary English"" are in the south. Okay. So, Cockney is the local London accent, and it tends to spread further out to places like Kent, Essex, other places like that. Surrey. There's a newer version of Cockney called ""Estuary English"". If you think an estuary is connected to a river, so the River Thames which flows across the country, goes quite a long way west. So anyone living along the estuary, near the river can possibly have this accent as well.So, just to give you some examples, then, of the Cockney accent, there are different features. So, one example is the ""th"" sound, as you know to make a ""th"" sound, some of you may find it difficult anyway, ""the"", when you put your tongue through your teeth, ""the"", but a Cockney person may not use the ""the"", they will use an ""f"" sound or a ""v"" sound instead, so the word ""think"", ""I think"", they would say would say instead of: ""think"", they would say it like that: ""fink"", ""fink"", and the top teeth are on the bottom lip, ""think"". And words like ""with"" that end with the ""th"", instead of ""with"", it will be ""wiv"", ""wiv"", ""wiv"". ""Are you coming wiv me?"" So that is one of the things that happens with the Cockney accent.Words like ""together"" would be ""togever"". Okay? The number ""three"", t-h-r-e-e is often pronounced ""free"": ""We have free people coming to dinner. Free people."" So, there can be confusion there, because we have the word ""free"", which has a meaning in itself, ""free"", but if you actually mean ""three"", the number three, there can be some confusion. So don't get confused by ""free people"". -""Oh, they're free? They're free to come?"" -""No, there are three of them. Three people who are free to come."" Ah, okay.",PT24M6S,4/29/16,4/29/16,312112,Learn English with Gill (engVid),/channel/UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,19,nDdRHWHzwR4

What really happens when you Die • End-of-life-phenomena | An Interview with Peter Fenwick,Education,2677649,"36,225","2,259","Peter Fenwick (born 25 May 1935) is a neuropsychiatrist and neurophysiologist who is known for his pioneering studies of end-of-life phenomena.In this interview he talks about near-death-experiences (NDE), death-bed-visitors and how we can achieve a good death.NDE research is at the cutting edge of consciousness research and offers a convincing model for the understanding of what happens when we die. Peter Fenwick describes the different transitional phases of the dying process and highlights the importance of letting go at the end of ones life.He offers fascinating insights into common phenomena at the end of life, such as premonitions, seeing a light, death-bed-visions and coincidences. In his opinion everybody should know about death and the dying process, because it is a normal part of living.Contents:00:08 What is a neuropsychiatrist?00:46 What does your daily work involve?02:14 In broad terms, what can we learn from these scans?03:18 How did you get involved with near-death experiences?04:18 How did you go about studying these phenomena? 07:35 Did you get the whole spectrum of near-death experiences?09:00 Is that dependent on your worldview, on your background?09:19 What do you think is the value of NDE research?10:25 Do you think that near-death experiences provide some kind of proof that consciousness can exist without a brain?15:33 Can you tell us about  the end-of-life phenomena which you describe in your book?22:53 So there are visitors and spiritual beings.

Arête Sud-Ouest, Arête du Lion... Alpes Pennines... Breuil-Cervinia, Refuge Carrel, Sommet aller retour... Merci à Paul Millet et à Baptiste Galli...Il y a 150 ans... Le 10 juillet 1865, l'alpiniste Edward Whymper rencontre le valtournain Jean-Antoine Carrel, guide italien qui rêve lui aussi de réussir la première ascension mais par l'arête italienne, les deux hommes ayant déjà tenté son ascension, sans succès. Wymper veut engager Carrel mais ce dernier refuse car il est déjà engagé dans ce projet avec le club alpin. Le 12 juillet, Wymper constate que la cordée de Carrel a déjà entamé l'ascension, si bien qu'il bouleverse ses plans et décide de tenter la sienne à partir de Zermatt, côté suisse du Cervin, par l'arête du Hörnli (arête nord-est) qui est réputée plus difficile mais qui se révélera plus facile finalement. Il forme alors sa cordée avec Lord Francis Douglas (jeune aristocrate anglais qui finance l'expédition), Peter Taugwalder fils et Peter Taugwalder père, paysans qui complètent leurs revenus en jouant les guides. Arrivés à l'hôtel du Mont-Rose, ils rencontrent le révérend Charles Hudson et son jeune et très inexpérimenté compagnon Douglas Robert Hadow (en) qui ont engagé le guide chamoniard Michel Croz (réputé pour son sens de l'itinéraire) pour eux aussi tenter cette première ascension. Les deux cordées britanniques décident alors d'unir leurs forces pour essayer de gravir ensemble l'arête du Hörnli et partent de Zermatt le 13 juillet pour la redoutable cime. Le 14 juillet, la cordée des sept hommes atteint le sommet vers 13 h 40, Wymper et Croz s'étant désencordés dans la dernière pente pour arriver premier et deuxième...Le 17 juillet 1865, trois jours à peine après la première ascension, la cordée italienne menée par Jean-Antoine Carrel, comprenant Jean-Baptiste Bich, l'abbé Amé Gorret et Jean-Augustin Meynet, réalise la première ascension du Cervin par l'arête du Lion (arête sud-ouest), plus difficile que l'arête du Hörnli...https://www.tvmountain.com",PT19M18S,9/13/15,9/13/15,24133,Matterhorn,/results?search_query=Matterhorn&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKMmV5NXkyZ3pqMGNSU1ZqbHJJeEZKcGc%253D,UCuoT1bfbPqZT_1ULPcLutaQ,19,hLjHOJOrfKU

New research and technologies have brought us closer than ever to an answer - only a few decades in the eyes of some NASA scientists.The search has led to new discoveries that will blow your mind wide open and give a profound new perspective on human life. The deeper we look, the deeper we see into nature's imagination, and the more we learn about ourselves.  I hope stewing on these thoughts tickles your brain as deeply as it does mine.

TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A Journey to the End of Time (4K),Music,34189916,"1,438,535","38,050","Support my work on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/melodysheep  |  Get the soundtrack: https://bit.ly/2HKl9fi  |   How's it all gonna end?  This experience takes us on a journey to the end of time, trillions of years into the future, to discover what the fate of our planet and our universe may ultimately be. We start in 2019 and travel exponentially through time, witnessing the future of Earth, the death of the sun, the end of all stars, proton decay, zombie galaxies, possible future civilizations, exploding black holes, the effects of dark energy, alternate universes, the final fate of the cosmos - to name a few.This is a picture of the future as painted by modern science - a picture that will surely evolve over time as we dig for more clues to how our story will unfold. Much of the science is very recent - and new puzzle pieces are still waiting to be found.To me, this overhead view of time gives a profound perspective - that we are living inside the hot flash of the Big Bang, the perfect moment to soak in the sights and sounds of a universe in its glory days, before it all fades away.  Although the end will eventually come, we have a practical infinity of time to play with if we play our cards right. The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species.

The Battle of Midway 1942: Told from the Japanese Perspective (1/2),Education,7066581,"102,349","3,177","(Animated Battle Map) This is part one of a planned two-part video covering Operation MI. As you can see I spent a considerable amount of time covering Nagumo’s Dilemma. To me it's one of most striking examples of how tough it can be for a commander to make a decision based on the information at hand. I found that to be the most interesting aspect of the battle. I don’t have a Patreon but if you want to show appreciation for my work feel free to donate. » patreon -https://www.paypal.me/montemayorytcha...Corrections: ""Strength"" , ""Auxiliary"", and ""unknown"" are misspelled in the video. At 22:55 I should have stated “North of Midway” instead of Northeast of Midway. The illustration shows a 10 degree 240 nm from midway location. Not so Northeast as I audibly stated.At 23:43 I should have stated 79 aircraft instead of 78 and I should have displayed 35 instead of 34 torpedo bombers. the “mistake” came about because sources still differ on whether there were 27 or 26 Carrier attack planes (Kates). If it was 27 it would have been 79 Planes. if it was 26 it would have been 78. During the recording I somehow mixed up the numbers. Additional Notes:notice that the carriers started off the battle in a box formation. This provided further mutual support for their rather weak AA fire. however, due to the incessant air attacks from VT-8, VT-6 and VT-3, the carriers were never able to reform in a box formation, instead they were in a ragged line which further worsened their AA capabilities. -----------------------------------------Spoiler Below regarding Nagumo's Dilemma---------------------------------------------So what was the answer to Nagumo’s Dilemma?“Taking all together, and admittedly operating with the benefit of hindsight, the “right” answer to Nagumo’s conundrum probably should have emphasized maneuver, offensive speed in preference to mass, and passive damage control. With fifteen minutes in which to act, he didn’t really have time to implement anything terribly fancy. But he could have helped himself immensely by immediately spotting every strike airplane in his hangars, whether they were armed or not, and launching them at the Americans. The sixty-four armed aircraft he had in had were perfectly capable of doing enormous damage to his enemy. And by emptying his hangars, he removed the single greatest danger to his carriers --- the presence of fueled and armed aircraft within them.” Parshall, Jonathan B.; Tully, Anthony P.: Shattered Sword.

No wonder people are wondering what is reality and what is fake.

An atmosphere where hurricanes and tornados are spawned, and below that a realm of volcanos and earthquakes.Starting just before New Year's Day, on Boxing Day 2004, the year 2005 was the most disastrous on record, with hundreds of billions of pounds of losses and more than half a million deaths.  This programme covers the litany of planetary catastrophes, from the extraordinary Boxing Day killer tsunami in the Indian Ocean, through the great Kashmir earthquake to Hurricane Katrina and the devastation it wrought on New Orleans, along with UK events, such as the Birmingham tornado, which reached the highest tornado category, yet miraculously killed no-one.2005 saw an onslaught of epic-scale climate and geological events across the world, all caught on camera in the most spectacular fashion by professionals and amateurs alike.  Using eye-witness footage, interviews with survivors and rescuers and analysis from geological and weather specialists, this documentary charts the incredible natural events of a year where almost every month was affected by a natural disaster.At that time it was the hottest year on record, and the stormiest, people on every continent were affected in some way by the year’s disasters.  World leading scientists and climatologists speculate whether the events have been triggered by a real shift in the earth's climatic systems.Some of the natural disasters covered in this documentary :Indian Ocean Earthquake and Asian TsunamiThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was an undersea megathrust earthquake that occurred on 26th December with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia.  The earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 metres high.Maharashtra FloodsThe 2005 Maharashtra floods refers to the flooding of many parts of the Indian state of Maharashtra including large areas of the metropolis Mumbai a city located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, on the western coast of India, in which at least 5,000 people died.Birmingham TornadoThe Birmingham tornado was one of the strongest tornadoes recorded in the United Kingdom in nearly 30 years, occurring on 28th July 2005 in the suburbs of Birmingham.  The tornado uprooted an estimated 1,000 trees, removed the roofs of buildings, picked up and deposited cars and caused other damage during its short existence.European FloodsThe 2005 European floods hit mainly Romania, Switzerland, Austria and Germany, as well as several other countries in Central Europe and Eastern Europe during August.  The disaster came at a time when Portugal was suffering from intense forest fires which left 15 dead.Hurricane KatrinaHurricane Katrina was the deadliest and most destructive Atlantic tropical cyclone of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.  It is the costliest natural disaster, as well as one of the deadliest hurricanes, in the history of the United States.  At least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods.  The most significant number of deaths occurred in New Orleans, Louisiana, which flooded as the levee system catastrophically failed.Kashmir EarthquakeThe Kashmir earthquake occurred on 8th October 2005 and was centred in the Pakistan administered Kashmir near the city of Muzaffarabad, and also affected the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.  It registered a moment magnitude of 7.6.  The government of Pakistan's official death toll was 75,000.  The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust, coupled with poor construction.",PT101M5S,2/18/15,2/18/15,11114,Naked Science,/channel/UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,20,Sx6vuSr9l34

In spring 2003, strange things began happening in America's most famous national park.  The tallest geyser in the world, which can go 50 years without erupting, burst into life.  Spraying columns of superheated water, 100s of feet into the air.  There were new cracks in the ground, the ground heated up to the point where the National Park Service had to close some trails.  Not long after, a group of bison collapsed and died, victims of poisonous fumes from below the ground.  Satellite pictures revealed that something ominous was happening beneath the earth.  On the internet, unfounded rumours spread that a super volcano, an eruption so large, that it only occurs on average every 700,000 years, was about to blow.  These things happen, you can look at the earth and see the scars.  They happen, and they're going to happen again.A million times more powerful than Hiroshima, super volcanoes are real events.  Over 20 have been recorded in the history of the earth and over half of these happened in the USA.  For the last 30 years scientists have been investigating where the next super volcano could erupt.  Their research has revealed that an active super volcano exists under Yellowstone National Park.  Naked Science follows these scientists and investigates the vital question, if the Yellowstone Caldera erupted today, could we survive?  This documentary includes a Yellowstone timeline of past eruptions, how Yellowstone would affect the world, and what impact will it be for the United States.",PT49M52S,6/29/13,6/29/13,11213,Naked Science,/channel/UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,20,G1pa6afh8o4

The eruption was so loud that the sound was heard over a twelfth of the Earth’s surface, the shockwaves reverberated around the entire planet, seven times.  This explosion also caused giant tsunami, the largest of them twice the height of those of 2004.  These enormous waves wiped out 165 Indonesian towns and villages killing over 36,000 people.  Within hours news of the disaster was transmitted around the globe, and scientists of the time struggled to comprehend the geological forces that caused the tragedy.Indonesia has so many volcanoes and earthquakes because of its geographical position.  The archipelago that starts in Northern Sumatra stretches over 3,000 miles south.  It has been created by the forces where two of the tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s surface, meet.  The ocean floor of the Indo-Australian Plate and the Asian landmass of the Burma Plate are in collision.  As they push against each other the heavier ocean floor is forced underneath the lighter continental rock.  Krakatoa lies directly above this subduction zone.This film reconstructs the true stories of survivors from their accounts and diaries, to piece together what happened in the months leading up to the most famous eruption of all time.",PT85M35S,4/22/15,4/22/15,112132,Naked Science,/channel/UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,19,MrEIT66oPqU

Gentle giants of the Cambrian,Science & Technology,639562,"4,491",157,"More than 500 million years ago in the Cambrian period there was an explosion of animal life. The top predators were from a group called the Anomalocarids, the largest animals of their day. But now, a new fossil suggests that not all the Anomalocarids were the fearsome killing machines scientists once thought. At least one, it seems, evolved into a gentle giant.Read the paper: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/...Cambrian animations: http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/Sign up for the Nature Briefing: An essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, free in your inbox every weekday. https://go.nature.com/371OcVF",PT5M40S,3/26/14,3/26/14,211342,nature video,/channel/UC7c8mE90qCtu11z47U0KErg,UC7c8mE90qCtu11z47U0KErg,20,3aLd8NN0YtY

"1177 BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Eric Cline, PhD)",Science & Technology,4057524,"46,880","2,569","From about 1500 BC to 1200 BC, the Mediterranean region played host to a complex cosmopolitan and globalized world-system. It may have been this very internationalism that contributed to the apocalyptic disaster that ended the Bronze Age. When the end came, the civilized and international world of the Mediterranean regions came to a dramatic halt in a vast area stretching from Greece and Italy in the west to Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia in the east. Large empires and small kingdoms collapsed rapidly. With their end came the world’s first recorded Dark Ages. It was not until centuries later that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting the stage for the evolution of Western society as we know it today.  Professor Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University will explore why the Bronze Age came to an end and whether the collapse of those ancient civilizations might hold some warnings for our current society.Considered for a Pulitzer Prize for his recent book 1177 BC, Dr. Eric H. Cline is Professor of Classics and Anthropology and the current Director of the Capitol Archaeological Institute at The George Washington University. He is a National Geographic Explorer, a Fulbright scholar, an NEH Public Scholar, and an award-winning teacher and author. He has degrees in archaeology and ancient history from Dartmouth, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania; in May 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree (honoris causa) from Muhlenberg College.  Dr. Cline is an active field archaeologist with 30 seasons of excavation and survey experience.The views expressed in this video are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Capital Area Skeptics.",PT70M18S,10/11/16,10/11/16,24322,NCASVideo,/channel/UCV62FVLw6MxUvO8XmnhE4Yw,UCV62FVLw6MxUvO8XmnhE4Yw,19,bRcu-ysocX4

Most Dangerous Ways To School | NICARAGUA | Free Documentary,Entertainment,2933802,"31,852","1,496","Every morning, the three sisters Julia, Yulissa and Kenya climb into their dugout in order to row to school. They live on the east coast of Nicaragua, one of the world’s poorest countries, and the youngest of them has just turned five; the oldest is nine. They row across the Rio Escondido. Not only is it one of the largest rivers in the country, it is simultaneously one of the most dangerous routes to school. While they have to watch out for snakes lurking in the trees over the river, the three sisters also struggle against the current and must ensure the dugout does not fill up with water - because it has multiples holes and could sink at any minute.Other classmates do not necessarily have it easier, because they live far from the river, and their journey to school takes them through the deep jungle. One of these classmates is 11-year-old Greyven. His daily trip takes him through the so-called ‘snake field’, in which coral snakes and the infamous boa constrictor reside. On the way to school, the rain drives the snakes from the empty coconuts on the ground; on the way back the afternoon heat, which is over 35 degrees, means that they are lively and belligerent. The daily journey – ashore and to water – to San Mariano’s small village school is an adventure almost unimaginable to us. Every time they undertake this trip, the children expose themselves to life-threatening dangers, all for the chance to have a better future.",PT48M1S,9/18/15,9/18/15,311343,Nicaragua,/results?search_query=Nicaragua&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKelNMX3pnRENFSThSdFJXc1AtV24tc2c%253D,UCijcd0GR0fkxCAZwkiuWqtQ,19,Sd3gvzk3fLs

What is COVID-19? Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-COV2 is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. It is believed that COVID-19 was transmitted from pangolin to humans (current theory).Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death (WHO, 2020). Ninja Nerd Lectures has compiled the most up to date and recent data on COVID-19 as of March 15, 2020. Please follow along with this lecture to understand the origin and zoonosis of COVID-19, the routes of transmission, epidemiology (current as of 3/15/2020), pathophysiology, and diagnostic tests used to identify COVID-19. As new information and research is published we will continue to provide updates on COVID-19 and ensure all of our viewers are kept up to date on the most recent data.

Secrets of Underground London - Original Narration,Education,1751800,"8,856",471,"This Documentary has been uploaded for educational purposes.No copyright infringement is intended.Original programme description:On the surface, London is a buzzing metropolis. But underneath lies secret, hidden worlds, all but forgotten by the millions of people above. These places make up the countless layers of London, and each tells a unique story of the city’s past - successes and failures; victories and tragedies.When the Romans founded settlements along the River Thames during the 1st century AD, they laid down the very first layer of one of the world’s greatest cities. Long buried pieces of the original Roman town still survive to this day – statues, walls, even an entire amphitheatre, where fierce gladiators once fought…and died for glory.London has seen more than its fair share of death over the centuries. The terrible Plague of the 14th century killed more than half of the population in just two years; and the devastating Great Fire of London in 1666 left vast swathes of the city’s timber framed buildings in ashes. These tragic events are forever carved into London’s subterranean landscape – gruesome plague pits filled with thousands of corpses, and eerie mines excavated for the materials to rebuild the city.But the Victorians were the true masters of the underground; from the creation of the first tunnel under a river to the foundation of one of the world’s most iconic public transport systems. While 19th century engineers believed no goal was out of reach, it often meant that the highest price was paid for by workers - many men tragically lost their lives building the wonders of the industrial age.During the German bombing campaign of London during WWII the underground played a role of life or death. Many railway or ‘Tube’ stations were transformed into huge air raid shelters, and top secret bunkers enabled Churchill’s government to fight the war from within the city. The Prime Minister even had a private underground restroom…hidden inside? A direct hotline to the White House! The Underground has always been the perfect place to store precious items; from the deep tunnel storage of priceless works of art during the war, to impenetrable vaults packed with silver. But the British Library stores a truly astonishing collection of nearly 1.5 million items, from modern novels to priceless historical documents, all available at the exact time a visitor wants it, whether they're coming from Notting Hill or Nantucket.In a city as densely packed as this, sometimes the only way for a building to develop is to build down – and that's exactly what the British Museum is doing. Surrounded by 300 year old buildings and containing the wonders of human civilization, any construction work here is a perilous operation. But four new subterranean levels will breathe a new lease of life into this 260 year old institution, paving the way for the next generation.Discover amazing hidden worlds of the past, present and future in Secrets of Underground London.",PT54M55S,8/12/14,8/12/14,312342,Paul Hicks,/channel/UCJiEMRdTTWY8WW_daYWaJIQ,UCJiEMRdTTWY8WW_daYWaJIQ,20,B8iLrVKQ8VA

His latest book is a profound exploration of one of the most troubled: today’s United States. Hedges, author of American Fascists and War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, cites the opioid crisis, the increases in gambling and magical thinking, and the explosion of xenophobia as symptoms of a society that has lost hope. He traces this disillusionment to the twin ills of a de facto corporate coup d’état and a failed democracy. The anger and frustration these have spawned helped bring Trump to power and Hedges issues a passionate call to action to reverse them.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9...Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist who was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years for The New York Times where he served as the Middle East Bureau Chief and Balkan Bureau Chief for the paper.

Response to Globebusters - The Earth Still Isn't Flat,Education,2215361,"68,986","8,768","Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel ""Globebusters"" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth ""model"" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy.

A Reagan Forum with Rich Little — 3/6/2017,Education,143758,"1,270",74,"Please join us for an evening with comedian, actor, artist and entertainment legend Rich Little, who will be here to discuss his new book, Little by Little: People I’ve Known and Been (Publish Date: August 8, 2016), as well as to share stories of his time spent with President Reagan. Tickets to the event are $56 per person and include a buffet dinner in the Air Force One Pavilion following the program. Books must be purchased in the Reagan Library Museum Store to receive signature.Rich Little is a master mimic of more than 200 voices and currently has a Las Vegas Show at the Tropicana Hotel. Rich Little has a voice for every administration including U.S. Presidents: John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, both George Bushes and Barack Obama. Infamous for his skewering of political figures, Little has charmed, amused, intrigued and gotten the best of politicians from here to his native Canada. He entertained at both of Ronald Reagan’s presidential inaugurations and got to know the Reagans very well during that time. President Reagan used to tell Little, “You do me better than I do.”In Little by Little, Rich Little shares his story of how he grew up to become an impersonator. In this gem of a book are insights into the likes of many of the great people he had the privilege and fortune to meet and imitate, shining new light on our beloved stars, including a chapter on Ronald Reagan. This is really not a biography, but more of a humorous glimpse of the people he’s impersonated and some of the funny stories that happened along the way.For more information on the ongoing works of President Reagan's Foundation, please visit http://www.reaganfoundation.orgFor more information on donations, visit https://support.google.com/youtube/?p...",PT64M31S,3/6/17,3/6/17,214441,ReaganFoundation,/channel/UCEJi23qnygQHE5UeLXoV_JQ,UCEJi23qnygQHE5UeLXoV_JQ,20,qkFlVnHVHzI

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.---------That proposition was the subject of a November 5, 2019, debate hosted by the Soho Forum, a monthly debate series sponsored by Reason. Arguing in favor of the resolution was Richard D. Wolff, an economist at the University of Massachusetts and the author, most recently, of Understanding Marxism. Taking the other side was former Barron's economics editor Gene Epstein, who is also the Soho Forum's co-founder and director. Reason's Nick Gillespie served as moderator.It was an Oxford-style debate, in which the audience votes on the resolution at the beginning and end of the event; the side that gains the most ground is victorious. It was a packed house, with about 450 people in attendance. The pre-debate vote found that 25 percent of the audience agreed that socialism was preferable to capitalism, 49.5 percent picked capitalism as the better system, and 25.5 percent were undecided. Despite a technical problem at the event itself, the Soho Forum was able to recover the final vote totals, which saw support for socialism drop by half a percentage point and support for capitalism increase to 71 percent.Produced by John OsterhoudtPhoto Credit: Brett Raney",PT98M45S,11/14/19,11/14/19,214223,ReasonTV,/channel/UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A,UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A,20,YJQSuUZdcV4

Antarctica: Ready for winter. Antarctic winter is coming: research crews prepare Russia’s stations,Science & Technology,492776,"2,490",205,"More films about surviving winter: https://rtd.rt.com/search/?q=winterAntarctica is key to understanding our world because it is so deeply interconnected with the Earth’s climate and oceans. Geological sampling on this frozen continent provides insight into climate changes over the past million years, allowing scientists to study global warming in a historical context. Russia has been at the forefront of Antarctic exploration for almost two centuries. Since the First Russian Antarctic Expedition in 1820, led by F. F. Bellingshausen and M.P. Lazarev, its scientists have made significant contributions to the investigation and especially the mapping of Antarctica. From that time on, extensive research has been carried out, first by several Soviet and then Russian institutions, and the country now maintains five permanent southern polar stations.The trouble is that, despite advances in modern transport, the only reliable means of reaching the world’s southernmost continent is by sea. The diesel-electric scientific research vessel, “Academic Fyodorov” was almost made for the job and this time, Russia’s polar research fleet flagship is on a mission to visit two year-round Antarctic stations, “Progress” and “Novolazarevskaya”.“Fyodorov”, the only scientific ship able to reach Antarctica without an ice-breaker convoy, has been through thick and thin over the years and so has its crew! The most established member is 86-year-old, Arnold Budretsky, a polar exploration pioneer. There was nothing but ice and stone before he and his fellow explorers first landed on that frozen desert. Arnold himself has taken charge of opening 10 Antarctic stations, and has an impressive reserve of knowledge and experience to pass on to the next generation of explorers. Antarctica is notorious for its unpredictable weather and harsh climate and at sea, the explorers have only themselves to rely on, there are no other vessels for hundreds of miles and nothing but icebergs for company. Just getting to Antarctica takes 6 months, a challenge on its own. There is much for newcomers to learn before settling in as a real part of this small crew: managing food storage for example, and a curious way to keep eggs fresh! People from all walks of life are eager to embark on this voyage to experience the difficulties that research station life entails, which include 24-hour shifts. The hardship makes Antarctica the ultimate survival test. For many though, the severe but beautiful environment becomes almost addictive, so much so that for many, it feels like home.The diesel-electric ice ship Akademik Fyodorov travels to Antarctica, where two of Russia's research stations will receive enough supplies to last them until next summer as winter quickly approaches.SUBSCRIBE TO RTD Channel to get documentaries firsthand! http://bit.ly/1MgFbVyFOLLOW USRTD WEBSITE: https://RTD.rt.com/RTD ON TWITTER: http://twitter.com/RT_DOCRTD ON FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/RTDocumentaryRTD ON DAILYMOTION http://www.dailymotion.com/rt_docRTD ON INSTAGRAM http://instagram.com/rt_documentary/RTD LIVE https://rtd.rt.com/on-air/",PT52M7S,9/20/13,9/20/13,121134,RT Documentary,/channel/UCx8LIRh6VuPamPrqYDNF2QQ,UCx8LIRh6VuPamPrqYDNF2QQ,19,6H-C-23JePM

Agafia. Hermit Surviving in Russian Wilderness for 70 years,Travel & Events,6755999,"42,075","5,664","More films about religion: https://rtd.rt.com/tags/religion/Soon after this film aired, Agafia found a helper who has now been living with her for more than a year. Georgy Danilov, 53, is from Orenburg. He is an Old Believer. It was Agafia’s spiritual father who found and blessed her helper. Georgy has been doing the toughest chores for almost two years: he chops firewood, brings water from the river, and digs the vegetable garden. Agafia doesn’t always see eye to eye with Georgy. She views him as a novice and demands his full obedience and submission, which doesn’t always sit well with Georgy. Despite their differences, they try to find common ground. Apart from the main helper, volunteers and students from various Russian cities also come to Agafia’s hut to help her out.In the mid-17th century, the leader of Russia’s Orthodox Church, Patriarch Nikon, introduced radical reforms in Russia. Many couldn’t accept the changes and became known as “Old Believers”. To avoid religious persecution first from the Orthodox Church and then from the Soviets, families fled to some of the most remote corners of the world. In 1978, one such family was discovered by a group of geologists in the remote Russian Republic of Khakassia, Siberia. The Lykovs looked as if they belonged to a previous century: they dressed in homespun clothes and used primitive instruments in their everyday life. They were completely self-sufficient and still highly religious. Today, Agafia, 70, is the last surviving member of this family.  When RT Doc filmmakers met her, she was in desperate need of a helper. They encourage her to write a letter to Old Believers everywhere in an attempt to find one. This letter, written in Old Slavonic language, is available on our site.The film crew also interviews Erofey Sedov, a former drilling geologist. He was one of those who discovered the Lykovs and told the world about them. He got to know them well and is now ready to share information that will make us see the familiar story of this family of hermits in a different light.

The Dutch 'Military Revolution' During The Eighty Years War | Early-Modern Warfare,Education,244610,"5,732",150,"The Dutch military reforms during the Eighty Years' War influenced the nature of European warfare strongly and lastingly. Facing the Spanish Army, the true military giant of the time, the Dutch were hard pressed to improve their own army with quick but decisive innovation. The backbone of the Spanish Pike and Shot tactic was the so-called ‘Tercio’, a deep square formation consisting of pike men and shot infantry usually supplemented by cavalry and artillery. The basic idea was that the muskets and arquebuses shoot the enemies to pieces while the pikes provide sufficient protection from enemy cavalry attacks. But how did the Dutch counter this military goliath?Recent historiography explains it as follows: During the Eighty Years’ War it became clear to Maurice of Nassau, prince of Orange, that he had to change his army significantly if he wanted to defend the newly formed Dutch federation. But during this period most armed conflicts actually weren't open field battles but sieges. As long as they were entrenched in or themselves sieging a fortress, the expert on this topic Olaf Van Nimwegen explains, the Dutch were well capable to go toe to toe with the Spanish.  But it was crucial to have an effective force that could credibly challenge opponents in open field to prevent becoming the enemy’s puppet. The English officer John Bingham, who had served in the Dutch army, summarized this as follows: “he who is master of the field may spoyle the Enemies Country at his pleasure, he may march where he thinketh best” Thus, the Dutch were primarily concerned with ameliorating their capabilities in open field battles. #history #dutch #netherlandsSome of the music (this particular song is called the 'Landsknecht Music') was provided by MANIK dreams, a dear friend of mine.

Throughout the middle ages, high and relatively thin walls were enough protection against storming ladders, siege equipment and projectiles.But since the 14th century ever more effective firearms and artillery challenged the defensive potential of fortresses. A to and fro of military innovations began – improved fortifications countered improved gunpowder weapons and vice versa. This went on until the end of the 16th century, when according to historian Stephan Hoppe, “a successful solution to all important issues of defense  had been found”.  One famous type of stronghold that was crucial to this evolution was the trace italienne better known as star fortress. It was to be found quickly all over Europe, though in a variety of forms. Historian John A. Lynn states that at the same time the number of fortified sites  increased drastically, so that central European warfare shifted away from open field battles and finally revolved above all around sieges.If you want to support us you can do that here: https://www.patreon.com/sandrhomanhis... #history #siege #sandrhomanSources: Hoppe, S., s.v.

Landsknechts - The Most Sought After Mercenaries in Europe | Late Medieval & Early Modern Warfare,Education,305660,"7,282",164,"The Landsknechts - arguably one of the most famous, most effective and most sought-after mercenary troops of Europe, but sometimes also pitiless plunderers and ruthless rogues. Armed with dreaded pikes and 2 handed swords the Landsknechts were admired by their allies and feared by their enemies. Here’s how the Landsknechts became a force to be reckoned with. Many contemporary historiographical accounts tell the tale of the Landsknechts' rise as follows:In 1465 duke Charles the Bold came to power over the Dutchy of Burgundy. He pursued ambitious goals, namely, to make Burgundy a Kingdom and to expand its borders. Some even say he aspired to become emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. His ambitions to expand his realm ultimately led to the Burgundian Wars (1474-1477), in which the small Swiss Confederacy managed to defeat the overwhelming force of Burgundy in the battles of Grandson, Morat and finally Nancy, where Charles the Bold lost his life. The surprising strength of the Swiss mercenary pike men and the general outcome of this David vs Goliath-like military conflicts drove a good deal of attention to the way of warfare practiced by the old Swiss confederacy, namely to their massed formations of pikes.Sources:Baumann, Reinhard, Landsknechte, Ihre Geschichte und Kultur vom späten Mittelalter bis zum Dreissigjährigen Krieg, München 1994.Fiedler, Siegfried, Kriegswesen und Kriegführung im Zeitalter der Landsknechte (Heerwesen der Neuzeit, Abt. 1, Bd. 2) Koblenz 1985.Fiedler, Siegfried, Landsknechte.

Movie Mistakes Animators Made Without Getting Caught COMPILATION,Entertainment,1220692,"10,000",703,"Did you notice any of these animation mistakes? Movie Mistakes Animators Made Without Getting Caught! Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6We all love animated films right? They’re not only fun but full of memorable characters and most importantly, breathtaking animations.They help take us to new worlds or to see our world in a different light. But despite the attention to detail that goes into them, mistakes still happen. Take Disney’s Frozen, which has it’s fair share of mistakes but the one we’re talking about this time focuses on a certain snowman named Marshmallow. Other Disney and Pixar films have made mistakes, such as Finding Dory, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and Moana. They all look gorgeous but still have something that draws us out a bit. But it’s not all Disney and it’s not all for kids. Batman: The Killing Joke is definitely not for kids but still remains one of the most talked about and polarizing films of that year. One animation mistake can be found during one such scene that divided fans. Other films include the return of Spongebob Squarepants to the big screen and of course, the Minions, who are always up to no good it seems. Luckily for them, this mistake actually has nothing to do with them specifically so they’re off the hook this time. The Peanuts Movie saw the return of Charlie Brown and Snoopy to the big screen yet despite it’s unique and charming animation style, was also the victim of some animation mistakes. Cars 3 raced into cinemas so we looked back at the first Cars, which had an usual cow tipping scene which caused the film one of its biggest mistakes.Check out these other awesome videos!10 Animated Movies That Pushed The Boundaries Too Far For Kidshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE7PT...10 Movies Parents Thought Were For Kids (And Were SO Wrong)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWQdy...Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRantOur Websitehttp://screenrant.com/",PT22M29S,4/18/18,4/18/18,212343,Screen Rant,/channel/UC2iUwfYi_1FCGGqhOUNx-iA,UC2iUwfYi_1FCGGqhOUNx-iA,18,fi3sjt21E7U

Is SpaceX's Raptor engine the king of rocket engines?,Science & Technology,2098903,"67,008","1,334","2:55 - Basic physics of rocket engines 6:10 - Rocket engine cycles 20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines44:05 - SummaryArticle version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823...SpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before! Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX’s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle’s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.And if that’s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they’re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we’ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.We'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.So by the end of this video hopefully we’ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it’s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines…-----------------------------------------------Rocket engine renders by  @MartianDays https://twitter.com/MartianDaysF-1 Turbopump photo provided by Mike Jetzer/heroicrelics.orgHUGE thanks to my Moon Walker Patreon supporters!

Viking House: Full Bushcraft Shelter Build with Hand Tools | Vikings,People & Blogs,6726085,"86,952","4,274","We build a bushcraft viking house from the viking age using hand tools only. Inspired by vikings, who were very resourceful and created buildings using the natural materials they scavenged around them. We used simple hand tools such as axe, saw, auger, drawknife, bushcraft knife and other simple tools.To begin with we cut cedar logs from trees that had been felled in the forest. We used an axe and saw to make log cabin notches and built the foundation of the viking house two logs high. We then used the hand auger to build the timber frame. This consisted of 3 large ""A"" frames. We burnt the ends of the logs in fire to evaporate any moisture and create a rot-proof layer of charred wood which will help to preserve the timber frame foundation when the poles are in the ground. We used a long cedar log as the ridge pole which sits on top of the a frame of the bushcraft shelter. The next stage was building a viking longpit or firepit. This we wanted to make as historically accurate as we could. So we dug a pit about 4 feet long and 2 feet wide. We lined the pit with large stones found in the nearby area. In order to reduce waste of any materials, we used the clay from the pit to secure the stones. We added water to the clay to make it easier to work with and we filled in the gaps between the stones. We then lit a small fire in the pit and let the clay dry out for a few days. At this point we realised we could make our job easier by building a diy saw horse. So we used the drawknife to remove bark from a log (helps to prevent rot). We used the auger to drill four holes for legs and then we made four wood pegs for the top of the saw horse. For the rafters we used more cedar logs and again burnt the ends. It is an ancient japanese technique to preserve wood which is called shou sugi ban. It was then finally time to build the roof of the house. For this, we peeled the bark off the cedar logs. We then put this on the rafters and secured it with some roofing tacks. We had to be fast when doing this, as the cedar bark shrinks and cracks when it dries. We put it on in layers like roof tiles. We built a wood ladder to get up high on the roof and secure the final bark layers. Using an axe and bushcraft, we made some wooden wedges and split a few large cedar logs. We then hewed these logs and built a raised viking bed for the inside of the house. We also made some benches to sit near the fire. At the back of the viking house, we built a folding window and support arm so that we could let light into the house and also improve the airflow. We dug an air vent too, to allow more oxygen to get to the fire. To make the shelter more secure, we built a perimeter wall use cedar posts and hazel saplings (also known as wattle wall). To help further improve the airflow inside the shelter, we cut a hole in the roof and built a ridge cap or ridge vent to act like a chimney and let the smoke out. Overall this viking house took about 10 days to build. It was in winter, so we were restricted by daylight hours. This is not a historically correct viking house. Traditional viking houses were built with large timbers that were hewn from big logs. They had large gable ends almost like log cabins and the roof was made from wood shingles. Often they looked like viking longships or longboats and had many decorative viking features. In a viking longhouse, there would be enough room for many people and animals as well. But this was our take on it. We have done a number of different camping overnight trips in this shelter. We have cooked meat over fire, had great viking feasts and spent many hours keeping warm around the firepit. I hope you enjoyed this vikings inspired bushcraft build.

The punch line occurs when you change direction and take the audience to the unexpected. This same process can be applied to life. Comedian Michael Jr. shows how to take your life's setups and then change direction in a way that brings fulfillment, revelation, and joy not only to you but also to those around you.Once in a generation, a comedian comes along who speaks to everyone. Today, that comedian is known simply as Michael Jr.Watch him onstage and you’ll see a man at ease…with himself, his audience, and his message.

The four-letter code to selling anything | Derek Thompson | TEDxBinghamtonUniversity,Nonprofits & Activism,1021830,"15,198",596,"Why do we like what we like? Raymond Loewy, the father of industrial design, had a theory. He was the all-star 20th-century designer of the Coca-Cola fountain and Lucky Strike pack; the modern sports car, locomotive, Greyhound bus and tractor; the interior of the first NASA spaceship; and the egg-shaped pencil sharpener. How did one man understand what consumers wanted from so many different areas of life? His grand theory of popularity was called MAYA: Most advanced yet acceptable. He said humans are torn between two opposing forces: neophilia, a love of new things; and neophobia; a fear of anything that’s too new. Hits, he said, live at the perfect intersection of novelty and familiarity. They are familiar surprises. In this talk, I’ll explain how Loewy’s theory has been validated by hundreds of years of research — and how we can all use it to make hits.  Derek Thompson is a senior editor at The Atlantic, where he writes about economics, technology and media. He is a news analyst with NPR's afternoon show “Here and Now,"" appearing weekly on Mondays, and an on-air contributor to CBS News.

We cannot look into the head of other people. Still, almost every day we successfully interact with other people. Our brain is specialized in perceiving ""social cues"", and almost automatically perceives basic information about other people, such as age, gender, or ethnicity. How does our brain manage to do this? Is it possible to accurately predict the social behavior of other people? Do we perceive the actions of other people differently in other cultures? I will give you an overview about what the brain perceives from other people and how to deal with it.Dong-Seon is working at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, finishing his PhD thesis in the field of Social Neuroscience.

Imagination: It’s Not What You Think. It’s How You Think | Charles Faulkner | TEDxIIT,Nonprofits & Activism,726334,"8,854",403,"Imagination is not what you think. It’s how you think. Cognitive research reveals that images, metaphors and stories are the basis of our mental operating system: the origin of our intuitions and our irrationality. Counterintuitively, more accurate insights do not come from increasing information or reason, but educating our imagination.Charles Faulkner is an independent researcher on language and its effects on communication, decision-making and change. He has worked in the Silicon Valley, ‘the City’ of London and 3M, HP, IBM, HSBC and Cargill. His decision-making work is featured in books including The New Market Wizards. His popular works include the audio programs: The New Technology of Achievement, Success Mastery, and Creating Irresistible Influence. His original work on metaphoric communication and change is documented in three programs. He has lectured in 15 countries including at the University of Chicago, Columbia College NYC, the Sorbonne, and London School of Economics.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

How the oceans can clean themselves: Boyan Slat at TEDxDelft,Education,3082774,"28,926",378,"18-year-old Boyan Slat combines environmentalism, entrepreneurism and technology to tackle global issues of sustainability. After diving in Greece, and coming across more plastic bags than fish, he wondered; ""why can't we clean this up?""While still being on secondary school, he then decided to dedicate half a year of research to understand plastic pollution and the problems associated with cleaning it up.This ultimately led to his passive clean-up concept, which he presented at TEDxDelft 2012.Working to prove the feasibility of his concept, Boyan Slat currently gives lead to a team of approximately 50 people, and temporarily quit his Aerospace Engineering study to completely focus his efforts on The Ocean Cleanup.The progress of The Ocean Cleanup can be followed through www.theoceancleanup.com, www.facebook.com/TheOceanCleanup, as well as www.twitter.com/TheOceanCleanup.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...Dr. Klaper says he had an awakening while putting people to sleep. When we awaken to the damage that a meat-based diet creates in our body and the toll that the industrial production of animal flesh inflicts upon our planet, we then become aware that the single most effective action anyone can take to improve their personal health and help heal our injured planet is to reduce, or better, eliminate their consumption of meat. Dr. Michael Klaper is a gifted clinician, internationally recognized teacher, and sought-after speaker on diet and health. He has practiced medicine for more than 40 years and is a leading educator in applied plant-based nutrition and integrative medicine. He is also the author of a successful book on cholesterol-free nutrition and an upcoming title (to be announced in 2018), as well as numerous DVDs and Videos on Demand, a series of “Healthy YOU Webinars,” and dozens of articles. A source of inspiration advocating plant-based diets and the end of animal cruelty worldwide, Dr. Klaper contributed to the making of two PBS television programs Food for Thought and the award-winning Diet for a New America movie based on the book of the same name.

The Science of Love | John Gottman | TEDxVeniceBeach,Nonprofits & Activism,480143,"5,716",225,"World-renowned relationship expert John Gottman set forth to understand why relationships don’t work, but for that he needed to first understand relationships scientifically. Gottman then measured the behavior, perception and physiology of couples over time to understand how love works. With that he was able to create equations for love and discern the mathematical dynamics of love. His science was able to predict with a 90% accuracy whether relationships would last or not. Finally, his studies conclude that the magic of love requires calm and commitment, which in the end makes the magic of great love a bit less of a mystery. John Gottman speaks about how his scientific research has now created a new understanding of all love relationships (heterosexual and same-sex), across the entire life span. He describes the new LOVE EQUATIONS, and the magic trio of calm, trust, and commitment. For more, visit The Gottman Institute at https://www.gottman.com/.  World-renowned for his work on marital stability and divorce prediction, Dr. John Gottman has conducted 40 years of breakthrough research with thousands of couples. He is the author of over 200 published academic articles and author or co-author of more than 40 books, including The New York Times bestseller The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.

Dr. Crum's work is inspired in part by the placebo effect, and has implications that stretch far beyond the realm of medicine.Dr. Crum is a professor, psychologist, and researcher investigating how mindsets affect health and behavior. Dr. Crum's research focuses on how changes in subjective mindsets—the lenses through which information is perceived, organized, and interpreted—can alter objective reality through behavioral, psychological, and physiological mechanisms. Her work is, in part, inspired by research on the placebo effect, a notable and consistent demonstration of the ability of the mindset to elicit healing properties in the body.

He highlighted his methods in the groundbreaking BBC TV show, Doctor In The House, gaining him much acclaim from patients, his contemporaries and the media.He is the author of the international bestseller, The 4 Pillar Plan - http://amzn.to/2yGfpuB which has been released in the USA and Canada under the title, How to Make Disease Disappear - https://amzn.to/2GstJf6 Rangan’s 15 years of clinical experience in the NHS includes internal medicine, immunology and general practice. A pioneer in the emerging field of progressive medicine, he also uses techniques from other disciplines he has studied including movement kinetics and functional medicine.His own journey of learning was accelerated when family members fell ill and now Rangan is helping people to take control of their health by addressing the root causes of their illnesses, something which is often not achieved in 21st century health care, evidenced by a steady increase in the rates of chronic disease.Rangan is a super-generalist, looking at as many factors as possible which can create wellness or illness. His talk is testament to how our thinking around the concept of disease needs to change to help form a map for future healthcare.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Don’t get hangry: feed your brain healthy food | Brad Bushman | TEDxColumbus,Nonprofits & Activism,772081,"7,132",514,"One of the two best predictors of success in life is self-control (the other is intelligence). Professor Brad Bushman has been studying human aggression for over 25 years. Aggression often starts when self-control stops. Bushman discusses his research on the link between low self-control and aggression. He focuses on the link between levels of glucose (blood sugar) and self-control. Glucose provides our brain with the fuel it needs to exercise self-control, including control of angry feelings and aggressive impulses. Bushman’s research shows that when people become hungry, they also tend to become angry and aggressive, captured by the term “hangry” (hungry+angry). Healthy foods like veggies, fruits, and whole grains can make people less hangry. Self-control can also be strengthened, like a muscle, through exercise.Brad J. Bushman (Ph.D. 1989, University of Missouri) is a professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University, and a professor of communication science at the VU University, Amsterdam. He holds the Margaret Hall and Robert Randal Rinehart Chair of Mass Communication. For over 25 years he has studied the causes, consequences, and solutions to the problem of human aggression and violence. He is a member of President Obama’s committee on gun violence, and has testified before the U.S. Congress on the topic of youth violence. He has published over 170 peer-reviewed journal articles. According to Google Scholar, his articles have been cited over 25,000 times. He is ranked #2 among communication scholars cited in Google Scholar. In 2014 he received the Distinguished Lifetime Contribution to Media Psychology and Technology, American Psychological Association. His research has challenged several myths (e.g., violent media have a trivial effect on aggression, venting anger reduces aggression, violent people suffer from low self-esteem, violence and sex sell products, warning labels reduce audience size). (One of his colleagues calls him the “myth buster.”) His research has been published in the top scientific journals (e.g., Science, PNAS), and has been featured extensively in the mass media (e.g., BBC, New York Times, NPR).In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

The Super Mario Effect - Tricking Your Brain into Learning More | Mark Rober | TEDxPenn,Nonprofits & Activism,3935822,"168,775","1,570","When 50,000 of Mark Rober's 3 million YouTube subscribers participated in a basic coding challenge, the data all pointed to what Rober has dubbed the Super Mario Effect. The YouTube star and former NASA engineer describes how this data-backed mindset for life gamification has stuck with him along his journey, and how it impacts the ways he helps (or tricks) his viewers into learning science, engineering, and design. Mark Rober has made a career out of engineering, entertainment, and education. After completing degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University and the University of Southern California, Rober joined NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2004. In his nine years as a NASA engineer, seven of which were on the Mars rover Curiosity team, Rober worked on both the Descent Stage (the jet pack that lowered the Rover to the surface) and some hardware on the Rover top deck for collecting samples. In 2011, Rober’s iPad-based Halloween costume helped launch both his creative costume company, Digital Dudz, and his YouTube channel, which now boasts 3 million subscribers and 400 million views. His videos focus on creative ideas and science- and engineering-based pranks and activities. Rober is a regular guest on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"". Today, he does research and development work for a large technology company in Northern California, where he lives with his wife and son.

Mind is Everything | Dr. David Hendricks | TEDxTraverseCity,Nonprofits & Activism,1709325,"10,399",861,"Dr. David Hendricks is motivated to help others achieve sobriety. He integrates the Buddhist philosophy of mind into his mental health practice, explaining that meditation has a profound impact on the brain, including those regions of the brain affected by childhood abuse (he notes such abuse accounts for suffering of drug addiction or mental illness in adulthood). He cites new research that shows the brain has the capacity to grow new cells, and the role of epigenetics. He says a powerfully focused mind can take conscious control of the brain's functions to heal wounds of the past.David Hendricks is a board certified physician. In the early 1980's, he took vows as a Buddhist practitioner, and regularly studied with a Tibetan monk and professor of Buddhist Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. In 1989 he met the Dalai Lama who made a suggestion that changed his life. He and his wife, a Buddhist scholar capable of translating Sanskrit and Tibetan, left the U.S. in 2003 for north India and The Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, and translated and studied a text on Buddhist psychology. They returned to the United States in 2005, and began a treatment center for substance use disorders and other mental health issues.

Why We Struggle Learning Languages | Gabriel Wyner | TEDxNewBedford,Nonprofits & Activism,1218890,"43,477",702,"The only barrier to learning a language is memory. - The process of language learning is the process of forming memories. Nothing more, nothing less. If you understand that, and you understand how memories are formed, then you can make progress in a way you've never dreamed possible before. Gabriel Wyner is an author, opera singer and polyglot based in Chicago. After reaching fluency in German in 14 weeks with the help of the immersive Middlebury Language Schools, he fell in love with the process of language learning, going on to spend two months in intensive Italian courses in Perugia, Italy. Searching for ways to bring the immersion experience into the home, he began to develop a system that rapidly builds fluency in short, daily sessions. In 2010, his efforts paid off. He learned French to fluency in 5 months, and then Russian in 10 months. Born in Los Angeles, he graduated summa cum laude in 2007 from the University of Southern California with dual degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Vocal Arts Performance, and was awarded the Renaissance Scholar’s prize for excellence in unrelated disciplines. He then moved to Vienna to pursue triple Master’s degrees at the Konservatorium Wien in Opera, Lieder and Voice, and graduated with honors in 2011. Currently learning Japanese, he's learned Hungarian and Spanish over the last few years. His book on language learning – Fluent Forever: How to learn any language fast and never forget it – was published on August 5, 2014 (Harmony/Random House). His most recent project has been the development of a new language learning tool, which became the most successful Kickstarter for an app in history in September of 2017.

It is anonymous, faceless and leaderless, and has seen thousands of citizens coming out to fix local civic problems following a simple motto: Kaam Chalu Mooh Bandh. Only Work No Talk. What started off as a series of social experiments in Bangalore in 2011, to see what it takes to change everyday ugly Indian behaviour in public spaces (littering, spitting paan, public urination and more), has now transformed into a nation-wide movement that is spreading virally – both on social media, and on the ground. The centrepiece of the TUI approach is the 'spotfix ' where ugly spots are 'fixed' by citizens. There is no activism, no sloganeering, no lecturing, no finger-pointing and no ideological debates – just a sincere attempt to solve problems by focusing on a spot - using one's own time, hands and money.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

Why do so many incompetent men become leaders? | Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic | TEDxUniversityofNevada,Nonprofits & Activism,798009,"24,601","1,311","There is a pathological mismatch between the qualities that seduce us in a leader and those that are needed to be an effective leader. Based on research on the psychology of leadership, Chamorro-Premuzic shows that if leaders were selected on competence rather than confidence, humility rather than charisma, and integrity rather than narcissism, we would not just end up with more competent leaders, but also more women leaders. In fact, he argues, the main obstacle preventing competent women from becoming leaders is the lack of career obstacles for incompetent men.  Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is an international authority in psychological profiling, talent management, leadership development, and people analytics. He is the Chief Talent Scientist at Manpower Group, co-founder and CEO of DeeperSignals and Metaprofiling, and Professor of Business Psychology at both University College London, and Columbia University. He has previously held academic positions at New York University and the London School of Economics, and lectured at Harvard Business School, Stanford Business School, London Business School, Johns Hopkins, IMD, and INSEAD, as well as being the CEO at Hogan Assessment Systems.

Instead of hapless resolutions members of the ""Lock-In"" cult contract with themselves in a way that they cannot escape from (without suffering brutal consequences). The “Lock-In"" system harnesses our most primal evolutionary instinct - to avoid pain - and uses it to radically supercharge our lives.

The Snowden files -- the inside story of the world’s most wanted man | Luke Harding | TEDxAthens,Nonprofits & Activism,978991,"11,080",698,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. ""We now know, thanks to Edward Snowden- that all of us, Greek citizens, Brits, Americans are being spied and that all of our data - whether its text messages, selfies, G-allocation data from our iphones that we carry around with us - is being collected. Luke thinks that Snowden has done the world a great service by revealing this and thinks it’s got profound implications for democracy – and for all of us – for anyone who uses Facebook or Google or downloads videos from Youtube and so on.So that’s the big picture. On a micro level what we can do about this as citizens?""Luke Harding is a journalist, writer and award-winning correspondent with the Guardian. He has reported from Delhi, Berlin and Moscow and covered wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. Between 2007 and 2011 he was the Guardian's Moscow bureau chief. The Kremlin expelled him from the country in the first case of its kind since the Cold War.His latest book ""The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man"" was published in February by Guardian Faber. In June Oliver Stone bought film rights. Luke is the author of three previous non-fiction books. They are ""The Liar: The Fall of Jonathan Aitken"" (1997), nominated for the Orwell Prize; and ""WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy"" (2011), both written with David Leigh. The screen rights to Wikileaks were sold to Hollywood and the film, ""The Fifth Estate"", starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Bruhl, came out in 2013. ""Mafia State: How One Reporter Became an Enemy of the Brutal New Russia"" appeared in 2011. His books have been translated into 20 languages.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",PT18M57S,12/15/14,12/15/14,143243,TEDx Talks,/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,19,97MWOERY_dE

28 STRANGE Sights on Google Earth,Entertainment,7254663,"27,148","7,050","Every year we come across bizarre and strange sightings that have been picked up by the Google camera, and today we have a look at some of the stranger sights spotted by their satellites. Learn about the BIGGEST of everything Monday, Wednesday, and Friday just subscribe!13 - Refreshes like nothing on earth…This giant Coca-Cola sign is visible from the air and was captured by Google earth in Chile. Sometimes referred to as maptervising, this giant logo was put in place to celebrate their 100th Anniversary. Whether this was the first time maptervising was used, I’m not sure – but we know of several companies who use giant adverts to advertise their products. The unique fact about this one though, is the sign is made from 70,000 empty Coke bottles. 12 - Free Hand… It looks like an intriguing piece of artwork, but it’s actually an aerial shot taken by Google Earth cameras. This one is located in the middle of the desert in China. Of course, speculations ran high as to what it could possible be. Some suggested underground testing facilities, while others thought it could be military runways. The truth wasn’t quite as exciting, but not bad anyway… they are roads used for test drills. 11 - Connect the dots…These are oil fields with connecting roads located in Rio Negro in Argentina. This is a spectacular image which we can thank Google Earth for! 10 - The dark knight rises…Over in Okinawa in Japan they have a very special sight that can only be viewed from above. It’s the Batman symbol, and you’ll have to fly over the roof top of the Air Force’s 44th Fighter Squadron. It’s not new though, and has been around since the 80’s… it’s only come to light recently thanks to Google Earth. 9 - Look closely…You’ll have to stretch your imagination for this one. A guy in Sweden truly believes that this obscure image from Google Earth is the real-life Nessie.  8 - Crawl back into your shell… You’ve probably heard of the massive Japanese Spider Crab, they’re literally enormous but they’re nowhere near the size of this crab that was spotted on Google earth. It’s earned the nickname Crabzilla, and is roughly 50-feet wise. It was spotted in Kent Harbour in the UK. Legit or not, I’ll let you decide. 7 - Stranger Things…The second season of Stranger Things sees an underground complex network of roots emerge. When I see this image that was captured by Google Earth, I think of that – and it leaves me feeling a little unsettled. 6 - All ears… We head to Alberta in Canada and meet the Badlands Guardian. This geological marvel looks like a man with a headdress wearing an earphone. It’s obviously not that, but rather a road and an oil well that have been installed on the site. If you go and view this image on Google Earth, and you scroll further to the left, you’ll spot another face which looks like someone is yawning and waking up from a deep sleep. 5 - Shrouded in mystery… Could this possibly be the remains of a pyramid that has not been excavated yet? Google Earth captured this image somewhere across Egypt, and reports suggest that due to the current economic situation in Egypt, they’ve limited the number of sites being excavated and researched. Others who have spotted this image believe it to just be a natural part of the landscape. I’m leaning towards pyramid, how about you? 4 - Blast from the past…In more ways than one! This is the world’s best-preserved meteorite on earth and it’s located a few minutes from Interstate 40 and Route 66. It's’ said an asteroid hit earth at 26,000 miles per hour 50,000 years ago and those are the remains! The crater is roughly 1 mile across, 2.4 miles in circumference and 550ft deep. You’re welcome to go and visit the site yourself! Its open to tourists! 3 - Hypnotising… These fields captured by Google Earth are seriously hypnotising, and remind me of a patchwork quilt. 2 - You decide… Sand banks? Aliens? Wake of water? Deep sea creature? No one seems to have legitimate answers, so if you can shed some light on that bizarre image captured on Google Earth, please share it with us down below!",PT10M1S,1/26/18,1/26/18,122144,The BIGGEST,/channel/UCvpjSSIodRfDo9sgwMXLaTw,UCvpjSSIodRfDo9sgwMXLaTw,20,njiSn2aaS88

How could veganism change the world? | The Economist,Film & Animation,724234,"28,957","1,648","Interest in vegan food and its associated health benefits has been booming across the rich world. A global retreat from meat could have a far-reaching environmental impact.Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy By 2050 the world's population could approach 10 billion - and around 60% more food could be needed to feed everyone. The environmental impacts of the food system are daunting its responsible for about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions and uses about 70% of all freshwater resources, and it occupies about 40% of the Earth's land surface.Food rated emissions could increase to 50 percent by 2050 and fill up the total emissions budget that we have in order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.Interest in vegan food has been booming across the rich world. A major study has put the diet to the test -  analyzing an imagined scenario in which the world goes vegan by 2050. If everybody went vegan by 2050 we estimated that food-related greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 3/4.Cows are the biggest emission contributors. Bugs in their digestive system produce methane and deforestation for their pasture releases carbon dioxide - these gases warm the planet. If cows were a country, they'd be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter.Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.For more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ Check out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk Like The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ Follow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ Follow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist",PT6M30S,11/27/18,11/27/18,134131,The Economist,/channel/UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,20,hwoL6hWd4l0

As in previous reports, thousands of peer-reviewed articles are cited to determine the current state-of-the-art of climate science. This newest volume's findings challenge the alarmist reports of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose next report is due out later this month. NIPCC authors paid special attention to contributions that were overlooked by the IPCC or that presented data, discussion, or implications, arguing against the IPCC's claim that dangerous global warming is occurring, or will occur, from human-related greenhouse gas emissions.",PT58M17S,9/24/13,9/24/13,211231,The Heritage Foundation,/channel/UC5bEfSFTYQVfLCwkhBt8NtQ,UC5bEfSFTYQVfLCwkhBt8NtQ,20,jaVL1Ham-4A

What if Scandinavia United? How Powerful Would It Be?,Education,1300566,"21,136","2,829","What if Scandinavia (Norway, Denmark & Sweden) united into United Scandinavia? What would their economy be like? Would it be one of the most powerful countries? What exactly is Scandinavia? The countries of Scandinavia are Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. We might also refer to the Scandinavian Peninsula, or Fennoscandia, which also comprises Finland and parts of Russia. Moreover, we talk about Nordic countries, and these include Iceland, Greenland and Faroe Islands. But today we are talking about three countries alone, and they are Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The countries have similar customs and cultures, and the languages are not far apart. The EU tells us the citizens of all these countries will likely be able to read each other’s language, although Swedes and Norwegians can have trouble understanding spoken Danish, even though the Danish and Norwegian languages are the most similar. Now, let’s look at what would happen if those countries finally came together, in this episode of the Infographics Show, What if Scandinavia United?SUBSCRIBE TO US -► http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITE (SUGGEST A TOPIC):http://theinfographicsshow.com SUPPORT US: Patreon.......► https://www.patreon.com/theinfographi...

Will the humanity live on? Is oil really necessary? (Facts checked)Unless you've been living in a hippy commune for the last century, you know that oil is the lifeblood of our civilization. It powers every single aspect of our modern lives, it is so vital to our way of life that wars have been threatened, and fought over it. In 1991, Iraq managed to raise the ire of the largest coalition of nations in history when it threatened 70% of the world's oil supply; more so than human rights, anti-fascism, or justice, oil- sadly- is the single most unifying force in the world. But what if the tap was turned off permanently? What if the world woke up to discover all the oil in the world was used up? Hello and welcome to another episode of The Infographics Show- today we're asking, what would happen if the world ran out of oil?Profits vary depending on supply, demand, and total output- but in 2013 while the rest of the world was still recovering from a global financial crash, the big 5 oil companies- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Shell- were generating $177,000 in profit every minute, or $93 billion dollars a year. With so much money, oil companies have been able to exert an incredible amount of influence across the world.Yet we desperately need oil for our daily lives- it powers the vehicles that bring us to work, creates plastics that go into the cheap products that makes life so convenient, and is even refined into life-saving medicines. With oil so critical to civilization, what would happen if it ran out?SUBSCRIBE TO US -► http://bit.ly/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITE (SUGGEST A TOPIC):http://theinfographicsshow.com SOCIAL:Twitter........► https://twitter.com/TheInfoShowSubreddit...► http://reddit.com/r/TheInfographicsShow--------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources for this episode:https://pastebin.com/2H4d3hXE",PT9M26S,12/25/18,12/25/18,211143,The Infographics Show,/channel/UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,20,c4OqDTBZZ9A

Rivers are the main source of ocean plastic pollution. They are the arteries that carry waste from land to the ocean. Our research found that 1000 rivers are responsible for roughly 80% of the pollution.Working together with government leaders and private corporations, our goal is to tackle these 1000 most polluting rivers, all over the world, by 2025. How? By deploying Interceptors. The Interceptor is The Ocean Cleanup’s answer for river plastic waste.

How we will rid the oceans of plastic - Boyan Slat | Live events | The Ocean Cleanup,Science & Technology,763978,"11,819",243,"On May 11th 2017, Boyan Slat, Founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, the Dutch foundation developing advanced technologies to rid the oceans of plastic, announced a design breakthrough allowing for the cleanup of half the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in just 5 years.The main idea behind The Ocean Cleanup is to let the ocean currents do the work. An installation of U-shaped screens channels floating plastic to a central point. The concentrated plastic can then be extracted and shipped to shore for recycling into durable products. The improvements involve the introduction of a mobile, or drifting system. Rather than fixing the floating screens to the seabed at great depths, The Ocean Cleanup will apply sea anchors to ensure the floating screens move slower than the plastic. Rather than one massive barrier, the improved, modular cleanup system consists of a fleet of screens.More information:http://www.theoceancleanup.comDon't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel.And check out The Ocean Cleanup on:http://facebook.com/theoceancleanuphttp://twitter.com/theoceancleanuphttp://instagram.com/theoceancleanupCredits:©The Ocean CleanupProduction: Jurlights.nl / Bind FilmBroadcast: Nepworldwide.nlComputer renderings: Erwin Zwart / The Ocean CleanupMusic: Andrew D.

Jim Al-Khalili - Quantum Life: How Physics Can Revolutionise Biology,Science & Technology,668345,"7,100",276,"In this Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution, Professor Jim Al-Khalili explores how the mysteries of quantum theory might be observable at the biological level. Jim's book ""Life on the Edge: The Coming of Age of Quantum Biology"" is available to buy now - https://geni.us/kJrKCzAlthough many examples can be found in the scientific literature dating back half a century, there is still no widespread acceptance that quantum mechanics -- that baffling yet powerful theory of the subatomic world -- might play an important role in biological processes. Biology is, at its most basic, chemistry, and chemistry is built on the rules of quantum mechanics in the way atoms and molecules behave and fit together. As Jim explains, biologists have until recently been dismissive of counter-intuitive aspects of the theory and feel it to be unnecessary, preferring their traditional ball-and-stick models of the molecular structures of life. Likewise, physicists have been reluctant to venture into the messy and complex world of the living cell - why should they when they can test their theories far more cleanly in the controlled environment of the physics lab?But now, experimental techniques in biology have become so sophisticated that the time is ripe for testing ideas familiar to quantum physicists. Can quantum phenomena in the subatomic world impact the biological level and be present in living cells or processes - from the way proteins fold or genes mutate and the way plants harness light in photosynthesis to the way some birds navigate using the Earth's magnetic field?

Since that time most major scientific figures have spoken in the famous Lecture Theatre at the heart of the Ri building at 21 Albemarle Street. Notable talks include Faraday announcing the existence of the technology of photography in 1839 and J.J. Thomson announcing the existence of the fundamental particle later called the electron in 1897.The Ri is on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ri_scienceand Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitutionand Tumblr: http://ri-science.tumblr.com/Our editorial policy: http://www.rigb.org/home/editorial-po...Subscribe for the latest science videos: http://bit.ly/RiNewsletter",PT59M58S,1/30/13,1/30/13,312323,The Royal Institution,/channel/UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw,UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw,19,wwgQVZju1ZM

The Genesis of the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic,Education,316744,,,"Michael Worobey, Professor, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, The University of ArizonaThe Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 was the most intense outbreak of disease in human history. It killed upwards of 50 million people (most in a six-week period) casting a long shadow of fear and mystery: nearly a century later, scientists have been unable to explain why, unlike all other influenza outbreaks, it killed young adults in huge numbers. I will describe how analyses of large numbers of influenza virus genomes are revealing the pathway traveled by the genes of this virus before it exploded in 1918. What emerges is a surprising tale with many players and plot lines, in which echoes of prior pandemics, imprinted in the immune responses of those alive in 1918, set the stage for the catastrophe. I will also discuss how resolving the mysteries of 1918 could help to prevent future pandemics and to control seasonal influenza, which quietly kills millions more every decade.",PT68M9S,5/1/14,5/1/14,214114,The University of Arizona,/channel/UCxtFtv498asEMr883r3o-Dg,UCxtFtv498asEMr883r3o-Dg,20,48Klc3DPdtk

Smashing Hitler’s Panzers by Mr. Steven Zaloga,Education,106097,"1,439",81,"Smashing Hitler’s Panzers: The Defeat of the Hitler Youth Panzer Division during the Battle of the Bulge by Mr. Steven ZalogaLate in January 1945, through the snowy forests and farms of the Ardennes, the cream of Hitler’s remaining army struggled through a muddy retreat, defeated in the final offensive the Wehrmacht attempted during World War II.  The stubborn American victory over Hitler’s “Autumn Mist” attack was by no means a foregone conclusion when the German command launched the attack a month earlier.  Actions by the U. S. Army’s 1st, 2nd, and 99th divisions from the very start of the offensive stymied the push of the 12th SS Panzer Division on the roads to the essential port of Antwerp.  On March 27th, 2019, the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, hosted author and scholar Mr. Steven Zaloga, as he presented a talk based on his newest book, Smashing Hitler’s Panzers: The Defeat of the Hitler Youth Panzer Division during the Battle of The Bulge.  Mr. Zaloga argued that the defeat of the 12th SS Hitlerjugend Division in the opening hours and days of the offensive were essential to the over-all failure of the German Ardennes Campaign.Mr. Steven Zaloga outlined his argument that the German offensive through the Ardennes Forest, known as the “Battle of the Bulge,” hinged on the first days of the attack.  The only Americans to hold their section of the line capitalized on German planning mistakes pushing back one of the primary components of the attack, the 12th SS Panzer Division. The failure of the 12th in the battles of Krinkelterwald, Krinkelter-Rocherath, and Dom Butenbach against portions of three U.S. Army infantry divisions was essential to the German defeat, well before the fighting at Bastogne.",PT66M31S,4/10/19,4/10/19,314134,TheUSAHEC,/channel/UC-2qq8mcZXIdOrcg4ER8qjw,UC-2qq8mcZXIdOrcg4ER8qjw,19,6LOfS2kp7V8

Hannibal’s tactical genius is illustrated with the latest three-dimensional graphics technology and exciting dramatic reconstructions of his victories. This is the story of the General who took on the might of Rome. Hannibal led his forces, including a squadron of elephants, through France, over the Alps and into the heart of Italy. For 15 years he fought the Romans using their own country as his battlefield and his base. With his small forces, he destroyed larger well-trained Roman Armies with almost contemptuous ease.

Mary I - Bloody Mary (British Monarchy Documentary) | Timeline,Education,5073549,"32,232","2,569","Mary was a queen driven by faith, she would send hundreds of her subjects to burn at the stake.Written and presented by Dr David Starkey, this is the compelling story of two of England's most striking monarchs: a brother and sister, tied by blood and affection, and torn apart by religion, power, and some of the bloodiest episodes in English history. Mary (who was to become England's first reigning Queen since Matilda but who is best known to generations of British schoolchildren as Bloody Mary) was the first born child of Henry VIII. For 20 years she was heir to her adored father. Then came the birth of her little half-brother Edward, and Mary found herself cast into the shadows, ignored by her father and declared illegitimate by Act of Parliament. Nonetheless she became very attached to the motherless boy, and he to her, declaring her his dearest sister. When Edward was just nine, their father died and the young boy became King, surrounded by advisors and further distanced from his beloved elder sister. But by now they were divided not just by power and status, but also by faith. Mary was a staunch Catholic, Edward a reforming Protestant: at this time such matters were not an issue of personal choice but matters of life or death, treason or heresy. Within a few years Mary was under virtual house arrest and banned from celebrating mass; within a few more years Edward was dead at the tragically early age of 16 and Mary became Queen. She set about making England a Catholic country once more and hundreds of Protestants, including Edward's most trusted advisors, were burnt at the stake because they refused to renounce their faith.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

Vesuvius (Pompeii Documentary) | Timeline,Education,737541,"4,963",249,"Exploring what really happened at Herculaneum following the eruption of Vesuvius.Pompeii, the lost Roman city buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79AD, has long been a source of fascination to archaeologists.  But its sister city Herculaneum, buried in the same eruption but to a much greater depth than Pompeii, reveals far more detail of how the Romans lived. For many years the city appeared to have been abandoned and it was assumed the inhabitants had managed to escape in the hours before Herculaneum was engulfed by the volcano. Then in the 1980s a macabre discovery was made. Burrowing through the volcanic mud, archaeologists found hundreds of bodies huddled pitifully together. Vesuvius is still active and is on course to erupt again. The lure of its rich volcanic soil and the delights of the Bay of Naples have attracted a far greater population than lived there in Roman times. And while civil servants at the Vesuvius observatory express confidence that there will be ample warning and time to evacuate the surrounding population, many geologists disagree. Evidence from an eruption in 4000 BC reveals that the volcano is capable of destroying Naples, a cataclysm far greater than that of 79 AD. If that were to happen today it could engulf 3 million people. On that scale, in an area where motorway traffic jams are a fact of daily life, present evacuation plans are completely inadequate.Sign up to History Hit with code 'timeline' for 80% off http://bit.ly/TimelineSignUpContent licensed from Digital Rights Group (DRG).Produced by Dragonfly Film and Television Productions.Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com",PT53M35S,6/7/17,6/7/17,323141,Timeline - World History Documentaries,/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg,UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg,20,nvFlEJpuTfo

The first instalment focuses on Britain under Roman rule, revealing a much greater degree of collaboration with the natives than was previously recognised.Sheep-farming archaeologist, Francis Pryor, presents a historical series which explores Britain A.D, the British national character and the ultimate British icon King Arthur.Finding new and previously unexplained evidence, Francis Pryor overturns the idea that Britain reverted to a state of anarchy and disorder after the Romans left in 410 AD. Instead of doom and gloom Francis discovers a continuous culture that assimilated influences from as far a field as the Middle East and Constantinople. Through scrutinising the myth of King Arthur to find out what was really going on when the Romans left, Francis is confronted by evidence that confounds traditional views of the 'Dark Ages'. There was also no invasion of bloodthirsty Anglo Saxons, rampaging across the countryside.

Make sure to subscribe and never miss a single video!No one today can really get a full idea of what it was like to live surrounded by dinosaurs. While today we know that some animals like killer whales, alligators, lions and other big predators can be threatening to us humans, none of these can compare to the danger that dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals represented. Today we’ll have a look at ten animals that were scarier than dinosaurs. You’ll realize that dinosaurs were harmless and perhaps even friendly compared to the beasts I’ll show you today. I’ll also talk about some of the movies that fed us ideas of what these animals were like, and I’ll compare those ideas to actual facts that will make you understand how real life creatures were in fact a bit scarier than what we see on the screen. Stay tuned all the way to number one and find out about an animal that you’ll be thankful to know it’s gone extinct. 10. Arthropleura I’m going to start with an animal that was not as big as a dinosaur. In fact, it wasn’t even a carnivore! But I’m sure you’d be quite scared and probably a bit grossed out if you were to encounter it today. And I’m pretty sure you’d rather see a dinosaur instead of this animal. The Arthropleura was a millipede that could reach lengths of up to 2.5 meters, which means, if it were to stand on the lower end of its thousand feet, it would be higher than a christmas tree! The Arthropleura is known to be the largest invertebrate of all time. With such aspect, I doubt any predators wanted to mess with it.9. DunkleosteusYikes! Even the name sounds scary already. If you’re wondering what this animal looked like, let me start by pointing out that the Dunkleosteus was a fish! Of course, we’re not talking about a cute tropical fish or even a shark like the one from Jaws. This prehistoric fish was 33 feet long! Which means it was almost twice as long as the height of a giraffe from its head to its feet. However, what makes this animal threatening is not only its size, but also its sharp teeth. The bones in its jaw kept growing continuously, up until a point where their edges would become so sharp as they rubbed together against each other. These were useful tools to pierce and chew on their prey . This fish was as heavy as a hippopotamus and could easily snatch its prey in less than a second. 8. JaekelopterusThe Jaekelopterus was an aquatic arthropod. The best way to explain it is by pointing out that some people call it a “Giant Sea Scorpion” - can you picture that? If scorpions are scary already, I don’t want to imagine what it would be like to come face to face with a giant one in the middle of the ocean! It’s an experience that would definitely keep me away from the waters for good. The name Jaekelopterus comes from Otto Jaekel, a German paleontologist who was the first one to describe the species. Although its maximum size has not been confirmed, some experts believed the largest Jaekelopterus could have reached a length of 2.5 meters, making it taller than humans if it were to stand. This animal is believed to have lived in freshwater, making it a threat to other arthropods and smaller fish. Poor animals didn’t stand a chance against this huge creature! 7. HelicoprionAnd here is another fish on our list! Or...maybe not. One of the craziest facts about the helicoprion is that no one has been able to properly classify it and associate it to the animal groups we have today. We can say it’s a fish because it lived in the water, but paleontologists didn’t have enough information to categorize it. Its teeth worked like a circular blade. Without any proper teeth in the upper jaw, this creature could gum you and bite you at the same time..quite scary and gross! The lower teeth were sharp, so it’s safe to assume that the helicoprion was a carnivore! What scientists can’t figure out yet is whether it fed on small or big animals - they can only speculate as they still haven’t found any remains of a skull to properly figure out what its diet was. One thing is for sure, that odd looking jaw is more than enough to scare us all if we were to encounter it in the ocean today.Leave a like for more shark tank, pawn stars, dr. phil, and other tv show business content.

Ebola Survivor - Dr. Ian Crozier,Education,327586,,,"Dr. Ian Crozier contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone while treating Ebola patients in the government hospital in Kenema as a volunteer for the World health Organization. He was evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Sept. 9, 2014, the third American with Ebola to be airlifted there from West Africa. He spent an agonizing 40 days in the hospital before finally recovering.  Less than two months later, he developed soaring pressure in his left eye, with nausea and headaches. Test results were completely unexpected: the inside of his left eye was teeming with Ebola.  Dr. Crozier, who also suffers from hearing loss, joint and muscle pain, disabling fatigue, problems with memory loss and word-finding, calls himself a poster child for “post-Ebola syndrome”.

Pumped Dry: The Global Crisis of Vanishing Groundwater | USA TODAY,News & Politics,712896,"6,205",633,"In places around the world, supplies of groundwater are rapidly vanishing. As aquifers decline and wells begin to go dry, people are being forced to confront a growing crisis.Much of the planet relies on groundwater. And in places around the world – from the United States to Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America – so much water is pumped from the ground that aquifers are being rapidly depleted and wells are going dry.Groundwater is disappearing beneath cornfields in Kansas, rice paddies in India, asparagus farms in Peru and orange groves in Morocco. As these critical water reserves are pumped beyond their limits, the threats are mounting for people who depend on aquifers to supply agriculture, sustain economies and provide drinking water. In some areas, fields have already turned to dust and farmers are struggling.Climate change is projected to increase the stresses on water supplies, and heated disputes are erupting in places where those with deep wells can keep pumping and leave others with dry wells. Even as satellite measurements have revealed the problem’s severity on a global scale, many regions have failed to adequately address the problem. Aquifers largely remain unmanaged and unregulated, and water that seeped underground over tens of thousands of years is being gradually used up.In this documentary, USA TODAY and The Desert Sun investigate the consequences of this emerging crisis in several of the world’s hotspots of groundwater depletion. These are stories about people on four continents confronting questions of how to safeguard their aquifers for the future – and in some cases, how to cope as the water runs out.****************Humankind: Amazing moments that give us hope ➤ http://bit.ly/2MrPxvdHumankind: Stories worth sharing ➤ http://bit.ly/2FWYXNPAnimalkind: Cute, cuddly & curious animals ➤ http://bit.ly/2GdNf2jJust the FAQs: When news breaks, we break it down for you ➤ http://bit.ly/2Dw3Wnh The Wall: An in-depth examination of Donald Trump’s border wall ➤ http://bit.ly/2sksl8F",PT63M58S,8/14/18,8/14/18,11143,USA TODAY,/channel/UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g,UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g,20,RjsThobgq7Q

Parallel Worlds Probably Exist.

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUMSpecial thanks to:Prof. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.comHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'Code for solving the Schrödinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/Quantum...I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iván TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com ""Experimental 1"" ""Serene Story 2"" ""Seaweed"" ""Colorful Animation 4""",PT20M0S,3/6/20,3/6/20,212112,Veritasium,/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA,20,kTXTPe3wahc

At least one million of them are believed to be living in what the U.N. described as a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy,” while many Uighur children are taken to state-run orphanages where they're indoctrinated into Chinese customs.The Uighurs' plight has largely been kept hidden from the world, thanks to China’s aggressive attempts to suppress the story at all costs.VICE News’ Isobel Yeung posed as a tourist to gain unprecedented access to China’s western Xinjiang region, which has been nearly unreachable by journalists.She and our crew experienced China’s Orwellian surveillance and harassment first-hand during their time in Xinjiang, and captured chilling hidden-camera footage of eight Uighur men detained by police in the middle of the night. We spoke with members of the Uighur community about their experience in these camps, and about China’s attempts to silence their history and lifestyle under the cover of darkness.Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-NewsCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.comFollow VICE News here:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenewsTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenewsTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/Instagram: http://instagram.com/vicenewsMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo#VICENewsTonight",PT31M48S,6/29/19,6/29/19,311323,VICE News,/channel/UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,20,v7AYyUqrMuQ

Aretha Franklin’s musical genius in 2 songs,News & Politics,836894,"25,521",385,"Two songs that show off Aretha Franklin’s gospel roots.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOAretha Franklin will always be the Queen of Soul. In the 1960s songs like “Respect” became the symbol for political and social change. It’s likely the reason her music moved so many people wasn’t necessarily the lyrics, but the way she delivered them. Aretha was raised in the church, and her life and music was rooted in gospel music. You can hear this so clearly in her live performances and covers, where every musical decision she made was in the moment. Listen to any one of Aretha’s songs and you’ll understand the power of gospel music, but her live performance of “Dr. Feelgood” and her cover of “Son of a preacher man” are a great place to start. Special thanks to Brigitta Johnson, Robert Darden, and Raymond Wise for sharing their expertise in gospel music history. Note: The title of this video has been updated.

Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,News & Politics,2396144,"78,988","44,498","Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOOver the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.Read more of Ornstein and Mann’s work here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/op...On Strikethrough, Vox producer Carlos Maza explores the challenges facing the news media in the age of Trump.

A foreign accent is when someone speaks a second language with the rules of their first language, and one of the most persistent and well-studied foreign-accent features is a lack of L/R contrast among native Japanese speakers learning English. It’s so well-known that American soldiers in World War II reportedly used codewords like “lallapalooza” to distinguish Japanese spies from Chinese allies. But American movies and TV shows have applied this linguistic stereotype to Korean and Chinese characters too, like Kim Jong Il in Team America: World Police, or Chinese restaurant employees singing “fa ra ra ra ra” in A Christmas Story. However, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese  are completely different languages that each handle L-sound and R-sounds differently.

How heavy metal and Satan gave us this sticker,Music,2211614,"68,423","1,503","Heavy metal and Satan played a role in the introduction of the explicit lyrics sticker.Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labThe explicit lyrics sticker is one of the most recognizable images in American music. Its placement on an album cover signifies you’re going to hear something for adult ears only, and it’s an image we often take for granted. The story behind how we got that sticker is bonkers, to say the least. The very public discussion around the advisory label involved the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), a group led by the wives of Washington politicians and a few musicians including Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver.While the PMRC’s involvement was allegedly sparked by some raunchy lyrics from Prince’s 1984 album Purple Rain, the debate over rock lyrics had been infiltrating American culture and politics for a decade. The driving force behind that debate was the rise of heavy metal, a genre that saw explosive popularity with the launch of MTV in 1981, and the growing influence of the religious right, who saw rock music as a powerful threat to Christianity.

Waste is food - VPRO documentary - 2007,News & Politics,67760,963,37,"The waste we discard does not disappear. That is impossible, because the Earth is a closed system. Our waste only seems invisible because we dilute it with water, cover it with earth or have the wind blow it away. But in the end, we cannot avoid encountering it again. In our drinking water, in the air we breathe, in our food and in our body. In this episode of Backlight, the designer William McDonough and the chemist Michael Braungart discuss the solution to this problem: the principle of Waste = Food. An inspiring documentary on the Cradle to Cradle design concept of the chemist Michael Braungart and the architect William McDonough.Man is the only creature that produces landfills. Natural resources are being depleted on a rapid scale while production and consumption are rising in na­tions like China and India. The waste production worldwide is enormous and if we do not do anything we will soon have turned all our resources into one big messy landfill. But there is hope. The German chemist Michael Braungart, and the American designer-architect William McDonough are fundamentally changing the way we produce and build. If waste would become food for the biosphere or the technosphere (all the technical products we make), produc­tion and consumption could become beneficial for the planet. A design and production concept that they call Cradle to Cradle. A concept that is seen as the next industrial revolution: design every product in such a way that at the end of its lifecycle the component materials become a new resource.But also design buildings in such a way that they produce energy and become a friend to the environment. Large companies like Ford and Nike are working with McDonough and Braun­gart to change their production facilities and their products. They realize that economically wise, waste is a destruction of capital. You make something with no value. Based on their ideas the Chinese government is working towards a circular economy where Waste = Food. An amazing story that will definitely change your way of thinking about production and consumption.This documentary won the Silver Dragon at the Beijing International Science Film Festival 2006.Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2007.© VPRO Backlight June 2007On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.

Shale cowboys: fracking under Trump | VPRO Documentary | 2017,News & Politics,948422,"7,130","1,170","Having your own energy sources is an important weapon in the world economy. Since 2013, the United States has made important foes of fossil-rich opponents like Saudi Arabia important in extracting shale gas and shale oil from its own soil. The price for a barrel of crude oil fell from 100 to less than $50. The Texan shale producers who survived this price tag are the new heroes of the United States. Under president Donald Trump, the shale cowboys are striving to help Europe to become independent. On research in Trumpland.Original title: SchaliecowboysSchale stone was considered worthless by the oil and gas industry in the past. They passed through on their way to expensive oil and gas that lay deeper. Until a small Texan gas company found a way in the late 1990's to win gas from hard-shelled rock. By making deep boreholes in the stone layers of the soil and injecting a large amount of water and chemicals under high pressure, shale gas and shale oil are won. With this method, later known as fracking, the energy market changed forever.In the meantime, one third of gas and oil production in the United States is a shale.And the bid consumer of energy is not only content to be independent, the country is now even an exporter of energy. OPEC, the organization of (other) oil exporting countries, keeps the oil price on the world market as low as possible, to make American production worthless. But for the moment, the oil countries do not get the shale cowboys on their knees.How does this controversial innovation put the world of energy upside down? Because this new offer of cheap energy really gives us more time to bridge the transition to a sustainable world of solar and wind energy. A few years ago, all experts and analysts went out of the Peak Oil Theory. Namely, the fossil reserves in the world were running out. The shale revolution turned this theory into old dirt in just a few years. Fracking technology opens a whole new reservoir of fossil fuels. The election of President Trump was greeted in Texas with joy and also seen as a recognition for what the shale revolution is going to be. And the future is even more rosy: recent geological research showed that hundreds of billions of dollars of shale oil are still in the so-called Wolf Camp Shale Field in West Texas. Who are the people behind this shale revolution? A portrait of the pioneers and the new Shale millionaires in Texas.Daniel Yergin (energy specialist and author of The Prize and The Quest), Dan Steward, Kent Bowker and Nick Steinsberger (Shale Gas Revolution Geologists and Pioneers), Matt Miller (Dallas Gray Gray Energy Partners), Doug Shanda (Head of Operations Cheniere Energy in Port Arthur), Tommy Taylor (Director of Fasken Oil & Ranch from Midland Texas).Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2017.© VPRO Backlight February 2017On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs, finance, sustainability, climate change or politics every week.

The ocean plastic cleanup of Boyan Slat | VPRO Documentary,News & Politics,90989,"1,693",44,"With the ocean plastic cleanup, Boyan Slat has set up the first and the greatest ocean plastic cleanup campaign in history. And it all started about five years ago, with a graduation project about the plastic soup in the ocean. Today, Boyan Slat has eighty employees, and he is about to roll out his first Ocean Cleanup system in the Pacific. VPRO Backlight follows Boyan Slat closely on the exciting journey of the ocean plastic cleanup.Boyan Slat's fight against the plastic soup. By now, everybody will have seen the images of the plastic soup in the ocean. And everybody agrees that something has to be done. But it is not all that clear how we should tackle the plastic soup problem, or what would work best. Around this time, in the Pacific, between San Francisco and Hawaii, the brainchild of the inventor Boyan Slat is put in place: System 001. This five million dollar and 600-metre long floating colossus is the starting point for the largest ocean plastic cleanup campaign in history. Boyan Slat, a 24-year-old pioneer has worked towards this moment, day and night, for five years on end. Today, his 'The Ocean Cleanup' foundation employs eighty people with only one mission: a plastic-free ocean by the year 2050. To get to that point, over one hundred systems will be tug to the centres of the five different gyres. Those places in the oceans where plastic waste accumulates as a result of the ocean current. At the same time, we will have to come up with a solution at the source to avoid plastic waste ending up in the ocean in the first place. For with a plastic consumption of 320 million tonnes a year, something will have to change at the source too. VPRO Backlight followed the preparations for the long-awaited launch up close. What are the chances of success for his mission? And who are his examples and financiers?

"Cruise ships kept sailing in the Caribbean, even as signs of sickness spread",News & Politics,298352,"2,870",277,"As the coronavirus outbreak was spiraling into what became a pandemic and cruise ships began to report confirmed exposures, thousands of tourists continued to visit one of the most popular cruise destinations: the Caribbean. The $100 billion cruise industry transports some 30 million passengers around the world every year, an industry trade association said, with nearly a third of all cruise ships in the Caribbean. That’s a fraction of those who travel by air, a major factor in the spread of the virus. But public health experts said cruise ships create unique opportunities for infectious diseases to spread.Along with airplanes, cruise ships also played a role in the spread of the virus in the Caribbean, a region with small island populations and a fragile health-care system. While air travelers brought the first cases to islands such as St. Lucia and Cuba, cruise passengers were the first confirmed coronavirus patients in places such as the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico, according to local health officials. A Post analysis found that five ships — the Costa Favolosa, Costa Magica, Costa Luminosa, MS Braemar and MSC Meraviglia — made 18 stops in the Caribbean between Feb. 29 and March 11 while carrying someone who later tested positive for coronavirus. As of April 20, at least 145 crew members and 48 passengers who were aboard the Costa Luminosa have tested positive for the coronavirus. This is the story of how the Luminosa was able to continue sailing, even as signs of sickness spread. Read the story: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphi....

12 Mysterious Creatures Discovered After Tsunamis,Entertainment,524450,"2,746","1,666","With 95% of the world’s water left unexplored, it’s no surprise that natural disasters could cause curious creatures to rise from the depths. SUBSCRIBE for the latest videos: https://goo.gl/7xzjzRDon't forget to CHECK OUT our latest upload: https://goo.gl/LUB8Xw12. Mussels & Starfish & Clams A year after Japan’s tsunami, one of the first pieces of debris washed ashore the Oregon coast in June 2012.  As the debris includes materials able to stay afloat for years and even decades, a new ecological process called mega-rafting introduces foreign flotsam with new, unsuspecting native networks.  11. The Two-Headed PorpoiseNear the murky waters of Hoek Van Holland, two frantic fishermen pulled up a mysterious porpoise off the coast of the Netherlands. The species of small-toothed whale was later confirmed as the first ever case of conjoined twin porpoises, marking the tenth known case of sea mammals consisting of whales and dolphins, also known as cetaceans.  10. The Faceless Fish In the depths of the Tasman sea, somewhere between Tasmania and Australia, the faceless fish was discovered. This forty-centimeter-long creature with an alien-like body since has scientists baffled. As the mouth is situated on the underside of the fish, one cannot detect any form of eyes when looking at the animal head-on. In addition, no mouth, nose, or gills can be seen on the faceless beast. Rather, it looks like a long, submarine-shaped animal rendering the two rear-ends of a fish. 9. The Beluga hybrid Another strange find in the wake of devastation was a strange and scary hybrid creature. In what resembles a cross between a fierce shark and bubbly-faced beluga whale, researchers deemed this creature one of the most unusual finds ever.8. The Oarfish Oracle  Along one of Philippine's pristine beaches washed up several ten-foot-long sea serpents. In several cases, people have had sightings of oarfish prior to an earthquake and tsunami— such as those occurring in Japan, Chile, Haiti, and the Philippines. 7. The Shocked Sea Dragon This one-eyed sea dragon remains a marine mystery— for when the petrified ocean animal washed up, it had a gaping mouth and protruding eye that cause speculators to assume the tsunami had shocked and terrified the unsuspecting creature. This baffling beast bore the similarity of a tiny dragon, and when turned over, only revealed the one, bulging eye. To this day scientists have not disclosed what this floating victim might be. 6. The Unidentified Blob Soon after the devastating tsunami struck Japan, a giant boulder of blubber washed ashore a beach in Indonesia. In the days following its arrival, the beast began to decompose as spectators congregated around the creature— many were horrified of the massive animal which bore no resemblance to anything ever seen before. 5. The Strange Floating ObjectAccording to a reporter telecasting live after the 2011 tsunami, a suspicious floating object began swimming at what he claims: “The speed of light.” 4. A Freak in the Street When an unknown sea creature was found in the middle of a street following a tsunami, researchers wondered why no other fish or sea life accompanied the remains. The entity was too different to be a whale or shark, yet the freakish fish bore a slight resemblance to both. According to witnesses, investigators took the creature captive and never released any further detail on its identity. 3.The Mysterious Mutant Fish Rumors spread that the aftermath of such destruction had created some mutant marine creatures as well. After a fisherman sourced a bulbous sea beast with no teeth and a bulging brain in comparison to its small body. 2. The DogfishThe creature appeared prehistoric with almost tusk-like appendages which protruded from its gaping mouth. Researchers seized the sea creature and no word has surfaced since. 1. The unidentified flying creature This flying-smoke creature portrayed characteristics never been seen, with its ability to rise up into the air like smoke before vanishing altogether. As water levels rose during the tsunami and victims rushed to grab their video recorders, the strange object appeared to be jumping from one rock to the other before making its ascent into the air.",PT11M1S,2/19/19,2/19/19,212312,What Lurks Below,/channel/UCrLg26XASQO2rfheSFV-F6w,UCrLg26XASQO2rfheSFV-F6w,20,_ZyFXPhCpak

"Pirate Hunting - Operation Atalanta in the Indian Ocean (Documentary, 2010)",Entertainment,3711259,"10,496","1,767","Film starts at 0:11. How much do we really know about Somali piracy? Several compelling stories from the world of piracy lend a new and unique perspective on this issue. Flimmer Film AS has managed to get on board the KNM Fritjof Nansen during the three first weeks of their six-month mission, operating as an on-board camera team.Subscribe to wocomoDOCS: https://goo.gl/sBmGkpFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wocomo© 2010, Licensed by First Hand FilmsThis synopsis is written while on board, after having had three encounters with Somali pirates, and several interceptions of suspected skiffs. Compared to other military vessels in the EU and NATO forces in the Bay of Aden, the Fritjof Nansen is regularly involved with such skirmishes. We have also acquired exclusive rights to rare footage from a real-life hostage situation. The well-known pirate incident on the Russian MV Faina was filmed with a hidden mobile phone, smuggled in by one of the crew members’ underwear.Piracy is large-scale theft, but when risk hits one of the aortas of global shipping trade, the Somalian pirates aren’t the only ones making big bucks. Huge investments and expensive cargoes are at stake. We show you how the piracy capital of the world is not necessarily Eyl in Somalia, but just as much London. Here, we find insurance companies, lawyers, specialized negotiators and professional ransom handlers. It’s all big business, and these surrounding industries are arguably even more lucrative than the Somalian pirates' activities themselves.Shipping companies that are wary of the EU and reluctant to cash out the extra insurance premiums might make other, more controversial arrangements: security companies are now also making inlets into the industry. Here, we see footage from a secret training camp of one such company. The bill for this growing, lucrative pirate industry? The shipping companies pass the cost increases onto customers, with insurance companies following suit. Everyone else seems to win; the pirates, the navy, the lawyers, the insurance companies and maybe even the shipping companies – all but normal people and, of course, a few sailors.",PT58M11S,6/2/18,6/2/18,111324,wocomoDOCS,/channel/UCeo9P_uFXJOi4v0XvHczGRQ,UCeo9P_uFXJOi4v0XvHczGRQ,19,82S914f4sR4
China's problems with the Uyghurs (Documentary from 2014 in HD),Education,2212153,"15,764","3,371","For the first time, a French director-journalist will join an official trip to the heart of one of the most secret regions in China: Xinjiang. Unstable and by far the most volatile province in the country, it’s a unique opportunity to visit an area that’s normally out of bounds to tourists.Subscribe to wocomoDOCS: https://goo.gl/sBmGkpLocated in the far northwest of the People’s Republic, on the borders of central Asia, Xinjiang is the scene of frequent clashes between the Chinese authorities and the Uyghurs, Turkish-speaking Muslims who, like their Tibetan neighbors, reject the colonization of their territory. Going beyond the Uyghur problem (which gets less media coverage than the unrest in neighbouring Tibet) the aim of this documentary is to decipher the propaganda that is currently being put out by the Chinese, who are trying to convince the world, and Chinese tour operators in particular, that the region is a haven of peace, a heaven on earth suitable for mass tourism. Thanks to reliable contacts amongst the organisers of this “Chinese tour” and the help of diasporas based in Europe and Central Asia, and thanks also to accounts given here for the first time by Turkish-speaking Muslims and footage of the most recent revolts, we’ll be able to draw a parallel between a slick, consensual tour and the distress of an entire race. To get a better understanding of the extent to which everything here is built on lies and propaganda, we shall show videos shot by the minorities themselves as well as their accounts.

Yemen: The Last Lunch | Al Jazeera World,News & Politics,47504,317,20,"Details surrounding the political assassination of Ibrahim al-Hamdi, president of North Yemen, in 1977 are stranger than fiction.Al-Hamdi, viewed by many as a reformer and modernist, came to power in a bloodless coup in June 1974 at a time when Yemen was divided into two countries: North Yemen, where al-Hamdi was president and Marxist South Yemen. As a moderniser, al-Hamdi pushed for Yemeni unification and was due to travel to Aden to meet with his southern counterpart in October 1977.Two days before that meeting was due to take place, al-Hamdi was invited to lunch at the home of his army commander Ahmed al-Ghashmi. On arrival, al-Hamdi was taken past the dignitaries and brought to a room where on the floor lay the body of his brother. According to an eyewitness, al-Hamdi was then murdered at the scene.The exact details of his death remain a mystery. Some claim he was shot dead in a drive-by shooting. A more lurid account places al-Hamdi's body and that of his brother alongside those of two young French women, who some speculate may have been spies, high class escorts, or both. While nobody was ever charged with the murder, the list of suspects included two future Yemeni presidents, tribal enemies opposed to al-Hamdi's erosion of their power and forces loyal to neighbouring Saudi Arabia, who vigorously denied involvement in the murder.The assassination of al-Hamdi still resonates today. More than 40 years on, his family and supporters still search for answers. And with few witnesses left alive, calls for accountability and closure are more pressing than ever.Yemen: The Last Lunch traces the events leading up to Ibrahim al-Hamdi's murder and how his death steered the course of a country deeply divided.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",PT47M16S,1/29/20,1/29/20,13311,Yemen,/results?search_query=Yemen&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKWDd3MGZLemJBeFlScm5ldWZqY3A4Wkk%253D,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,1dsGeHxzzW8
