"Justice: What's The Right Thing To Do? Episode 01 ""THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDER""",Education,11311476,"90,886","2,460","To register for the 2015 course, visit https://www.edx.org/course/justice-ha.... PART ONE: THE MORAL SIDE OF MURDERIf you had to choose between (1) killing one person to save the lives of five others and (2) doing nothing even though you knew that five people would die right before your eyes if you did nothing—what would you do?  What would be the right thing to do?  Thats the hypothetical scenario Professor Michael Sandel uses to launch his course on moral reasoning.  After the majority of students votes for killing the one person in order to save the lives of five others, Sandel presents three similar moral conundrums—each one artfully designed to make the decision more difficult.  As students stand up to defend their conflicting choices, it becomes clear that the assumptions behind our moral reasoning are often contradictory, and the question of what is right and what is wrong is not always black and white. PART TWO: THE CASE FOR CANNIBALISMSandel introduces the principles of utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, with a famous nineteenth century legal case involving a shipwrecked crew of four.  After nineteen days lost at sea, the captain decides to kill the weakest amongst them, the young cabin boy, so that the rest can feed on his blood and body to survive.   The case sets up a classroom debate about the moral validity of utilitarianism—and its doctrine that the right thing to do is whatever produces ""the greatest good for the greatest number.""",PT54M56S,2009-09-04,2009-09-04,111423,Harvard University,/channel/UCLv7Gzc3VTO6ggFlXY0sOyw,UCLv7Gzc3VTO6ggFlXY0sOyw,18,kBdfcR-8hEY
"Grand jury indicts Ohio teen on aggravated murder charges for burned, buried baby",News & Politics,59983,440,37,"CARLISLE, Ohio (WKRC) - Brooke Skylar Richardson had a promising future. The 18-year-old graduated from Carlisle High School and she was headed to the University of Cincinnati to study in the Fall.Many who knew her are still trying to wrap their heads around what happened. Kasey Isaacs graduated two years before Richardson. ""She was a pretty decent girl from what I saw on school. She didn't really bother anybody. It's crazy,"" Isaacs said. Friday, a grand jury indicted Richardson. She faces charges of aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, endangering children, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse.Richardson was previously charged with reckless homicide in the case. Investigators found bones buried at the property on Eagle Ridge Drive in July. They initially thought they were those of a stillborn baby that had been buried 10-12 weeks before they were discovered.""I'm currently pregnant and I could not put myself in her shoes. There's no way. I just couldn't,"" said Isaacs.Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell says Richardson gave birth in early May at the family home on Eagle Ridge, killing the baby shortly afterwards. On July 14th, after getting a tip, investigators found the remains burned and buried behind the family's Carlisle home. Originally, investigators believed the remains were of a stillborn, but the prosecutor says testing showed that the baby was born alive.""I didn't expect this really at all especially around here. It was a definite shocked to see all of the police and all of the news crews come up and then all of the information that got released. It came as a great shock and it's very disturbing,"" said neighbor Sam Jeffries, who is familiar with the family.The prosecutor says more will come out after the trial. As for a motive, he believes from Richardson's perspective, keeping the baby was not an option.""Skylar and her family, particularly her mother, were pretty obsessed with external appearances and how things appear to the outside world and you have a situation where she's a cute, recent graduate. She was a cheerleader, a described 'good girl' by her attorney,"" said Fornshell.Richardson is expected in court on Monday. The prosecutor says he will likely seek a high bond considering the seriousness of the charges. The prosecutor did have the option of seeking the death penalty, but has chosen not to in this case.",PT2M58S,2017-08-10,2017-08-10,113113,LOCAL 12,/channel/UC673WfesrYoCgG9VsekGlEQ,UC673WfesrYoCgG9VsekGlEQ,20,-7A9Ip_1DWM

Murder in the First Degree Inside the Arias Trial HD commercial free,News & Politics,1542779,"5,828",668,"A very decent overview, especially considering the brevity of broadcast time, in the cold-blooded murder of Travis Alexander - by sociopath murderer Jodi Arias on 06/04/08.The quick gloss-over after the ever-so-competent Dr. Janeen DeMarte's testimony (which might possibly leave a casual observer who hadn't followed the trial, with a belief that her findings were possibly discredited in some way) - is just bad, though.  It was completely the opposite.  This had to do with only a brief time to wrap the last 3-4 weeks of trial up in 5 minutes.VERDICT: State of Arizona vs. Jodi Arias (for the Murder of Travis Alexander).COUNT 1: First Degree Murder (Premeditated) GUILTY: 5 jurorsCOUNT 1: Felony Murder (no votes)COUNT 1: BOTH First Degree Premeditated AND Felony Murder GUILTY: 7 JurorsJUSTICE4TRAVIS (and family) AT LAST!""If I ever hurt Travis - if I ever KILLED Travis - I would BEG FOR the Death Penalty"" ~ Jodi Arias 07-15-08""If I did that, I'd be fully ready to face the consequences...I'm all for the ten commandments - thou shalt not kill."" ~ Jodi Arias 07-15-08",PT41M55S,2013-05-12,2013-05-12,113422,whatchutalkinbout,/channel/UCpmHHQU6SnHp2HETZIQWX3w,UCpmHHQU6SnHp2HETZIQWX3w,20,A2XvzoNqUh8
