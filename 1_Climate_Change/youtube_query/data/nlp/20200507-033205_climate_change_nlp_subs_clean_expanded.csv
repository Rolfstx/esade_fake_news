When the ancients looked at the sky, the\nsky was full  mystery  wonder,   the year 1066, the most important date on\nthe British calendar, there was a comet, a comet which sailed over the battlefield \nHastgs. \xa0It frightened the troops  Kg Harold,  a young man from Normy, swept\nto Engl  defeated Kg Harold at the Battle  Hastgs, creatg the modern British\nmonarchy. But the question is, where did the comet come\nfrom? \xa0What was this comet that mysteriously paved the way for the comg  the British\nmonarchy? Well, believe it or not, that same comet,\nthe very same comet that itiated the British monarchy, sailed over London once aga \n1682. \xa0This time, everyone was askg the question, ""Where do comets come f"
35,1.0,"rom? \xa0Do\nthey signal the death  the kg? \xa0Why do we have messengers from heavens  the sky?""\n\xa0Well, one man dared to penetrate the secrets  comets,  that was Isaac Newton. \xa0In\nfact, when Isaac Newton was only 23 years old, he stumbled upon the universal force\n gravitation. Accordg to one story, he was walkg on\nhis estate  Woolsthorpe,  he saw an apple fall. \xa0And then Isaac Newton saw the moon,\n then he asked the key question which helped to unlock the heavens. \xa0If apples falls,\ndoes the moon also fall? \xa0And the answer was, ""Yes."" \xa0And answer overturned thouss\n years  mystery  speculation about the motions  the heavens. \xa0 moon is\n freefall, just like an apple. \xa0 moon is constantly fallg toward the earth. \xa0It\ndoesn\'t hit the earth, because it sps around the earth,  the earth is round, but it\'s\nactg under a force, a force  gravity. So Newton immediately tried to work out the\nmathematics  he realized that the mathematics  the 1600\'s was not suf"
36,1.0,"ficient to work out\nthe motion  a fallg moon. \xa0So what did Isaac Newton do? \xa0When he was 23 years old,\nnot only did he stumble upon the force  gravity, but he also created calculus. \xa0In\nfact, he created calculus at the rate at which you learn it, when you are a freshman  college.\n\xa0And why did he create calculus? \xa0To calculate the motion  a fallg moon. \xa0 mathematics\n his age was capable  calculatg the trajectories  objects movg under an verse\nsquare force field,  that\'s what Isaac Newton did. \xa0He worked out the motion \nthe moon. \xa0And then he realized that if he understs the moon, he also understs\nthe motion  the planets  the solar system. And Isaac Newton vented a new telescope.\n\xa0It was the reflectg telescope  he was trackg the motion  this comet. Well, it turns out that everyone was talkg\nabout the comet, cludg a rather wealthy Englishman by the name  Edmund Haley. So Edmund Haley, beg a wealthy merchant, decided to make\na trip to Cambridge to tal"
37,1.0,"k to Engl\'s illustrious scientist, Sir Isaac Newton. \xa0Well, Edmund\nHaley asked Newton, ""What do you make  this comet? \xa0No one understs comets, they\'re\na mystery. \xa0y\'ve been fascatg people for centuries, for millennia, what are your\nthoughts?"" \xa0And then, I paraphrase, but Isaac Newton said somethg like this, he said,\n""Oh, that\'s easy. \xa0That comet is movg at a perfect ellipse. \xa0It\'s movg  an verse\nsquare force field. \xa0I\'ve been trackg it every day with my reflectg telescope \nthe path  that comet conforms to my mathematics exactly."" \xa0And  course, we don\'t know what\nEdmund Haley\'s reaction was, but I paraphrase, he must have said somethg like this, he\nsaid, ""For God\'s sake, man, why don\'t you publish the greatest work  all  scientific\nhistory? \xa0If correct, you have decoded the secret  the stars, the secret  the heavens.\n\xa0Nobody understs where comets come from."" And then Newton responded  said, ""Oh,\nwell, it costs too much. \xa0I mean, I\'m"
38,1.0," not a wealthy man, it would cost too much to summarize\nthis calculus that I\'ve vented  to work out all the motion  the stars."" \xa0And then\nHaley must have said this, he must have said, ""Mr. Newton, I am a wealthy man. \xa0I have\nmade my fortune  commerce. \xa0I will pay for the publication  the greatest scientific\nwork  any language."" \xa0And it was Prcipia.  prcipals, the mathematical prcipals\nthat guide the heavens. Believe it or not, this is perhaps one \nthe most important works ever written by a human beg  the 100,000 years sce we\nevolved from Africa. \xa0Realize that this book sets to motion a physics  the universe.\n\xa0Forces that control the motion  the planets, forces which can be calculated, forces which\ngovern the motion  cannonballs, rockets, pebbles, everythg that moves, moves accordg\nto the laws  motion  the calculus  Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, even today, when we launch our space\nprobes, we don\'t use Este\'s equations, they only apply when you get near the "
39,1.0,"speed\n light or near a black hole. \xa0We use Newton\'s laws  gravity. \xa0y are so precise that\nwhen we shoot a space probe right past the rgs  Saturn, we use exactly the same equations\nthat Isaac Newton unraveled  the 1600\'s. That\'s why we have glorious photographs\n the rgs  Saturn. \xa0That\'s why we have flyby\'s right past Neptune. \xa0That\'s why\nwe\'ve been able to unravel the secrets  the solar system, compliments  the laws\n motion  Isaac Newton. So what Newton did was not only did he set\nto motion the ability to calculate planets, he also set to motion a mechanics. \xa0Maches\nnow operated upon welldefed laws: Newton\'s three laws  motion. \xa0 first law  motion\nsays that objects  motion stay  motion forever, unless acted on by an outside force.\n\xa0You see that  an ice skatg rk. \xa0You should a puck  it goes all the way down\nforever, unless acted upon by an outside force. That\'s different from Aristotle\'s law \nmotion. \xa0Aristotle said, ""Objects  motion event"
40,1.0,"ually stop, because they get tired.""  second law  motion says, force is mass\ntimes acceleration. \xa0And that equation made possible the Industrial Revolution. \xa0Steam\nenges, locomotives, factories, maches, all  it due to the mechanics set to motion\nby Isaac Newton\'s second law  motion, force is equal to mass times acceleration. And then Newton had a third law  motion.\n\xa0For every action, there\'s an equal  opposite reaction, that\'s the law  rockets. \xa0That\'s\nwhy we have rockets that can sail to outer space. which could have been calculated by Isaac\nNewton himself. So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel\nthe first force  the universe, gravity, that number, 25,000 miles per hour, that\'s\nthe escape velocity  the earth, a number So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel\nthe first force  the universe, gravity, that set to motion the Industrial Revolution.\n\xa0A revolution which toppled the kgs  queens  Europe, which displaced feudalism,\nusherg  the modern a"

You know, when I was a kid growg up  California,\nI would see pictures  the Empire State Buildg. And I said to myself, ""How could that possibly\nbuild such a big buildg  not know that it\'s gog to fall? \xa0I mean, why doesn\'t\nit fall? \xa0y didn\'t build scale models  the thg, you couldn\'t have an Empire\nState Buildg that big to test whether it\'s gog to fall or not. \xa0How did they know\nahead  time that that buildg wouldn\'t fall? \xa0And the answer is: \xa0Newton\'s laws\n motion. In fact, today, I teach Newton\'s laws  motion,\n you can actually calculate the forces on every sgle brick  the empire state\nbuildg, usg Newton\'s second law  motion, force is mass\ntimes acceleration. When Newton unraveled\nthe force  gravity, that was the first force. Now, let\'s take a look at the\nsecond force, an even greater force which has touched all  our lives,  that is\nthe electromagnetic f"
42,1.0,"orce. Ever sce humans saw lightng bolts light\nup the sky, ever sce they were terrified by the sound  thunder, they\'ve been askg,\n""Do the gods propel lighteng bolts  create thunder? \xa0Are they angry at us?"" Scientists began to\nrealize that the lightng bolts  the thunder can be duplicated on the earth. \xa0That\nwe can actually create mi lightng bolts usg electricity. But it wasn\'t until the 1800\'s that fally\nwe beg to unlock the second great force which rules the universe, the electromagnetic\nforce. Michael Faraday would give Christmas lectures  London, fascatg everyone from\nadults to children. \xa0And he would demonstrate the credible properties  electricity. Some people, for example, ask a simple question.\n\xa0If you\'re  a car or an airplane, you get hit by a lighteng bolt, why don\'t you all\nget electrocuted? \xa0Why don\'t you all die? Well, Faraday answered the question. \xa0He\nwould create a cage.\xa0He would walk to this steel cage, electrify it, \nhe wouldn\'t get"
43,1.0," electrocuted at all. \xa0That\'s called a Faraday cage  every time you walk\nto \xa0metal structure, you get shielded by this metal object. Well, what Michael Faraday did was, he helped to unleash the second great revolution\nwith somethg calls Faraday\'s Law. A movg wire  a magnetic\nfield, has this electrons pushed, creatg an electrical current. That simple idea unleashed the electric revolution. And that\'s why we have hydroelectric generators, dams that produce enormous amounts  power, That\'s why people build nuclear power plants. That\'s why we have electricity  this room right now! On a very small scale, you use that  your\nbicycle. \xa0When you put a bicycle lamp on your bicycle, the turng  the wheel sps\na magnet. \xa0 magnet then pushes electrons  a wire  that\'s why electricity lights\nup  your bicycle lamp. So  other words, electricity  magnetism were unified to\na sgle force. \xa0We once thought that electricity  magnetism were separate. \xa0Now we know\nthey are  fact th"
44,1.0,"e same force. So if a movg magnet can create an electric\nfield, this means that a movg electric field can create a magnetic field. \xa0But if they\ncan create each other, why can\'t they oscillate  create a wave? \xa0So that movg electric\nfields create magnetic fields, create electric fields, create magnetic fields, fitum\nto create a wave? Well, around the time  the American Civil\nWar, a mathematical physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, calculated, usg the work  Faraday,\nthe velocity  this wave. And  one  the greatest breakthroughs\n all time, James Clerk Maxwell calculated the velocity  this wave  found out it\nwas the velocity  light. \xa0And then he made this credible discovery: this is light.\n\xa0That\'s what light is. \xa0It doesn\'t by accident travel at the speed  electricity, it is\nlight itself. wave,  that wave is called light. And the equations were written down by James\nClerk Maxwell. \xa0Unfortunately, Michael Faraday And the equations were written down by James\nClerk M"
45,1.0,"axwell. \xa0Unfortunately, Michael Faraday himself did not have a formal education. \xa0He\ncould not put to mathematical form his own work. \xa0James Clerk Maxwell was a theoretical\nphysicist, just like myself. \xa0He wrote down the mathematical physics  oscillatg electric\nfields  magnetic fields  they are called Maxwell\'s equations. \xa0se equations have\nto be memorized by every physicist  grad school. \xa0You cannot get your PhD without\nmemorizg these equations. \xa0Every engeer deals with radar  radio has to memorize these equations. \xa0And so, if you go to Berkley,\nwhere I got my PhD, you can buy a tshirt which says, ""In the begng God said, the\nfourdimensional divergence  an antisymmetric, second rank tensor equals zero,  there\nwas light.

This is the ternet. \xa0 ternet is a\nsimple byproduct  the electromagnetic force. And\nyou can see that where there is the ternet, there is prosperity. \xa0re is science, there\'s\nentertament, there\'s econo"

Now, let\'s talk about the next great forces\nwhich rule the universe. \xa0We talked about gravity, which allows us to calculate the\nmotion  the planets. \xa0 mechanics created by Newton helped to unleash the Industrial\nRevolution. \xa0Michael Faraday worked out the electromagnetic force, which gave us the wonders\n the electric age. \xa0And now, let\'s talk about the nuclear age, the stars  the sun.\n\xa0People have been fascated by the sun, Apollo was the god that strode across the\nheavens  his fiery chariot. \xa0But hey, when you calculate how long coal or oil will burn\nlike the sun, you realize that  just a few hundred years, the sun would burn to a crisp.\n\xa0So what could possibly last for billions  years? \xa0re must be a new force, a nuclear\nforce. Este  others helped to unravel the\nsecret  the stars. \xa0 nuclear force comes  two types, weak "
49,1.0," strong. \xa0 weak nuclear force governs radioactive decay.  strong nuclear force is one  the strongest forces  the entire universe. It\'s so strong it holds our protons together, ever sce Genesis, the begng  time.  equation which allows for the liberation  energy is Este\'s famous equation E=mc². What Este showed was that the faster you move, the heavier you get. So your weight is not a constant. When you move very rapidly you get heavier, somethg which we measure every day  the laboratory. Now, this means\nthat the energy  motion transformed to mass, because you get heavier. \xa0Now, listen\ncarefully. \xa0 faster you move, the heavier you get. \xa0Which means that the energy \nmotion, ""E"" turns to ""m"", your mass. \xa0And the relationship between E  m is very simple,\nit takes one second to write it down on a sheet  paper, it is exactly E=mc². So the nuclear force helped to expla the\nsecret  the sun. \xa0But it also created a Pora\'s box, because side the nucleus\n the atom, are par"

Hundreds, thouss  subatomic particles every time\nwe smash atoms. Now, we smash atoms usg somethg called atom smashers, or particle accelerators. I built my own particle accelerator when I was  high school. When I was  high school, I went to my mom one day  I said, ""Can\nI have permission to build a 2.3 million electron volt betatron particle accelerator  the\ngarage?"" \xa0And my mom said, ""Sure, why not? And don\'t forget to take out the garbage!"" And as a high school kid I asked for 00 pounds  transformer steel. I asked for 22 miles  cooper wire. Because I wanted to create a six kilowatter, 10,000 gauss magnetic field, to energize my atom smasher. With 22 miles  copper wire, how could you wd it? We did it on the high school football field.

I plugged my ears, I closed my eyes, I turned on the power,  I heard this huge cracklg sound as six kilowatts  power surged through my capacitor bank  then I heard a ""pop pop pop"" sound as I blew out every sgle circuit breaker  the house.  whole house was plunged  darkness. My poor mom, every time she\'d come home she\'d see the lights flicker  die. And she must\'ve wondered ""why couldn\'t I have a son who plays baseball?"" Why can\'t he learn basket ball? And for god\'s sake why can\'t he fd a nice Japanese girl?"" I mean, why does he have to build these maches  the garage? Well, these maches that I built  my garage earned the attention  a physicist Edward Teller, father  the hydrogen bomb. "
52,1.0,"And he arranged for me to get a scholarship to . And my career got a head start! He knew exactly what I was dog. I didn\'t have to expla to him that I was experimentg with antimatter. I was creatg antielectrons  my mom\'s garage,  usg atom smashers to eventually create beams  antimatter. Antimatter is the opposite  matter. It has an opposite charge. So an electron has negative charge.  positron, or antielectron, has positive charge. This means that you can now create antimolecules  antiatoms. Antihydrogen was made at CERN, outside Geneva, Switzerl And also at Fermilab outside Chicago Where you have antielectrons circulatg around antiprotons. And  Brookhaven ional Laboratory on Long Isl just recently they detected antihelium! We have two antiprotons with two antineutrons to create antihelium. For every piece  matter there is a counterpart made out  antimatter. And when the two collide, by the way, it releases the greatest energy source  the universe. It is 100 percent conversion  matter"
53,1.0," to energy by Este\'s equations E=mc squared. Inside the nucleus  the atom we have particles upon particles when you smash them apart. In the 1950\'s we were drowng  subatomic particles. In fact, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father  the atomic bomb, once made a statement. He declared that ""the Nobel Prize  physics should go to the physicist who does not discover a new particle this year."" That how many particles were beg discovered. So, let\'s talk about the Particle Zoo. Right now, we physicists have unlocked hundreds, thouss  subatomic particles. And we\'ve been able to piece them together to a jigsaw puzzle. It\'s called the ""stard model."" It has 36 quarks, 19 free parameters, 3 generations  quarks no rhyme, no reason, but this is the most fundamental basis  reality that we physicists have been able to construct.

54,1.0,"ce missg is called the HiggsBoson. We expect to fd it. We want to create a higher version  this theory  that theory, we thk, is strg theory.

You see, Este\'s equations break down  the stant  the big b  the center  a black hole.  two most terestg places  the universe are beyond our reach usg Este\'s equations. We need a higher theory,  that\'s where strg theory comes . Strg theory takes you before the  Bang, before Genesis itself. And what does strg theory say? It says that there is a multiverse  univer"
56,1.0,"ses. Where did the  Bang come from? Well, Este\'s equations give us this compellg picture that we are like sects on a soap bubble. A gigantic soap bubble which is expg.  we are trapped like flies on fly paper, we can\'t escape the soap bubble  that\'s called the  Bang ory. Strg theory says there should be other bubbles out there  a multiverse  bubbles. When two universes collide it can form another universe. When a universe splits  half it can create two universes,  that, we thk, is the  Bang.   Bang is caused by either the collision  universes or by the fissiong  universes. If there are other dimensions, if there are other universes, can we go between universes? Well that,  course, is very hard, but ice  Wonderl gives us a possibility that maybe one day we might create a wormhole between universes.

We can actually see this  strg theory.  question is: how practical is it to go through one  these thgs? We don\'t know. In fact there\'s a debate among physicists today, Stephen Hawkg, many physicists are jumpg to the game  tryg to figure out whether it\'s physically possible to go all the way through a wormhole. Because if you could, then you might be able to use this as a time mache. Sce strg theory is a theory  everythg, it\'s also a theory  time. And time maches are allowed  Este\'s equations, but to build one is extremely difficult. Far more energy is required than a simple Delorean with plutonium. You know, trillions  years from now the universe is gog to get awfully cold. We thk the universe is headed for a big freeze. Stars will blk out, stars will cease to twkle,  the universe will be so big it\'ll be very cold. At that pot all telligent life  the universe must die. "

We are now enterg the realm  science fiction, but at least now we have equations equations  strg theory which will now allow us to calculate if it is possible to go through a wormhole, to go to another universe where it\'s warmer,  perhaps we can start all over aga. If you were to summarize the march  physics through the last 10,000 years it would be the distillation  the laws  nature to four fundamental forces. Gravity, electricity  magnetism,  the two nuclear forces. But then the question is ""is there a fifth force?"" A force beyond the forces we can measure  the laboratory. And believe it or not there are physicists who have looked very carefully for a fifth force. Some people thk maybe it\'s psychic phenomena. Maybe it\'s telepathy. Maybe it\'s somethg called psi power. Maybe it\'s the power  the md. Maybe consciousness! Well, I\'m a physicist"
59,1.0,". We believe  testg theories to make sure they are falsifiable  reproducible. We want to make sure that on dem your theory works every sgle time without exception. And if your theory fails one time, It\'s wrong. In other words, Este\'s theory has to work every sgle time without exception. One time Este\'s theory is proven to be wrong, the whole theory is wrong. Well, so far we can reproduce these four physical theories, but a fifth theory cannot be reproduced. We\'ve looked for it. Some people thk that maybe a fifth force may be short range. Like, not over the nucleus  an atom, but rangg over several feet. And we can\'t fd any. We physicists  the last ten years have discovered a new energy source larger than the galaxy itself. Dark energy. Realized  our universe today 73 percent  our universe, matter  energy, 73 percent is  the form  dark energy.  energy  nothg! That\'s what\'s blowg the galaxies farther  farther apart. That\'s the energy  the  Bang itself. Kids ask the question, ""If t"
60,1.0,"he universe banged, what made it bang?"" And the answer is dark energy. 73 percent  the universe\'s energy is dark energy. 23 percent is dark matter. Dark matter is visible matter. If I held it  my h it would go right through my h. It holds the galaxy together. 23 percent  the universe is dark matter. Stars made out  hydrogen  helium make up four percent  the universe. And then what about us? We, the higher elements. We made out  oxygen, carben, nitrogen, tungsten, iron We make up .03 percent  the universe. In other words, we are the exception.  universe is maly made out  dark energy.  universe is maly made out  dark matter. Overwhelmg the stars, overwhelmg the galaxies  fact. Now what is dark matter, which makes up 23 percent  the universe? No one knows. Strg theory gives us a clue, but there\'s no defitive answer. So  other words, for you young aspirg physicists out there  the audience, You may be sayg to yourself right now, ""Why should I go to physics? Because you guys already have a"

In the past ten years we have come to the realization that most  the universe is dark. And there\'s a whole shelf full  Nobel Prizes for the young people who can figure out the secret  dark matter  dark energy. Let me give some advice to you if you are a young physicist, perhaps just gettg out  high school You have dreams  beg Este, you have dreams  workg on strg theory  thgs like that  then you hit freshman physics. Let me be blunt: We physicists flunk most student takg elementary physics. And we\'re more or less encouraged to do so by the engeerg department. We don\'t want to tra engeers who make bridges that fall down. We don\'t want to create engeers that create skyscrapers that fall over. re\'s a bottom le: you have to know the laws  mec"
62,1.0,"hanics. So before you can work with the laws  Este, you have to work with\nthe laws  friction, levers, pulleys \ngears. As a consequence we have a very high flunkout rate  elementary physics. So if you\'re a young physicist graduatg from high school with stars  your eyes,  you encounter freshman physics for the first time, watch out! If you have a rough time, that\'s the way it is. I started out my life as an experimental physicist. n I went to   then I talked to my adviser, one  the world\'s greatest experiment physicists, Pressor Pound And he told me maybe it\'s time to give it a rest. He said to me, ""Your skills are much better suited to what you love the most, which is theory."" ""Mathematics.  world  higher dimensions."" And I realized that he was probably right.  thg about physics, or science that really trigues me the most is to fd the most fundamental basis for everythg Rather than tryg to massage a theory, or make a theory prettier, Why not fd out why it works?

64,0.0,here's a scary thought what if we can't stop climate change most  the talk about climate change has been about reducg the emissions we're gog to make but what about the emissions we've already made so if we cut all emissions to zero tomorrow it could be that the world still warms up quite a lot over this century because  what are called carbon feedbacks sce the begng  the Industrial Revolution we've already added 531 billion tons  carbon emissions to the atmosphere that has led to a roughly one  a half degree rise  average global surface temperatures so far which  turn is causg ice caps to melt sea levels to rise  has been lked to extreme droughts  storms we need to have technologies which allow us to have a high stard  livg while beg  carbon balances  we have done it with clean air  this country  I thk we can also do it with stoppg climate change cleang up our existg nests is gog to be hard expensive  controversial but it's also gog to be necessary fortunately some people are already

66,0.0, the question is can you pull co2 out  the atmosphere  you look at a tree  the answer is yes you can he wants to make a synthetic version that works even better certaly you can pull up plow over the horse but you're better f gettg a tractor this is his tractor Lackner steam has been workg on different versions  this technology for more than a decade the key component is this papery material which is embedded with a res that can absorb carbon dioxide from the air our take on this material  our twist  our discovery is that it also has a strong affity for carbon dioxide especially when it's  a dry state now I have sort  a spoon I can grab the co2  it crucially the material also lets go  co2 dunk it  water or expose it to high humidity  it releases the carbon dioxide for collection it can be pumped underground fed to greenhouses or to algae for biuel or perhaps  the future even used to make carbonbased materials once the co2 is gone you can dry the membrane  the air  reuse it Lackner expec

And then, the first batch  really embarrassg\nemployee emails leaked.

Boeg was a magnificent company, who made,  my opion, the\nbest airplanes  the world, until some  these\nrecent cultural changes, which all came from\npressure to  ,  bad management. You know, over the years, Boeg was this tremendously important  novative company, but it wasn\'t necessarily a great stock. In 1997, Boeg merged\nwith McDonnell Douglas, another aerospace  defense giant.

Further evidence  a move away from engeerg prowess  novation, to prit,\nwas Boeg\'s decision to move company headquarters to Chicago, when Boeg\'s jet manufacturg  airplane designers were  Seattle. Probably the biggest motivation was to send a message to the  that this was a company\nthat was not gog to make vestment decisions\non the basis  legacy, or heritage, or anythg like that, but rather, purely make\nvestment decisions on the basis  returns,  by movg to a place\nwhere there were no legacy loyalties, no heritage\nproduction facilities, they were sendg that message. And it also started to shape how Boeg viewed its own ternal vestments  thgs like airplane programs, tremendously important as the company started planng for what\nbecame the 787 Dreamler.

For the 787, Boeg attempted a new system for designg the aircraft. Instead  dog everythg  house, it would outsource much  the plane\'s design  manufacturg\nto its biggest suppliers. It was gonna be about outsourcg, outsourcg to the places where we could produce thgs more cheaply, as opposed to the fest, best, safest airplanes  the world, which is what Boeg made for decades. This works for runng\nshoes, ladies garments, cell phones, hard drives,\ntegrated circuits, it works for everybody, it\'ll\nwork for you,  I thought \'No, it won\'t.\' Boeg had never done a plane\nusg the system before, this was very different from Boeg controllg the processes itself,  it did not go well. We launched the 787, the\nworst I could thk  was that we\'d be three months late, which is a shootg fense at Boeg. It wasn\'t three months late,\nit was three years late, it wasn\'t "

And the executive said \' busess model is fe,\nwe just didn\'t execute it.\' Every new airplane has growg pas, especially those that kd  push the edge  the\nenvelope  technology. Eventually, Boeg would fix many  the 787\'s issues,  the Dreamler slowly\nstarted to brg  big returns,  with a pritable plane, Boeg looked at other measures to boost its returns to shareholders. re\'s different ways \ngettg your prit up, so one is just that you make\nthe best product imagable,  everybody wants to buy it,  so your sales go up,  you make more money on that plane.  other is that you do\nfancial engeerg.

And the math is really\nsimple to underst, if you have fewer shares\ntradg, absent all else, the price goes up, the shares worth more, they get a nice return\non their vestment. Boeg\'s stock was on the rise,  by 2015, new CEO Dennis Muilenburg would ramp the program up even more. From 201 to 2019,\nBoeg would repurchase about 38 billion  its own shares. y went from a relatively\nnormal percentage, somethg like 30%, to over 90%  cash beg returned to vestors.

Buyg back shares, \npayg huge dividends, while you\'re layg f senior engeers to hire cheap labor \nIndia, that\'s a sickness.

Around the same time all\n this was happeng, Boeg was sellg record\nnumbers  its newest plane, the 737 Max.  737 Max was born out \na competition with Airbus.  aviation dustry is a duopoly between Boeg  Airbus, with the two giants controllg almost all  the jetler market.

So Boeg had to do the same thg, if Boeg didn\'t act, or waited too long, they could lose significant market share. American Airles called Boeg  said \'We\'re gonna buy 00 planes, \' they will all be Airbus \'unless you can match their fuel economy, \' the fact that no\npilot trag is required, \'it\'s identical to their\nother Airbus models.\' And the Boeg CEO said \'No no no no, we\'ll match that, \'we want half that order.\' With the Max, Boeg\nwas also tryg to shake the image  competence\nthat had followed the 787 debacle, so there was a lot  pressure there, to show that the, \'Hey, look, we can design planes, \' we can meet deadles with the Max.\' And to their credit,\nwith the Max, they did.

Today, I have the entire outdoors\n  an door settg. That is really very fulfillg. In the wee hours at night, we still have\n concierge teams roamg around. What happens at night is that\n we’d look out for arrival guests, guests who are lost,\n who need our help. We also look out for guests\n who are sleepg. Yes, we need to check on them\n from time to time, so that they do not\n miss their respective flights. Excuse me.  guests  the day time\n are much more active. y have a lot more questio"
223,1.0,"ns\n  enquiries, as compared to the guests at night\n who are much more sleepy. Usually, they won\'t ask so many\n questions at that time  the night. After hours, when our\n concierge counter is closed, if we fd a lost item, we\'ll h it over to our Jewel operations\n manager, who will file a \'found\' report. Mostly, we\'d fd gadgets\n like laptops, iPads,   particular, cell phones. When I was at Level 2 North,\n I found a wallet. re was around $700\n side the wallet,  the guest was very happy\n that I found the wallet. People thk that Jewel\n is very quiet at night. And yes, we do have\n fewer crowds  the eveng. But  the wee hours, there\'s actually\n a lot  activities that are still gog on. For example, the matenance team is still\n servicg  cleang our Ra Vortex  other attractions  Jewel. re’s also the lscapg team who is workg on\n our lscapg features. For us, Jewel actually\n comes alive after 10pm because the work that we have to do,\n takg care  the plants, has to happen after vis"
224,1.0,"itors\n have left the garden. It\'s almost as if the garden\n is alive 2 hours. When everybody else is asleep, we come to life\n  start matag the plants, makg sure everythg is good\n for the next day. We break to small teams. A group  people does the prung, some people hle\n the sect sprayg,  some hle the plant washg. Spray it evenly, make sure all parts \n the fern column get the water. We don’t want excessive water\n on one side. Spread it out evenly. To date, Jewel has been receivg,\n on average, 250,000 to 300,000 daily visitors. That number contues to grow. If you look through your Instagram Stories,\n Facebook feed, social media, you’ll defitely see our hero shots, our Shiseido Forest Valley\n  our HSBC Ra Vortex. se are the two attractions\n that people will defitely come for.  HSBC Ra Vortex\n lightsound show will be startg soon. Before every lightsound show, we will do what we call\n the preshow checks. This is to make sure\n all the equipment  systems that are supposed to be "
225,1.0,"runng\n are functiong correctly. What we do is make sure the pump\n is runng with the normal range. This is to ensure that there is\n sufficient water flow to the acrylic sk. This is our ma water tank. This is where\n all the water collects. So from Basement 3, the water will\n be pumped all the way up to Level 5. Many people may not know this, but the waterfall water itself\n is actually treated, so it’s very clean. People come from all over Sgapore,\n  even from foreign countries, to view this unique  iconic feature\n that Jewel has to fer. We have to deliver at our end, to make sure that the guests get to enjoy\n the full lightsound show. Before the show, the team  I will go down to the site to do the preshow checks. Are the projectors turned on? We make sure that\n all the speakers are turned on too. We make sure all the pumps\n are  workg condition. Sometimes, the WiFi connection has\n a glitch, so we have to manage that. We have to fd\n the proper connection. This iPad controls t"
226,1.0,"he Ra Vortex\n  the thgs that go with it, like the fog, the lights,  all that. When I was hed the iPad,\n it stayed with me at all times. Wherever I went, whatever I did,\n it was always by my side. It’s more important\n than my mobile phone. This iPad really is\n my precious baby.  Ra Vortex system was created\n by an American consultancy, WET Design. In the begng, the American\n consultant was the only one who could hold this iPad\n  operate it. So ex  I had to work with them. We had to ga their trust over\n the course  two to three months before they actually allowed us\n to touch the iPad  control the\n Ra Vortex operations.  first day we held this iPad… I still remember the day,\n it was 13 April. ex  I, along with the consultant\n from WET, were walkg on Level 5,  the consultant felt the urge\n to go to the toilet, for some reason. That was when he hed over\n the iPad to us, an unficial hover. When he passed us the iPad,\n both  us felt very excited  we ended up takg a selfie. Ye"

One will be at the Forest Valley,\n observg the show.  other team will be down below, makg sure the servers\n  systems stay onle  are not faulty. People thk  the Ra Vortex\n as just a waterfall, but actually, there are\n many more elements to it, such as the lightg,\n the background , the speakers as well as projectors. se are thgs which the public\n won’t normally notice, but to our traed eyes,\n this is what we look out for. If everythg goes well  runs smoothly,\n we can go home  sleep easy, knowg that we have\n done our jobs properly. When I first joed,\n Jewel was still under construction. re wasn\'t any waterfall, so it didn\'t really impress me\n at that pot  time. But once they started to do\n the testg  commissiong, when they started\n to run the water feature, that was when it really struck me,\n  I thought, “This is magnificent!” For me, Jewel durg the day\n is all abo"
228,1.0,"ut runng the operations. But at night, I get this feelg\n  serenity  calmness because  its ambience. At night, it’s much more peaceful. You really get to enjoy\n the tranquillity  this place because it\'s designed\n to be like a forested area. We really get to be one with nature. Much  the work starts\n when it’s close to midnight. I want you to trim those\n that are slightly out  shape. It’s time for the olive tree\n to be given a nice haircut. One  the thgs that really\n left an impression on us was the plantg  the olive trees. That whole night, it took us six hours\n just to plant two trees because we didn\'t want any  the limbs\n or branches  the trees to break. And then, haulg them up\n from Level 1 to Level 5 was a very slow  paful process. It was a paful task. It took us a long time\n because we wanted to get it right, down to the smallest details like\n positiong the trees  such a way that gives people the best angle\n for viewg them. Here  Jewel, we have around\n 2,200 trees  "
229,1.0,"palms, 100,000 shrubs from\n around 120 different species. To source for the plants, we went\n as far as Australia, Florida, Spa, Thail, Indonesia,  Malaysia. We’ve some terestg ficus plants\n called “Ficus snake form”. We got them from . We were travellg from\n one nursery to another,  along the way,\n we saw these beautiful plants. It was never  the plantg plan,\n so we thought we\'d just get them first,  later, we would decide\n where they fit  the garden. It turned out very well,  they\n fit beautifully  the Canopy Park. We are now side\n the water sk  the Ra Vortex. This is a view  Jewel\n that not many people get to see. As with all water features, people tend to make their \'wishg well\'\n wishes  throw cos to the founta. Whenever we fd cos, we will just\n put them aside for safekeepg. You need to be here at night\n to experience this. It’s very peaceful. You really have time to observe\n the Ra Vortex  its true beauty. re’s no one obstructg the view,\n so you really get to see "
230,1.0,"how the Ra Vortex\n is such a complex system,  yet, it is so beautiful. As Experience Rangers,\n we manage the daytoday operations  all the attractions\n here on Level 5. After the park closes, we will do a\n thorough check on all  the attractions, such as the Mirror Maze. We have to check  make sure\n that there are no cracks  the mirrors, the area is clean,  the lights  sound effects\n are all workg. We just want to make sure that\n it\'s good for the next day’s operations. We’ll also do a thorough check\n  the Hedge Maze. We check for overgrown plants that may be juttg too far out\n to the pathway. If there are any, we’ll need to notify\n the lscape team to trim them. We have the walkg nets here. We will check all the ropes, make sure there are\n no sharp wires stickg out,  make sure all the\n metal components are  place. My first experience on the nets\n was pretty scary.  moment I reached the peak \n looked down, it caused me to freeze up. Luckily, I had a friend with me\n who gui"
231,1.0,"ded me through it. I wouldn\'t have made it to the end,\n if it was not for him. Most guests seem\n very confident at the start. But the moment they start to look down,\n  this is five storeys high, many would just st still\n  refuse to go down.  Experience Rangers here\n are actually quite used to it, so they will fer them\n a helpg h. I once encountered a lady who,\n right from the start, was crawlg because she was too scared. So I went over to her\n  as we got closer to the end, I saw a guy filmg us. She said, “That\'s my husb!\n He left me on my own here.” Her husb was also\n too scared to help her, so luckily, I was there for her. When I was a kid, I liked to\n spend my time at the playground because that\'s where\n all the neighbourhood kids were. That was our hangout spot. My childhood playground had a net, so  a way, I get to relive\n some  my memories here. Workg here at a giant playground\n makes me feel like a kid aga because I get to play\n without people judgg me, without "
232,1.0,"anyone askg,\n “What\'s a grownup dog at a playground?” We check the safety  the slides but at the same time, it\'s also an excuse\n to enjoy ourselves a little. After the park closes,\n when it\'s much quieter, sometimes, I will just spend a few mutes\n watchg the planes take f  l, which, I thk, is a pretty nice way\n to end the day.  difference between\n day  night flights is that we are a little busier\n on day flights  we get to teract\n with more passengers, while night flights are a little quieter\n  more tranquil. I am a very active person\n  I like freedom. As an air stewardess, flyg allows me to be at\n different places at different times,  on top  that,\n I get to teract with a lot  people across different cultures. One time, my colleagues  I\n were on board the tra. When the tra went through\n the Forest Valley  Jewel, we came across the Ra Vortex. Some travellers  the tra\n asked us what that was,  as it was also our first time seeg it,\n we were all  awe too. We burst out "
233,1.0,"laughg because\n our reaction time was so slow. It took us around\n three or five seconds before we turned around\n to answer the travellers  tell them what it was\n that we just saw. After long periods  travellg,\n flyg for over 10 hours, when we see the lights\n  Sgapore  the airport, it feels really good\n to be back home. When the capta announces\n for us to prepare for arrival, it means comg back home\n to our loved ones,  gettg to enjoy\n our own local delights. Havg travelled so ten, I’ve come to appreciate the simple thgs\n that we have  Sgapore. I remember that when I was young, the Mara Square area was mostly sea,\n but now, look at the skyle. When you see it, you\'d thk,\n ""Sgapore has really evolved  changed over the years."" I thk that at the heart  it, that\'s what Sgapore\n is really known for. We revented\n what a garden should be. With Jewel, we revented\n what an airport could be.  travel  tourism lscape\n contues to evolve. Travellers are becomg\n creasgly discerng. y"

Sgapore by day\n  Sgapore by night. Sometimes, it’s two completely\n different destations. Beyond your bars  clubs at night, it\'s also a great place\n for families at night. re was the\n Sgapore Night Festival. At Little India, there was\n the Little India Art Walk. From day to night time, you\'ll defitely fd somethg\n that you love to do here  Sgapore. When we started planng Jewel, we were very clear that we wanted it\n to be a tourism product. We wanted to put it\n on the global map. We wanted it to be a place where... If you\'re a tourist from afar, you\'d want to come to Sgapore\n because you\'ve heard  this place. And I thk we\'re really overwhelmed\n by the positive response. We never expected to have\n so many followers on Instagram, although social media\n is the thg  today. People always ask me,\"
235,1.0,"n “So, you should have a lot  pictures?” And the irony is,\n if you look through my phone, when I do have pictures,\n they\'re along the les ... “Look, this thg is crooked,”\n or “Why is the tree leang?” It’s all about what we need to fix. So I end up havg\n notsonice pictures  Jewel. Now that Jewel is complete,\n  I have less troubleshootg to do, there are more opportunities\n to take better pictures. I saw all the social media pictures\n  Jewel before I went, so I have to say that\n my expectations were pretty high when I first went to Jewel. And yet, upon seeg it up close, seeg it for myself\n with my own eyes, I was still very impressed. Sgapore has always prided itself\n on beg a garden city. Jewel is sort  like\n the climax  that. We want visitors\n comg to Sgapore  leavg Sgapore\n to have this image, that they have stepped\n to a garden city.  question I get asked most ten is,\n “Are the plants real?” I thk it’s because\n people are so surprised. y’re wonderg, “How did they\n ma"
236,1.0,"nage to get so much greenery to an door environment?” This remds me  my childhood days\n when I’d catch spiders, just for the fun  it. But actually,\n I am now lookg for pests. You can see some mealybugs which is quite common\n on door plantgs. When the team  architects\n first presented the idea for Jewel,  they showed us these beautiful\n rendergs  the lscape  all, I thought to myself,\n “Either these guys are jokg or everybody here is crazy.” To be very frank,\n I thought it was near impossible because the biggest challenge\n for growg plants door has always been light. We need to get\n the light levels correct.  key to that was choosg\n the correct glass type, a glass that allows maximum light  but cuts out the radiant heat.  Jewel glass facade\n is very terestg. It comprises more than 9,000\n different glass panels  each  them is \n different dimensions. So each panel is special.\n It has three glass layers. It keeps the heat out,\n lets the sunlight ,  allows the plants to thrive"
237,1.0,". Cleang such a\n complex glass structure requires a lot coordation\n with different parties. More importantly, the people cleang this\n have to do it quadrant by quadrant,  work their way downwards. Currently, our projects team is\n dog the ternal facade cleang. As you can see, there\'re many glass panels\n  they have to clean it one by one. It gets quite tedious. It has to be done on a regular basis\n  order to keep the place shy. A lot  the cleang\n has to be done at night because that\'s when\n the crowd level comes down. That cludes the cleang\n  periodic works, such as high dustg, cleang those light fittgs\n that cannot be tackled durg the day. You also have escalator cleang,   course,\n let’s not forget toilet cleang. We have to do a thorough\n cleang  all the toilets.  attractions that are terestg\n to clean are the Mirror Maze, the Canopy Bridge,\n as well as the  Nets.  one that\'s challengg is the  Nets\n because there are three layers  nets. It’s a challenge to retrieve the"
238,1.0," items\n or the dried leaves caught  between the nets.  Mirror Maze can\n only be cleaned at night, when the lightg is low\n  the park is closed. At times, you might walk to a mirror. Now, I am cleang the Mirror Maze,  gettg rid  fger marks. When I first started cleang\n the Mirror Maze, I lost track  the way out as I was tryg to spot  clean\n every sgle fger mark. After three days, once I overcame\n the challenges  the place, it no longer posed a problem for me. Our central kitchen starts\n really early  the morng. We start at 2am,\n before anyone is up. We make all our kueh,\n each one is dividually hmade. y are hcrafted to\n these ty little delicacies. We have to make sure that whatever\n we make is real  authentic,  that\'s why we still\n want to do it by h. Our ondeh ondeh\n is still done by h, our kueh dadar is still\n dividually hrolled, our kueh lapis is still hlayered, layer by layer. That\'s why we start at 2am. It\'s to make sure that\n the best  freshest products go out to "
239,1.0,"our outlets\n all over Sgapore. Our first trip out  the\n central kitchen is at about 8am,  then throughout the day,\n we contue to make the kuehs,  as the kuehs are done,\n they get sent out islwide, from Jurong all the way to Changi,\n   course, that cludes Jewel. Our store at Jewel\n is our flagship store. We try to make it a little different by usg elements \n Peranakan floral motifs. We’ve also used batik\n because that\'s part  our heritage. About one  a half to two hours. We also have a\n demonstration counter. At this counter, you can see how\n our kueh lapis is made, layer by layer, one layer at a time. That’s somethg that\'s a bit unique. Keep compressg it down, be sure to make it even,\n so that it is flat. Yes, it takes a lot  time. When Bengawan Solo started  1979,\n 0 years ago, we already have\n our pan chiffon.

It’s really what Sgaporeans  locals\n have been eatg for generations. Food is an enormous part\n  Sgapore\'s culture, partly because we\'re immigrants. In those days, when people migrated,\n it was due to hunger, fame, or floods. And to be able to eat well\n was a sign  success. Everyone  Sgapore\n is a connoisseur. I thk you\'ll experience this\n even when you ride a taxi.  taxi driver is equally a gourmet  can tell you exactly\n how this fish is steamed. I thk that\'s amazg to many people\n from around the world. I thk that for Sgaporeans,\n food is actually the ties that bd. We have a photo wall that showcases\n our history  food culture. ong this section,\n which is very terestg, we have the chefs who are known as the “Four Heavenly\n Kgs  Sgapore food”. y came together\n to create yu sheng, which is our famous\n Sgaporean raw "

If she cannot pound,\n it means she cannot cook,  therefore,\n is unsuitable for my son. We do feel a sense  pride\n  beg at Jewel. It is so important\n because this is the airport, which is a gateway\n for people to visit us. We want to fer a taste\n  some local Malay dishes, so we have satay,  we have fish curry,\n which origates from Little India. We are actually presentg\n the whole  Asia on the table. Bon appétit.\n Thank you. As a Sgaporean,\n personally, I feel very proud that almost half  the brs here\n are Sgapore brs. As Changi Airport  Jewel\n is such an ternational location, this is a good place to\n showcase these brs. “Sgapore meets the world\n  the world"

One  the thgs that will really\n strike you, when you enter Jewel, is the lush greenery\n  the sound  the waterfall, as the water flows down\n from the Vortex. You see all this glass?  glass panels allow\n the natural light  durg the day, so we don’t have to make use\n  additional energy to power the lightg\n with the dome.

So we will switch out the orchids\n  one  the orchid trees to fit  with the colours\n  the new season. We will change this first,\n it will take about three to four hours.

In the weeks leadg up\n to the openg, there were days when we\n had to work till 2am or 3am, as we had to make sure that\n everythg was done correctly. I have a young daughter,\n under two years old.

It is,  essence, a celebration\n  what everyone has achieved. Jewel’s ficial openg, to me, is like the openg  April\n all over aga.  preview period\n was defitely challengg. We all worked around the clock. We had to stay at YOTELAIR just so\n we could catch some sleep  between. Durg the preview week, we saw an estimated 600,000 visitors\n over seven days.

It’s tense.  bs would be filled up\n every 15 mutes,  our crew had to, literally,\n run around with b lers  get the bs emptied\n as quickly as possible before they overflowed.  first few days after\n Jewel’s openg were really hectic. re were long queues at\n many  the shops  restaurants. Likewise, durg\n the lightsound show, there were big crowds\n around the Ra Vortex. Many  the travellers\n shared with me that they had flown to Sgapore\n just to see the openg  Jewel. At the very first lightsound show\n for the public, this was where\n we were watchg it from. I still can’t forget that day. I was stg on Level 5 with ex. We were watchg\n the show from there. Before the day  the preview, we were still fetung\n the lightsound show.  first show at 7:30pm... was the first perfect show\n that we ever got.

We will be havg rehearsals,\n  after that, it\'s showtime. Today is the ficial openg  Jewel,\n  as you can see, we’ve already closed f the entire\n Forest Valley  preparation for it.

I\'ve been hearg comments from\n my friends from other countries. y\'d say, ""I hear there\'s gog to be\n this place  Sgapore called \'Jewel\'."" When I saw it for myself,\n I was very excited because I felt that\n this is gog to be a place that the whole world\n will want to visit, just to experience it. I thk what\'s great about Jewel is that... it\'s also our airport. To me, I feel that\n it checks plenty  boxes,  terms  what Sgapore represents\n  what Sgapore sts for. It\'s really enjoyed,\n not just by visitors, but also very much\n by Sgaporeans themselves. I want to say that\n no other country’s citizens feel the same way about their airports\n as Sgaporeans do. We\'ve always set out\n for Jewel to be a place where people can build\n fond memories.

This is a picture  my parents. se are my mum, my dad,\n  my husb, who visited me when\n the Canopy Park first opened. One  the memorable thgs\n that I want to share is this moment when my parents\n came over to me  said, “I don\'t remember\n what you look like anymore.  only time I can see you is when\n I literally come to Changi Airport  meet you for dner.” But after they came over\n  saw the openg, I thk they were filled with pride. y then understood why I was puttg\n so much time  effort to this. I was spendg\n a lot  time at work, cludg many late nights\n  the Ra Vortex, workg with the\n American consultant. My mum actually felt that I was\n spendg much less time with her.

Jewel helped me\n to get back  touch with friends whom I’ve lost contact with\n for the last 15, 20 years. re\'s a gynaecologist\n whom I see from time to time. Every time I see her, she will say, “You know, I am so proud  you. I\'m gog to tell my other patients that I know the girl who does\n the lscapg  Jewel.” I thk she is really\n very proud  me. One  the comments\n that I remember vividly was about feelg very proud\n to be Sgaporean, that Jewel has become\n an icon to the world,  that the team behd Jewel\n did a good job. Seeg comments like that\n makes me feel that... all the late nights at Jewel\n are worth it.  ficial openg ceremony\n defitely feels like one milestone, like it marks the end \n all the opengs that we\'ve had.

Tesla had lots  pressure,\nto produce a low cost car. And as soon as the design \nthe vehicle was at least viable enough to show the public  viable enough\nto know that it could be produced, it was released\nto the public. Most manufacturers don\'t release cars\nthat early, they don\'t release the whole vehicle, they don\'t give\nspecs, they don\'t give prices. When that happened, the manufacturg part,\nhow to build the car, was first really beg thought . So when, when are deliveries? Well, they\'re next year.

Well, eventually, by the end \nDecember, the production rate, at least accordg to Elon Musk,\nwill be twenty thous vehicles. Thg that\'s gonna be a major challenge for us over the next\nsix to ne months is how do we build a huge number  cars? Frankly, we\'re gonna be\n production hell.

Airles face an uphill battle\nkeepg their planes clean. Mosquitoes carryg diseases like\nmalaria  yellow fever can sneak aboard planes. To combat bugs  other\npests the  Health Organization  the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization have advised airles\nto use aircraft dissection, a term that refers\nto the process  sprayg an aircraft cab\nwith secticide while passengers are on board\nor after they\'ve disembarked.

Deep cleang when every ch\n the plane is cleaned, happens overnight when an aircraft\nis parked at an airport. Though cleang stards vary\nairle to airle, most carriers follow a\nfew basic procedures. Cab cleaners today generally\nare outfitted with protective clothg  disposable\ngloves, similar to what you see here.

U.S. airles have some employees who\nclean their planes but to save money, the vast majority\n cab cleang work is outsourced to dozens \ncompanies across the U.S. In 2018, nearly twothirds \ncab cleaners worked for thirdparty companies. Airles ten award contracts\nto the lowest bidder. I mean, essentially what the\nairles have setup through contractg is they forced the\ncontractors to compete for who can provide the service \ncab cleang, as well as some  the other airle\njobs, at the lowest bid. And that means who can pay the\nworkers the least to do the work because that\'s how the\ncontractors cut their costs. re are dozens  companies\nvolved  cab cleang at the almost 500 commercial\nairports across the country.

So the conglomerate  the day was dissolved  the company went back to beg called ""Boeg."" With the development  turbo jets, the Boeg 707 was troduced to the public  1958 on Pan American\'s trans Atlantic route  the public loved it With smoother rides  a shorter flight time Boeg paved the way for the future  commercial flight. Boeg may encapsulate Americana via the golden age  flyg but the much younger Airbus had a rough road to success. It started as a group effort  Europe to take on American manufacturers. In 1967 Germany, France,  Brita came to the agreement that a cooperation  aviati"
470,0.0,"on field would promote technology  economic growth  Europe. y drew up plans for a short haul European Airbus that would accommodate the public\'s desire to fly more for less. Plans were made to construct the A300. In October  1972 the A300 completed its first flight. But Airbus leaders had an uphill battle ahead  them convcg the world they created the most novative aircraft. By 198 Airbus received 11 orders  had 282 aircraft  active service.  persistence paid f the long run because  2018 Airbus delivered 800 planes. 11% growth from the year before. And Boeg\'s busess is thrivg as well. In 2018 the company set the record for the most airplane deliveries with 806 commercial jets, 5.6% growth from 2017. And the stocks have reflected the company\'s domance. Both Airbus  Boeg stocks have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. How can you tell these planes apart? Boeg  Airbus have subtle differences. For stance the cockpit  a Boeg 737 has a yoke control whereas an Air"
471,0.0,"bus A320 does not. That\'s just one  the many ways these companies diverge  their manufacturg. Most are only felt by the crew  travelers with a keen eye. How do airles decide which company to buy from?   it like gog to a car dealership  choosg between a Chevy  a Ford. Both are supposed to get you to your destation but which one has a better deal? And what does the existg fleet look like? For example, Spirit  Frontier operate only Airbus, while Southwest is an all Boeg fleet. It\'s hard for low cost operations like these to switch.  legacy airles usually have a mix  both. So what does it take for companies like Airbus  Boeg to control the airle dustry? Well, buildg these airplanes isn\'t cheap. To be a real competitor aviation companies must have the money to spend.  barriers to entry  this busess are huge  terms  capital requirements,  terms  technology experience, customer support, customer fance, all  these thgs. A sgle plane can run up millions  dollars  construction fees. Boeg is c"
472,0.0,"urrently workg on a new series  airplanes called the 777X. A sgle 7779 has a list price  $388.7 million dollars. That\'s because there are hundreds  thouss  components to an airplane. A Boeg 77 alone is made up  six million parts. But materials aren\'t the only thg that costs aviation companies big. Safety comes with a hefty price tag. It\'s defitely a wellregulated dustry. I don\'t thk there\'s any question about that. I actually view much, not all, but I view much  that regulation has a historical partnership that has actually served the dustry quite well. If you consider that the airles today aviation globally carries three billion passengers a year  most years kill fewer than 500  them. Some years none. That\'s a pretty extraordary record. And reachg that level  safety requires a great expense And these massive companies have plenty  money And at least for Boeg a lot  it comes from the government.

Our team is focused on tellg Boeg""s story  supportg policies that advance the aviation dustry  U.S. manufacturg  the communities where we live  work.""  company\'s entrenched position has a real"

When Delta ordered planes from the Canadian company Bombardier  2016, the company fought hard argug the smaller competitor could only sell them at such a low price to the Canadian subsidies.  Trump admistration origally sided with Boeg puttg tariffs on the planes but Boeg ended up losg the battle when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled  Bombardier\'s is favor at the begng  2018.  battle showed how hard it has become for smaller companies to break to the market. Which brgs us exactly to that where is the competition? Airbus  Boeg may comm domestic  ternational airspace but for regional flights the Canadian company Bombardier  the Brazilian company Embraer control the market or at least they used to.  overhead for the aviation manufacturg busess can be crushg  regional aircraft manufacturers like Bombardier a couldn\'t shoulder the costs. Bombardier  Canada had the  best hope  gettg  they simply ran out  cash. And this year their jetler was basically absorbed by"
475,0.0, Airbus. Now the Airbus A220 rather than the Bombardier CSeries. In 2017 Airbus announced it would acquire a majority stake  Bombardier\'s CSeries. Airbus rebred the series as a new a 220  sold 120 former CSeries jets to U.S. airle companies  2018. Airbus will beg buildg the aircraft later this month. And let\'s not forget about Brazilian aircraft company Embraer the other regional jet manufacturer. Boeg just bought 80%  Embraer commercial aviation busess for a whoppg $.2 billion dollars.  Brazilian government approved the deal  January  both companies announced that they expect to get all the remag approvals before 2020.  reality was that these smaller companies weren\'t really competg anyway. In 2016 regional aircraft deliveries were less than 7%  the airplane market by value. Other countries like Russia   have also been tryg to become proment players  the aircraft manufacturg dustry. But so far both countries have been unable to make a dent  the private sector. y could flip a switch

Boeg  Airbus aren\'t shyg away from potential competition. Boeg highlighted its partnership with COMAC on a completion  a facility  Zhoushan.  company also told us, ""\'s commercial aviation sector represents a major customer an important partner  a potent competitor.  is on track"

When we asked Airbus about Chese competition they told  this ""the Boeg Airbus to Oxley isn\'t likely to last forever. In general we see  as the next major competitor though  some 10 to 20 years from now.  Chese market is large enough for more than two competitors  every market we welcome competition.

So how has Domo's\nwon India's pizza war?  pizza market  India is\nvalued at over $1.5 billion. That's small compared to the U.S. market, which is worth\n$6.7 billion dollars. Still, the market is huge considerg\nthe huge population that India has. But when Domo's  Pizza\nHut started operations  India  1995  1996, respectively, the\npizza market was much smaller.

India is Domo's second largest\nmarket after the U.S.. It's a different story\nfor Pizza Hut. Its busess  India makes up\na small fraction  Pizza Hut. Overall busess, the country accounts for\njust one percent  system sales. , on the other h, accounts\nfor 17 percent  Pizza Hut sales. More  more local restaurants\nare startg to fer pizza, too.

In fact, Jubilant FoodWorks sales have\nseen double digit growth for 13 out  the last 1 fiscal years. Jubilant FoodWorks also runs Dunk \nIndia  operates its own Chese food cha.

Papa John's entered India nearly a decade\n a half after its rivals, Domo's  Pizza Hut had\ncome onto the scene. By the time Papa John's exped to\nIndia, some experts say it was already too late.

Domo's franchisee Jubilant FoodWorks says\nit was the first food service company to launch onle\n mobile orderg nationally  India. Analysts agree  say\nthat Domo's troduced the onle orderg culture. And as  January\n2020, nearly 30 million people downloaded Domo's mobile\norderg app. If you look at a market like\n India, Internet is mostly used thr"

While Domo's has succeeded  delivery\n with its mobile app, experts say Pizza Hut was focused more\non dg  just like it has  the U.S.. Some consumers prefer that,\nbut it means that Pizza Hut needs to rent large  usually\nmore expensive real estate to fer seatg.

While many fast food brs look\nto  for growth, Domo's has struggled there.  company attributes that\nto the fact that cheese  bread aren't part \na traditional Chese diet. In India, the pizza cha\nhasn't had that problem. Domo's tries to make sure its\nmenu is wellsuited to every country. It exps to. In addition to ferg American\nstaples like sausage  veggie, Domo's, India serves pies topped\nwith familiar gredients like chicken tikka paneer cheese\n red paprika. Chicken is the most\npopular meat  India. And Hdus don't eat beef, which\nis why chicken domates the onle menu at Domo's. It's even hyper localized its products\nby region ettg menu items more suited to tastes\n certa states. For stance,  201, South Indian\ncustomers got a spicy banana pizza. Green bananas are ten\nused  traditional South Indian dishes. Domo's localize more\nthan its menu. It tailored each restaurant\nto local c"

In another huge differentiator, Domo's fers\npies at a lower price than Pizza Hut see when\nthey launched  the 1990s. Not very many people wanted\nto have a pizza. So you had to brg them to\nthe level  acceptability that, you know, you come   have a\npizza or you order a pizza. so, if you look at the kd\n prices that are there, Domo's does awful pizzas, which would be for I thk\nif I have to put it across an American dollar terms, which would\nbe less than a dollar. Middle class consumer spendg is\non the rise  India. That means they'll be spendg more\non food  beverages two times more, accordg to \nEconomic Forum estimates.

1086,0.0,has raised this issue with national fance misters  we're gog to look at whether we evoke worksafe to achieve this whether we use the employment surance programs this is the one that we've been focusg on with the federal fance mister we're gog to fd a way to get there but we have to get there it's imperative to our wellbeg it's imperative to us not just gettg past cope  neteen but makg this part  parcel  how we operate  the workplace next our question is from Sean Eckford Thank You mr. premier I wanted to get back to some comments you made about the upcomg long weekend because as you know  coastal communities that means one question people travelg on the ferries  people are lookg for firm guidance on what is considered an essential trip on BC Ferries this comg long weekend can you go visit your grmother  another town go to your second property that sort  thg now these are very good questions  our direction would be if you don't need to be travellg you shouldn't be travelg that we've bee
1087,0.0,n pretty clear on that havg said that as we start to move to the various phases  the restart plan when we get to Phase three later to the summer that might be the better time to get to that second property if you have the good fortune  owng a second property  British Columbia there was a a cab or a cottage you're a tax payer you have property  that community you have a right to be there but aga you also have to acknowledge  recognize the permanent residents  those communities may not have access to acute care facilities may be concerned that the spread  the virus   their community is somethg that they want to avoid  I thk the best course  action would be to stay closer to your home until we get further to the summer we we need to make sure that our see ferry system contues to operate 85% reduction  ridership yearoveryear tells me that that people aren't takg nonessential trips are not an enormous amount  nonessential trips but aga I hope people will exercise their good judgments   not 
1088,0.0,travel to another community to enjoy the long weekend British Columbia every corner  British Columbia is spectacular  my experience  travelg around BC throughout my lifetime wherever you live is an outstg place stay there  enjoy it our next question is from Katie De Rosa hi premier um it was mentioned it's been mentioned  European countries that there is sort  a threshold  cases or transmission rate spikes that would reach rigor lockdowns does BC have a trigger pot for gog back to further restrictions  if so is it perhaps the second wave is comg  the fall what what could be the risk to workers  busesses if there's another shutdown before I asked dr. Henry to respond to that I'll say that British Columbia has been chartg its own course from the begng Mister Dixon  dr. Henry raised alarm bells about Koba 19 long before anyone else was dog so  we were benefited from that as a community  that's why we're where we are today we are now proceedg to the restart plan  as I said we're gog to be 
1089,0.0,dog it cautiously based on the science if we see a spike will respond but dr. henwy will be givg us advice on that so best pass it to her thkg about from the very begng  that's why you know this thoughtful  careful approaches the way we're gog we do not want to be startg  stoppg  startg  stoppg so I believe that this plan  the way we've put it together gives us the tools so that we can crease our contacts our numbers  our safe contacts  a way that keeps us on a steady state for at least the comg months as I've mentioned before we don't know what's gog to happen  the fall we don't know if there's gog to be a resurgence once fluenza  other taury viruses come back so that's why it's so important  part  our plan to make sure that we contue to have the vigilance  the public health system the testg that we need to the contact tracg  we'll be monitorg thgs very carefully but the plan  the thoughtfulness  the purpose that we have is to make sure that we can get through at least until the fall

SO THOSE THREE  CONDITIONS HAVE  BEEN ADDRESSED  AND ANYBODY IN  THE MEDIA, ANY  TIME YOU SEE  SOMETHING LIKE  THAT, WE WANT TO  DIRECT IT  IMMEDIATELY. NEW YORKERS, IF  YOU SEE ANY PLACE WHERE HOMELESS  FOLKS ARE  CONGREGATING WE  NEED TO KNOW SO  WE CAN GET OUT  AND ADDRESS IT. WE NEED TO GET  THE PEOPLE HELP  AND GET THEM OFF  THE STREET. WELL, SPEAKING OF STREETS, SOME  GOOD NEWS TODAY  AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE  OPEN STREETS  INITIATIVE. THIS IS AN  INITIATIVE. CITY COUNCIL PUT  THIS IDEA OUT  THERE. IT\'S AN IDEA THAT NOW IS READY TO  GO INTO HIGHER  GEAR. I WANT TO THANK  THE CITY COUNCIL  FOR THEIR  PARTNERSHIP AND  WANT TO THANK THE NYPD AND  DEPARTMENT OF  TRANSPORTATION  AND DEPARTMENT OF PARTS. ALL THE CITY  AGENCIES ARE  WORKING TOGETHER  TO MAKE THIS  WORK, AND THANK  GOD, ALL THOSE  CITY AGENCIES  HAVE MORE AND  MORE OF THEIR  EMPLOYEES COMING  BACK WHO HAD BEEN SICK WITH  COVID19. THE WORKFORCE"
1228,0.0," IS  STRENGTHENED SO  WE CAN DO THIS  WITH THE RIGHT  KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT AND  MAKE THEM WORK  FOR EVERYONE. SO OVER THE LAST  FEW DAYS,  INCLUDING THE  WEEKEND, WE HAVE  OPENED OVER SEVEN MILES AND NOW  WE\'RE ADDING TWO  MORE MILES THAT  WILL BE OPEN  TOMORROW,  THURSDAY. IN THIS CASE,  THESE ARE  SPECIFIC SITES  THAT ARE BEING  MANAGED BY LOCAL  BUSINESS  IMPROVEMENT  DISTRICTS, SO  LOCAL  ORGANIZATIONS  THAT DO SUCH  IMPORTANT WORK  FOR THEIR  COMMUNITIES, AND  HAVE TAKEN  RESPONSIBILITY  THAT EVERYTHING  IS SET UP AND  MONITORED AND  SAFE. AND THEY WORK  VERY CLOSELY OF  COURSE WITH THE  NYPD AND DOT. I WANT TO THANK  THE FLAT IRON AND GARMENT DISTRICT  AND THE DOWNTOWN  BROOKLYN  PARTNERSHIP AND  THE THIRD AVENUE  IN THE BRONX. ALL OF THEM  STEPPED FORWARD  AND ARE GOING TO  ENSURE THAT THESE STREETS THAT YOU  CAN SEE ON THE  SLIDES WILL BE  OPEN STREETS,  AGAIN, STARTING  TOMORROW. I ALSO WANT TO  ANNOUNCE THAT ONE OPEN STREET THAT  WAS PART OF THE  VERY ORIGINAL  PILOT PROGRAM"
1229,0.0,",  THIS ONE IS NOW  COMING BACK. IT\'S A HALF MILE  ALONG  JACKSONVILLE. THE PILOT  LOCATION IS NOW  BECOMING A  FULLTIME  LOCATION FOR THE  DURATION OF THIS  CRISIS. AND AGAIN, THIS  IS THE NEXT PHASE AND MORE TO COME  SOON AS WE BUILD. ANOTHER THING WE  ARE BUILDING OUT  ALL OVER NEW YORK CITY IS THE  INITIATIVE TO  DISTRIBUTE FREE,  SAFE COVERINGS TO ALL NEW YORKERS  WHO NEED IT. THIS IS GETTING A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE. PEOPLE ARE REALLY THANKFUL TO BE  GETTING FACE  COVERINGS AND THE MORE THEY GET,  THE MORE THEY\'RE  USING THEM, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT  WE WANT. I TOLD YOU THIS  WEEK EARLIER THAT THEY WOULD BE  DISTRIBUTING  7.5 MILLION FREE  FACE COVERINGS. AND THAT IS  REALLY GOING TO  MAKE A HUGE  IMPACT AND SO  PEOPLE WHO WANT  TO KNOW WHERE  THEY CAN GET  THEM, AGAIN WE  HAVE A MAP THAT  IDENTIFIES  LOCATIONS ALL  OVER THE CITY. WE\'VE ADDED A  NUMBER OF  LOCATIONS SINCE  THE WEEKEND. ALL YOU HAVE TO  DO IS GO TO  NYC.GOV/FACE COVERINGS AND YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER  OF PLACES "
1230,0.0,"WHERE  YOU CAN GET A  FACE COVERING TO  HELP PROTECT  EVERYONE. YOUR FAMILIES,  YOUR FELLOW NEW  YORKERS, TO HELP  DRIVE BACK THIS  DISEASE. NOW, I LIKE TO  EXPRESS MY THANKS EVERY DAY. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE DOING SO  MANY GOOD THINGS  IN THIS CITY. 8.6 MILLION  PEOPLE PULLING  TOGETHER TO FIGHT BACK THIS  DISEASE. WELL, TODAY IS  ONE OF THOSE  NATIONAL DAYS OF  THANKS FOR A  PARTICULAR GROUP  THAT HAS BEEN  JUST UNBELIEVABLY HEROIC, AND THAT  IS OUR NURSES. TODAY IS NATIONAL NURSES DAY. SO LISTEN,  UNBELIEVABLE,  ABSOLUTELY  BREATHTAKING WHAT THE NURSES OF NEW YORK CITY HAVE  DONE DURING THIS  CRISIS. THEY\'RE HEROS TO  THIS CITY AND  HEROS TO THIS  WHOLE NATION. SO I THINK IT\'S A FAIR STATEMENT IF THERE\'S ANY NEW  YORKER OUT THERE  OR ANY AMERICAN  OUT THERE WHO  DIDN\'T APPRECIATE OUR NURSES  BEFORE, WELL,  THEY DAMN SURE  WELL APPRECIATE  THEM NOW. AND THAT IS JUST  AND FAIR THAT  NURSES ARE  FINALLY GETTING  THE RECOGNITION  THEY DESERVE. BUT WE SURE WANT  TO DO MORE. I\'VE H"
1231,0.0,"AD THE JOY  OF GOING OUT TO A NUMBER OF OUR  HOSPITALS, PLACES LIKE ELMERS  HOSPITAL, KINGS  COUNTY HOSPITAL,  A NUMBER OF  OTHERS, TO  APPLAUD ALL THE  HEALTH CARE  WORKERS, TAKE A  SPECIAL  APPRECIATION  THANKING OUR  NURSES FOR WHAT  THEY\'VE DONE  HERE. AND EVERYONE  TODAY, WHEN YOU  SEE ANY HEALTH  CARE WORKER, BUT  PARTICULARLY  SINCE IT\'S THEIR  DAY, WHEN YOU SEE A NURSE, SAY THE  WORDS THANK YOU  AND SAY IT WITH  PASSION, BECAUSE  THEY DESERVE ALL  THE THANKS IN THE WORLD. NOW, I\'LL FRAME  WHAT WE DO EACH  DAY, OF COURSE,  GO OVER OUR DAILY INDICATORS. I\'LL FRAME THIS  BY SAYING NOT  EVERY DAY GOES  THE WAY WE PLAN  IT. THE BIG TREND IS  GOOD, BUT  DAYTODAY WE  STILL SEE  FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE SOBERING AND  IT\'S A REMINDER  DO NOT TAKE OUR  FOOT OFF THE GAS, DO NOT RELAX OUR  RULES UNTIL IT\'S  TIME, GET IT  RIGHT. FIGHT BACK THIS  DISEASE, AVOID  THAT BOOMERANG,  BECAUSE TODAY WE  SEE SOME NUMBERS  THAT REMIND US WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. SO ON THE FIRST  ONE, DAILY NUMBER "
1232,0.0,"OF PEOPLE  ADMIT TO THE  HOSPITAL FOR  SUSPEC  COVID19. THAT NUMBER HAS  GONE UP. IT\'S GONE UP  MARKEDLY, ALSO A  MUCH SMALLER  BUSINESS, SO FROM 75 TO 109. WE\'VE GOT TO SEE  THAT GO DOWN. THE NUMBER OF  PEOPLE IN ICUs  ACROSS OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS FOR  SUSPEC  COVID19, STILL  TOO LARGE A  NUMBER. THE INCREASE IS  SMALL FROM 596 TO 599. WE\'VE GOT TO GET  THAT NUMBER DOWN. THAT\'S ANOTHER  KEY PIECE OF THE  PUZZLE. VERY GOOD NUMBER  TO GO DOWN IS THE THIRD ONE, THE  PERCENTAGE OF  PEOPLE TESTING  POSITIVE FOR  COVID19, THAT IS DOWN FROM 22% TO  15%. OBVIOUSLY IT\'S A  UNIVERSAL MEASURE AND THAT IS A  GOOD EXAMPLE,  THAT\'S GOOD NEWS  TODAY. SO MORE FIGHT  AHEAD. WE WANT TO GET  ALL THESE NUMBERS GOING DOWN  TOGETHER. I AM CONVINCED WE WILL, BUT WE\'VE  GOT SOME MORE  WORK TO DO. SO THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO THAT WORD I STAR WITH,  MODERATION. THINK OF THE  VIRUS AGAIN, GIVE IT HUMAN  CHARACTERISTICS  FOR A MOMENT. THIS IS A VIRUS  THAT SEEKS OUT  OUR WEAKNESSES. I TALKED A FEW  DAYS AGO "
1233,0.0,"ABOUT  SOME BIG CITIES  IN ASIA THAT  STAR TO OPEN  UP A LITTLE TOO  FAST AND  UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO CLAMP BACK  DOWN AND IN FACT  ADD NEW  RESTRICTIONS. IN SOME CASES IT  WAS ONLY ONE PART OF THE CITY THAT  WAS A PROBLEM,  BUT IT BECAME A  PROBLEM FOR  EVERYONE. THIS DISEASE  LOOKS FOR OUR  WEAKNESSES AND  TRIES TO EXPLOIT  THEM. WE CAN\'T LET THAT HAPPEN. SO AGAIN, I SEE  ALL OVER THE CITY INCREDIBLE  DISCIPLINE AND  INCREDIBLE  ADHERENCE TO THE  RULES. I WANT EVEN MORE. I DON\'T WANT TO  LET THIS DISEASE  BACK IN THE DOOR. SO LET\'S KEEP  FIGHTING, BECAUSE I KNOW WE ALL  WANT THAT  RESTART, WE WANT  THAT RESTART AND  LET\'S GET IT  RIGHT RIGHT NOW,  AND WE\'LL DO IT  WITH MODERATION. THAT\'S HOW WE  MAKE SURE THAT  EVERY STEP WE  TAKE HOLDS AND  THEN WE TAKE THE  NEXT STEP. THAT\'S THE GAME  PLAN AND WE\'LL  HAVE A LOT MORE  TO SAY ON THIS IN THE COMING DAYS.

IT\'S A PRETTY  WELLOILED  MACHINE NOW WITH  GREAT RESULTS. SEVERAL THOUSAND  PEOPLE HAVE COME  IN OFF THE  STREETS AND NOT  COME BACK TO THE  STREETS. SO STEVE WILL  TALK TO ME ABOUT  WHAT WE DO WITH  PEOPLE TO MAKE  SURE THAT THEY  RECEIVE THOSE  SERS AND STAY TO THE MAXIMUM  EXTENT POSSIBLE. BUT TO THE  NUMBER, I WANT TO CAUTION THAT  AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\'S  ANNUAL STUDY  THAT\'S RUN FOR A  LONG TIME, SAYS  THE TOTAL NUMBER  OF HOMELESS  PEOPLE IN NEW  YORK CITY ON THE  STREETS, ON THE  SUBWAYS, ALL FIVE BOROUGHS IS  BETWEEN 3,500 AND ,000. IN THE COLD  MONTHS, THE  WINTER MONTHS,  YOU SEE A LOT  MORE PEOPLE GO  INTO THE SUBWAYS. STEVE WILL GIVE  YOU HIS VIEW. HE\'S LITERALLY  ONE OF THE  LEADING EXPERTS  ON HOMELESSNESS  NOT ONLY IN NEW  YORK CITY, BUT IN THE UNI STATES OF AMERICA AND  HE\'S BEEN AT IT  FOR "
1237,0.0,"ABOUT 30  YEARS. WHEN I HEAR THAT  NUMBER, I RESPECT PAT A LOT. I LIKE HIM AND  RESPECT HIM. I DON\'T  UNDERSTAND HOW  THAT NUMBER COULD BE ACCURATE,  GIVEN WHAT WE  KNOW OF  HOMELESSNESS IN  THE CITY AND THIS TIME OF YEAR,  IT\'S HARD FOR ME  TO IMAGINE THAT  MANY PEOPLE THAT  ARE ACTUALLY  STREET HOMELESS. THAT\'S DIFFERENT  FROM PEOPLE WHO  MIGHT LIVE IN A  SHELTER OR APPEAR TO BE HOMELESS  BUT MAY NOT BE  HOMELESS. BUT THAT NUMBER  SURPRISES ME IS  ALL I\'LL SAY. BUT STEVE, YOU\'RE THE EXPERT. TELL US WHAT YOU  THINK OF THAT.  >> STEVE, CAN YOU HEAR ME? >> THERE YOU GO. >> I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE SAW LAST  NIGHT OUT IN THE  FIELD. WE WERE DOWN AT  THE WORLD TRADE  CENTER AND OTHER  LOCATIONS WORKING WITH THE STAFF. WE ENCOUNTERED  NORTH OF 250  PEOPLE AND ABOUT  60% OF THEM CAME  INSIDE AND WE  HAVE SHELTERS AND SAFE HAVENS. SO WE\'RE  PROVIDING THE  SAME SERS TO  THE PEOPLE LAST  NIGHT THAT  ENABLED US TO  BRING 2,500  PEOPLE OFF THE  STREET WHO  REMAINED OFF THE  STREET, AND  THAT"

HALF THE PEOPLE  THAT YOU SEE IN  THE SUBWAYS ARE  TRANSIENT,  MEANING ONE OR  TWO NIGHTS, AND  YOU MAY NOT SEE  THEM AGAIN. LAST NIGHT THERE  WAS A FOCUS ON  THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE LONGTERM ON  THE SUBWAYS. SO THAT\'S WHY I  THINK THE SUCCESS OF LAST NIGHT   GRAN IT\'S ONLY ONE NIGHT,  BRINGING IN 139  PEOPLE IS REALLY  WHAT WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON, THE  HUMAN BEINGS THAT ARE IN THE SUBWAY AND HAVE BEEN  THERE FOR A LONG  PERIOD OF TIME,  AS OPPOSED TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  THERE ONE OR TWO  NIGHTS AND YOU  NEVER SEE THEM  AGAIN. THAT\'S THE  PERCEPTION THAT  THERE\'S LOTS OF  PEOPLE THERE FOR  LONG PERIODS OF  TIME. OUR FOCUS IS ON  THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE RE"

AGAIN, HEARING AN ESTIMATE OF  SEVERAL THOUSAND, MY QUESTION, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE  IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT COULD ALL BE STREET HOMELESS  FOLKS OR DO YOU  ASSUME THAT\'S  SOME COMBINATION  OF PEOPLE THAT IS STREET HOMELESS  AND OTHER KIND OF FOLKS? >> I THINK  EXPERIENCE TELLS  YOU THAT PEOPLE  END UP ON THE  STREETS FOR  PERIODS OF TIME  OR ARE PERCEIVED  FOR ALL RANGE OF  ECONOMIC REASONS, BUT THEY\'RE NOT  THE PEOPLE THAT  YOU SEE EVERY  DAY. THOSE ARE THE  PEOPLE THAT YOU  SEE EVERY DAY  THAT WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON IN THE PLAN. SO SOMEONE WHO  NIGHT BE  PANHANDLING, FOR  EXAMPLE, MAY WELL HAVE A HOME.

AS YOU\'RE WELL  AWARE WILLIAMS  AND ADAMS, THE  NYPD ENFORCEMENT  OF SOCIAL  DISTANCING HAS  SHOWN DISPARITIES THAT THE  ENFORCEMENT HAS  BEEN SUBJECTIVE  AND SELECTIVE AND THEY WANT YOU TO  RELEASE DATA. I WONDER YOUR  TAKE ON IT AND IF YOU\'VE GIVEN ANY  INSTRUCTIONS TO  THE NYPD IN TERMS OF THE GUIDELINES FOR WHO GETS  APPROACHED AND  WHO GETS SUMMONS. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION HAS TO  DO WITH THE  HOMELESS AGAIN. HOMELESS  ADVOCATES ARE  SAYING THAT  YOU\'RE TAKING  HOMELESS PEOPLE  OFF THE SUBWAY  BUT NOT PROVIDING THEM WITH SAFE  ALTERNATIVES. YOU"
1241,0.0,"R RESPONSE TO  THAT? >> THANK YOU,  MARCIA. NO, I  RESPECTFULLY  DISAGREE  PROFOUNDLY WITH  THOSE ADVOCATES. I APPRECIATE  THEIR WORK, BUT  AGAIN, STEVE  BANKS LEADING OUR EFFORTS TO HELP  THE HOMELESS, ONE OF THE PREMIER  ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS FOR  DECADES IN THE  CITY AND THIS  COUNTRY. AND WHAT STEVE  HAS CREA WAS A TEAM. AND WITH ALL THE  AMAZING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND THROUGH THE  OUTREACH IS  SOMETHING  UNPRECEDEN IN  THE HISTORY OF  THE CITY AND IT  IS COMPASSIONATE  AND DECENT AND  IT\'S ABOUT  HELPING HOMELESS  FOLKS GET TO A  SAFE HAVEN OR A  SHELTER THAT  WORKS FOR THEM. WE\'VE BEEN ADDING SO MANY MORE  SPACES IN PLACES  THAT HOMELESS  PEOPLE  YOU  KNOW, WHERE WE  FIND THEM, SO WE  HAVE PLACES THAT  WORK FOR THEM. WE PROVIDE  MEDICAL CARE,  FOOD, SUBSTANCE  ABUSE SUPPORT IN  TERMS OF PROGRAMS TO GET THEM OFF  SUBSTANCES. MENTAL HEALTH  SERS. IT\'S  EXTRAORDINARILY  COMPASSIONATE AND WE KNOW IT\'S  EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OVER 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE COME IN AND  NOT GONE BACK "

THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW YORKERS  GET IT AND  THEY\'RE LIVING  THIS WAY. SOMETIMES THEY  HAVE TO BE  REMINDED, BUT  THEY ACCEPT AND  REACT  ACCORDINGLY. WE DEFINITELY  WANT TO GET THE  DATA OUT. SO WE WILL MAKE  SURE THE NYPD  GETS THE DATA  OUT. IT\'S GOING TO  SHOW YOU WHERE  THERE HAVE BEEN  SUMMONS, BUT  THERE HASN\'T BEEN A NEED TO DO A  LOT OF SUMMONS IN THE LAST TWO  MONTHS FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. THAT\'S A GOOD  THING.

BARBOT CAN  COMMENT ON THIS,  TOO, THAT IF  PEOPLE ARE  ALREADY ENTIRELY  EXPOSED TO EACH  OTHER ALL DAY  LONG IN THEIR  HOUSEHOLD, SOCIAL DISTANCING IS A  DIFFERENT CONCEPT THAN IT IS FOR  FOLKS WHO ARE NOT EXPOSED TO EACH  OTHER. IF YOU\'RE ALREADY IN CONSTANT  CONTACT WITH  SOMEONE, IT DOES  NOT REQUIRE THE  SAME APPROACH AS  IF TWO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIVE UNDER THE SAME  HOUSEHOLD  SAME ROOF, LIKE YOU  SAY, COME IN  CONTACT.

THE STIMULUS  MONEY MAKES US  WHOLE AND  REPLACES ALL THE  LOST REVENUE AND  ALLOWS US TO  RETAIN OUR  WORKFORCE AND  MAKE SURE THAT  PUBLIC SERS  ARE BEING  PROVIDED, BASIC  SERS SO WE  CAN GET ON WITH  THE RESTART AND  RECOVERY.

WE ARE VERY MUCH  ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO MAKE SURE  PARENTS KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE  BRINGING THEIR  CHILDREN IN TO  GET THEIR VAX    NATIONS AS  SCHEDULED. WE DON\'T WANT  CHILDREN GETTING  INFECTIONS OR  CONDITIONS THAT  ARE  VACCINE PREVENTABLE. SO THAT\'S A  REALLY IMPORTANT  QUESTION AND IT\'S AN OPPORTUNITY  FOR US TO GET OUT THE MESSAGE THAT  MEDICINE IS OPEN  FOR BUSINESS AND  THAT PRACTICES  ARE SEEING  PATIENTS FOR  THINGS OTHER THAN COVID AND THAT  THERE ARE WAYS TO CONDUCT THESE  VISITS THAT DON\'T ALWAYS NEED AN  INPERSON VISIT. >> GOOD MORNIN

WE HAVE A WHOLE  NEW GENERATION OF POLICE OFFICERS  WHO HAVE BEEN  TRAINED IN THIS,  ALL THE ENTIRE  FORCE HAS BEEN  TRAINED IN THIS  PHILOSOPHY IN  DEESCALATION. I THINK WE\'VE  SEEN TWO MONTHS  NOW OF THE NYPD  ENGAGING THE  PEOPLE OF THE  CITY IN THE  CONTEXT OF THE  CORONAVIRUS.

WE ALSO HAVE TO  REMEMBER THAT FOR WEEKS WE HAD THE  NYPD MISSING A  HUGE PERCENTAGE  OF ITS OFFICERS  BECAUSE OF THE  DISEASE. WE\'RE NOW COMING  TO A SITUATION  WHERE THE FORCE  IS COMING BACK TO ITS NORMAL  LEVELS. WE\'RE GETTING  MORE AND MORE  EXPERIENCE WITH  WHAT WORKS, WHAT  DOESN\'T WORK IN  TERMS OF TRYING  TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT. THE HIERARCHY I  PRESENT IS WE\'RE  MOST CONCERNED  ABOUT LARGER  GATHERINGS. THAT\'S WHERE THE  MOST DANGER IS.

WE DO NEED TO  GIVE CLEAR  GUIDANCE, AND TO  THE OTHER POINT,  WE DEFINITELY  WANT TO BRING  COMMUNITY LEADERS AND COMMUNITY  ORGANIZATIONS  MUCH MORE DEEPLY  INTO THIS. PREVIOUSLY WHEN  THE VIRUS WAS ON  THE CONSTANT  UPSWING, THAT  WASN\'T OUR FOCUS, OBVIOUSLY. NOW THAT WE\'RE  GETTING SOME  RELIEF, IT\'S  SOMETHING WE CAN  DO MORE AND MORE, AND OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE WARMER  WEATHER IT MAKES  SENSE TO DO IT  MORE AND MORE. WE\'LL HAVE MORE  TO SAY ON THAT IN THE COMING DAYS  AS WELL. NOW JEFF. >> THANKS.

THAT\'S A  CONVERSATION THE  GOVERNOR AND I  HAD AS PART OF  THE DECISION TO  MOVE TO THE  OVERNIGHT  CLEANING. HE WAS CLEAR, I  WAS CLEAR, WE  WERE TOTALLY  UNIFIED, THAT WE  WILL RETURN TO  2HOUR SER. OBVIOUSLY THE  STATE RUNS THE  MTA, BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT  WAS PREREQUISITE  TO THE CITY  AGREEING TO THIS  PLAN AND AGREEING TO PUTTING THE  RESOURCES INTO  IT. WHEN THE CRISIS  IS OVER, WE WOULD RESUME 2HOUR  SER. THE ANSWER TO  YOUR QUESTION IS  WHEN THE CRISIS  IS OVER AND THAT  WILL DETERMINED  BY OUR  INDICATORS, THAT  WILL BE  DETERMINED BY  WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DISEASE.

I WANT TO GET US  THERE AGAIN, THE  MODERATION  APPROACH TO GET  US THERE. SO I\'M NOT GOING  TO BE SURPRISED  IF THE OVERNIGHT  CLEANING GOES ON  FOR MONTHS  BECAUSE THE  HEALTH DYNAMICS  REQUIRE IT. BUT MY HOPE IS  IT\'S A MATTER OF  MONTHS AND THEN  WE CAN GET BACK  TO THE 2HOUR  SER. ON THE QUESTION  OF POLICE  OFFICERS, I\'VE  HAD THIS  CONVERSATION WITH COMMISSIONER  SHEA. IT\'S ABSOLUTELY  ESSENTIAL THAT  OFFICERS WEAR  MASKS. THE IDEA IS, OF  COURSE, FOR THEIR ROLE THAT THEY  PLAY IN OUR  SOCIETY, EVERYONE LOOKS TO THEM FOR GUIDANCE. EVERYONE LOOKS TO THEM AS AN  EXAMPLE. WE WANT PEOPLE  WEARING MASKS  WHEN THEY\'RE  OUTSIDE AND  COMING IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE. LOOK, THE RULE"
1259,0.0," IS CLEAR. IF YOU\'RE OUTSIDE AND YOU\'RE NOT  COMING IN CONTACT WITH ANYONE,  THAT\'S A  SITUATION WHERE  YOU ARE NOT  REQUIRED TO WEAR  A MASK. BUT I THINK IT\'S  SAFE TO SAY  POLICE OFFICERS  ARE IN CONTACT  WITH PEOPLE VERY  REGULARLY, AND SO THE NOTION OF  WEARING THE MASK  REGULARLY IS THE  RIGHT THING TO  DO. AND AGAIN, I AM  WATCHING REALLY  CLOSELY WHAT ARE  WE SEEING WITH  INTERACTIONS  OVERALL ACROSS  NOW TWO MONTHS. THE RULES HAVE  EVOLVED OVER TWO  MONTHS, BUT THE  REALITY OF  DEALING WITH A  CORONAVIRUS AND  THE POLICE ROLE  IN THE  CORONAVIRUS  CRISIS, OVER TWO  MONTHS WE\'VE SEEN VERY FEW  INCIDENTS. PEOPLE SAY, OH,  IT\'S GETTING  WARMER, BE  CAREFUL, BE  WORRIED ABOUT  THAT. I\'LL TELL YOU,  JEFF, FROM THE  VERY BEGINNING OF MY  ADMINISTRATION,  PEOPLE HAVE  WARNED ME ABOUT  THE WARMER MONTHS AND I THINK IT\'S  SOMETHING TO TAKE SERIOUSLY. I KNOW I TAKE IT  SERIOUSLY, BUT I  DON\'T WANT TO  OVERRATE IT  EITHER, BECAUSE  THE WORLD HAS  CHANGED IN A LOT  OF WAYS BEFORE "
1260,0.0," THIS PANDEMIC. THE REALITY OF  POLICING IN THE  CITY HAS CHANGED  PROFOUNDLY, THE  REALITY OF THE  CITY HAS CHANGED  PROFOUNDLY. THE SUMMERS ARE  NOT WHAT THEY  USED TO BE IN THE CITY. I REMEMBER WHEN  SUMMER WAS  EQUA WITH JUST VAST AMOUNTS OF  CRIME AND  VIOLENCE AND  TENSION BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES AND  TENSION BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES AND  POLICE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN  RECENT YEARS IN  THE CITY. AND THE PANDEMIC  CUTS BOTH WAYS. THERE\'S CHANGE  AND IT\'S CLEARLY  CREA A LOT OF  FRUSTRATION AND  CHALLENGES. IT\'S ALSO CHANGED PEOPLE\'S  LIFESTYLES  PROFOUNDLY AND  IT\'S CREA  UNITY AND  PURPOSEFULNESS  ABOUT LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER. A LOT FEWER  PEOPLE ON THE  STREET TO BE  POLICED. SO I DON\'T THINK  IT\'S A SIMPLE  EQUATION THAT  SAYS WE\'RE ONLY  GOING IN ONE  DIRECTION. I THINK WE HAVE  TO GIVE CLEAR  GUIDANCE IN OUR  OFFICERS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND  WE WILL DO THAT.

IN FACT, YOU\'LL  REMEMBER THAT  WHEN THE IDEA  FIRST CAME UP,  THE CENTRAL  CONCERN WAS HOW  DO WE DO IT  SAFELY, WILL WE  HAVE THE RIGHT  KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT AND  STRUCTURES. AS WE HAVE BEEN  WORKING WITH THIS MODEL, WE\'RE  FINDING DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET IT  DONE THAT WE  BELIEVE ARE SAFE  AND COME WITH  STRUCTURE.

AND WHEN WE  WORKED WITH THE  CITY COUNCIL ON  THE RECENT  PACKAGE, ONE OF  THE STRANDS WAS  FOCUS ON  COMMUNITIES THAT  HAVE BEEN HIT BY  THE DISEASE  HARDEST, ANOTHER  OF COURSE FOCUS  ON THE AREAS  AROUND PARKS, AND THEN PARKS THE  DEMAND WAS  GROWING WITH THE  WARMER WEATHER.

YOU\'RE GOING TO  SEE THESE KIND OF OPEN STREETS IN  ALL FIVE BOROUGHS MORE AND MORE AND YOU\'RE GOING TO  SEE DIFFERENT  KINDS OF  ORGANIZATIONS TO  HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HELP MAKE THEM WORK AND GIVE  STRUCTURE JOINING INTO IT. WE\'LL ANNOUNCE  THEM AS THEY COME TOGETHER. IN TERMS OF THE  ADVISORY PANEL,  YOU RAISED A  COUPLE OF GOOD  POINTS AND SOME  OF YOUR  "
1268,0.0,"COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDIA DID, TOO,  ABOUT WHAT IT\'S  GOING TO MEAN FOR THE FUTURE TO  COME BACK  DIFFERENTLY IN  THIS CITY IN  TERMS OF ISSUES  OF  TRANSPORTATION. WHEN WE PUT  TOGETHER THE  PANELS, WE WERE  THINKING ABOUT  THE IMMEDIATE  RESTART ISSUES,  AND OBVIOUSLY  SOME OF THE  ISSUES AROUND  TRANSPORTATION  ARE GOING TO BE  DICTA BY  LARGER REALITIES  THAT ARE  DIFFERENT THAN  WHAT\'S HAPPENING, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH SMALL BUSINESS. A CERTAIN AMOUNT  OF OUR  TRANSPORTATION  SYSTEM  A LOT  OF OUR  TRANSPORTATION  SYSTEM HAS  CONTINUED  UNABA BECAUSE  IT HAD TO. SO IT\'S A  DIFFERENT  REALITY. IT\'S NOT THE  RESTART WE\'LL GO  THROUGH WITH  SMALL BUSINESS. BUT WE PUT THE  GROUP TOGETHER  BECAUSE EVEN  THOUGH IT\'S LESS  ABOUT THE  RESTART, IT\'S  VERY IMPORTANT TO WHAT HAPPENS IN  THE MONTHS  THEREAFTER. AND WE WANT TO  START PLANNING  NOW, AND AGAIN  SOME OF THE  QUESTIONS I WANT  TO THANK YOU, AND I WANT TO THANK  YOUR COLLEAGUES  WHO RAISED THIS  POINT ABOUT, IS  THIS AN  INFLECTION"

WE\'RE GOING TO  BRING IT BACK IN  SOME WAYS THAT  ARE DIFFERENT AND BETTER. AND BECAUSE WE\'RE IN A  TRANSFORMATIONAL  MOMENT, WE CAN  RETHINK SOME  THINGS AND DO  THEM VERY  DIFFERENTLY.

ARE YOU WILLING  TO SACRIFICE  FIRST RESPONDERS, TEACHERS AND  HEALTH CARE  WORKERS WITHOUT  FIRST MAKING  SPENDING CUTS  IDENTIFIED BY  CONTROLLER  STRAYER, PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT HAVE  PROVEN RESULTS  SUCH AS DRIVE NYC AND UNNECESSARY  CONTRACTS. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION IS A  FOLLOWUP TO WHAT YOU SAID ON TV  THIS MORNING  ABOUT NURSING  HOMES. YOU SAID THAT  SOME COVID  PATIENTS SHOULD  GO BACK TO THE  FACILITIES  BECAUSE THAT\'S  WHERE THEY\'RE  KNOWN. BUT HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IF  THEY\'RE ALSO  EXPOSING OTHER  VULNERABLE  ELDERLY RESIDENTS TO THE DISEASE? SHOULDN\'T THERE  BE ALTERNATIVE  FACILITIES THEY  CAN GO TO HELP  PREVENT THE  SPREAD OF THE  VIRUS? >> JULIA, AS I\'VE TALKED TO OUR  HEALTH CARE  LEADERS, THERE  HAS BEEN A  RECOGNITION THAT  THIS IS"
1271,0.0," A COMPLEX QUESTION. IT\'S NOT A SIMPLE QUESTION OF  SAYING THAT THE  BEST THINGS FOR  SENIORS ARE  ALWAYS TO SEND  THEM INTO A  HOSPITAL SETTING. WHAT I THINK I  WOULD SAY IS WE  NEED SOME REAL  SERIOUS CHANGES  IN THE APPROACH  TO NURSING HOMES. ALTHOUGH THE CITY DOESN\'T HAVE A  DIRECT ROLE IN  NURSING HOMES AND BECAUSE I DON\'T  EXPERIENCE THESE  ISSUES BECAUSE WE DON\'T REGULATE  THE NURSING  HOMES, WHAT I\'M  SEEING ON A HUMAN LEVEL IS  UNACCEPTABLE. AND OBVIOUSLY THE CITY HAS TRIED IN EVERY WAY WE CAN  TO HELP THE  NURSING HOMES IN  THE LAST TWO  MONTHS, TO GET  THEM PPE AND  PROVIDE WHATEVER  SUPPORT WE CAN. BUT I THINK THIS  CRISIS IS  POINTING OUT THAT WE NODE A  DIFFERENT  APPROACH GOING  FORWARD. A LOT OF THEM ARE FORPROFIT  ENTERPRISES. IF THAT MODEL IS  GOING TO BE  CONTINUED, IT\'S  OBVIOUSLY GOING  TO NEED MORE  RIGOROUS  STANDARDS GOING  FORWARD. BUT ON THE  SPECIFIC QUESTION OF WHERE SHOULD  THE SENIOR BE IF, GOD FOR BID, THEY CONTRACT COVID,  FIRST OF ALL, A  DOCTOR "
1272,0.0,"HAS TO  DECIDE THAT. SECOND OF ALL, I  DO UNDERSTAND  THAT YOU HAVE TO  THINK ABOUT THE  TOTALITY OF THAT  SENIOR\'S LIFE. AND FOR MANY  SENIORS IN  NURSING HOMES TO  BE AWAY FROM THAT PLACE COULD BE  PROBLEMATIC IN A  WHOLE HOST OF  OTHER WAYS. I THINK THE  QUESTION IS CAN  THE NURSING HOME  SUPPORT THAT  INDIVIDUAL WHILE  KEEPING EVERYONE  ELSE SAFE. IF THEY CAN,  THAT\'S A VIABLE  OPTION. IF THEY CAN\'T, OF COURSE THE SENIOR SHOULD NOT BE  THERE. BUT I THINK IT\'S  UP TO DOCTORS AND IT\'S ABOUT EACH  INDIVIDUAL CASE. ON THE SECOND  POINT, WE\'RE  GOING TO JUST  DISAGREE FROM THE BEGINNING,  RESPECTFULLY, AND I RESPECT THE  CONTROLLER, DON\'T AGREE WITH HIM ON SOME THINGS AS  WELL, AS TO WHICH INITIATIVES ARE  HAVING WHICH  IMPACT ON PEOPLE. ANYTHING THAT\'S  ABOUT HEALTH AND  SAFETY IS A  PRIORITY, WHETHER IT\'S PHYSICAL  HEALTH, MENTAL  HEALTH, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  HEALTH, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  SAFETY, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  SHELTER AND FOOD  RIGHT NOW.

IF OUR REVENUE  PICTURE CONTINUES TO GET WORSE AND  WORSE, NOT JUST  FOR THE NEXT  FISCAL YEAR, BUT  FOR THE ONE AFTER THAT, TOO. AND IF THEY\'RE  THREATENED FROM  POTENTIAL CUTS  FROM THE STATE  LEVEL BECAUSE THE STATE HAS RUN OUT OF MONEY, WE\'RE  GOING TO HAVE TO  DO PAINFUL THINGS AND EVERY OPTION  WILL BE ON THE  TABLE.

1556,1.0,am Hilliard assistant managg editor  the Portl Oregonian Barbara Walters correspondent   the ground rules for this is agreed by you gentlemen for these each panelists down here will ask a question the same question to each  the two cidates after the two cidates have answered a panelist will ask followup questions to try to sharpen the answers the cidates will then have an opportunity each to to make a rebuttal that will constitute the first half  the debate  I will state the rules for the second half later on some other rules the cidates are not permitted to brg prepared notes to the podium but are permitted to make notes durg the debate if the cidates exceed the allotted time agreed on I will reluctantly but certaly terrupts we asked the Convention Center audience here to abide by one ground rule please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval durg the debate now based on a toss  the co governor Reagan will respond to the first question from Marv stone governor as you're well
1557,1.0, aware the question  war  peace has emerged as a central issue  this campaign  the givetake  recent weeks President Carter's been criticized for respondg late to agressive Soviet impulses for sufficient buildup  our armed forces  a paralysis  dealg with Afghanistan  Iran you have been criticized for beg all too quick to advocate the use  lots  muscle military action to deal with foreign crises specifically what are the differences between the two  you on the uses  American military power I don't know what the differences might be because I don't know what mr. Carter's policies are I do know what he has said about me  I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace  that use  force is always  only a last resort when everythg else has failed  then only with regard to our national security now I believe also that this meetg this mission is responsibility for preservg the peace which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our countr
1558,1.0,y that we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader  the free world because we're the only one that can do it  therefore the burden  matag the peace falls on us  to mata that peace requires strength America has never gotten  a war because we were too strong we can get to a war by lettg events get out  h as they have  the last three  a half years under the foreign policies  this admistration  mr. Carter's until we're faced each time with a crisis  good management  preservg the peace requires that we control the events  try to tercept before they become a crisis but I have seen four wars  my lifetime I'm a father  sons I have a grson I don't ever want to see another generation  young Americans bleed their lives to Sy Beach heads  the Pacific or rice paddies  jungles  the  Asia or the muddy blood  bloody fields  battlefields  Europe mr. stone do you have a followup question for the governor yes governor we've been hearg that the defense buildup that you would associate yourself with w
1559,1.0,ould cost tens  billions  dollars more than is now contemplated  assumg that the American people are ready to bear this cost they nevertheless keep askg the followg question how do you reconcile huge creases  military outlays with your promise  substantial tax cuts   balancg the budget which  this fiscal year when the just ended ran more than sixty billion dollars  the red mr. stone I have submitted an economic plan that I've worked out  concert with a number  fe economists  this country all  whom approve it  believe that over a fiveyear projection this plan can permit the extra spendg for needed refurbishg  our defensive posture that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier  that we can't afford along with the cuts that I have proposed  government spendg we can't afford the tax cuts I have proposed  probably maly because mr. Carter's economic policy has built to the next five years  on beyond that a tax crease that would be takg 86 billion dollars more next year out
1560,1.0,  the people's pockets than was taken this year  my tax cut does not come close to elimatg that 86 billion dollar crease I'm only reducg the amount  the crease  other words what I'm talkg about is not puttg government back to gettg less money than governments been gettg but simply cuttg the crease the   spendg the same question now goes to President Carter President Carter would you like to have the question repeated yes President Carter the question  war  peace a central issue  this campaign you've been criticized for  the givetake for respondg late to agressive Soviet impulses for an sufficient buildup  armed forces  a paralysis  dealg with Afghanistan  Iran Governor Reagan on the other h has been criticized for beg all too quick to advocate the use  lots  muscle military action to deal with foreign crises such as I mentioned specifically what are the differences between the two  you on the uses  American military power mr. stone have had to make thouss  decisions sce I've been presi
1561,1.0,dent servg  the Oval Office  with each one  those decisions that affect the future  my country I have learned  the process I thk I'm a much wiser  more experienced man than I was when I debated for years ago agast President Ford I've also learned that they are no simple answers to complicated questions HL Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer it would be neat  plausible  wrong the fact is that this nation  the eight years before I became president had its own military strength decrease seven out  eight years the budget commitments for defense went down 37 percent  all sce I've been  fice we've had a steady carefully planned methodical but very effective crease  our commitment for defense but what we've done is to use that enormous power   prestige  military strength  the United States to preserve the peace we've not only kept peace for our own country but we've been able to extend the benefits  peace to others  the Middle East we've worked for a peace treaty betwe
1562,1.0,en Israel  Egypt successfully  have tied ourselves together with Israel  Egypt  a common defense capability this is a very good step forward for our nation security  we will contue to do as we've done  the past I might also add that there are decisions that are made  the Oval Office by every president which are pround  nature there are always trouble spots  the world  how those troubled areas are addressed by president alone  that Oval Office affects our nation directly the volvement  the United States  also our American terests that is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every president who serves that's what I try to do successfully by keepg our country at peace mr. stone do you have a followup yes I would like to be a little more specific on the use military power  let's talk about one area for a moment under what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with for example a shut f  Persian oil Gulf if that should occur or to counter a Russian expansion be
1563,1.0,yond Afghanistan to either Iran or Pakistan I asked this question  view  charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustaed  I emphasize the word sustaed power  that part  the world missed out  my State  the Union address earlier this year I poted out that any threat to the stability  security  the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security  our own country  the past we've not had an adequate military presence  that region now we have two major carrier task forces we have access to facilities  five different areas  that region  we've made it clear that workg with our allies  others that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventualities which by terrupts commerce with that crucial area  the world but  dog this we have made sure that we address this question peacefully not jectg American military forces  the combat but lettg the strength  our nation be felt  a beneficial way this I believe has assured that our terest will be protected  the Persian Gulf region as we've 
1564,1.0,done  the Middle East  throughout the world Governor Reagan you have a mute to comment or rebut well yes I questioned the figure about the decle  defense spendg out  the two previous admistrations  the precedg eight years to this admistration I would call to your attention that we were  a war that wound down durg those eight years which  course made a change  military spendg because  turng from war to peace I also would like to pot out the an presidents  those years faced with a Democratic majority  both houses  the Congress found that their requests for defense budgets were very ten cut now Gerald Ford left a fiveyear projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses  President Carter's admistration reduced that by 38 percent cut 60 ships out  the Navy buildg program that had been proposed  stopped the b1 delayed the cruise missiles stopped the production le for the Muteman missiles stopped the Trident sir delayed the Trident submare  now is planng a mobile military force 
1565,1.0,that can be delivered to various spots  the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one that is quick to look for use  force President Carter you have the last word on this question well there are various elements  Defense um one is to control nuclear weapons which I hope we'll get to later on because that's the most important sgle issue  this campaign another one is how to address troubled areas  the world I thk habitually governor Reagan has advocated the jection  military forces to troubled areas when I  my predecessors both Democrats  ans have advocated resolvg those troubles  those difficult areas  the world peacefully diplomatically  through negotiation the addition  that the buildup  military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength  order to preserve the peace but I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired  combat  the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the fiel
1566,1.0,d  battle strength is imperative for peace but the two must go h  h thank you gentlemen the next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter mr. president when you were elected  1976 the consumer price dex stood at .8% it now sts at more than 12% perhaps more significantly the nation's broader underlyg flation rate has gone up from seven to ne percent now a part  that was due to external factors beyond US control notably the more than doublg  oil prices by OPEC last year because the United States remas vulnerable to such external shocks can flation  fact be controlled if so what measures would you pursue  a second term aga it's important to put the situation to perspective  197 we had a socalled oil shock where the price  OPEC oil was raised to an extraordary degree we had an even worse old shock  1979  197 we had the worst recession the deepest  most penetratg recession sce the Second  War the recession that resulted this time was a briefest we've had sce the Second  War  additio
1567,1.0,n we've brought down flation early this year the first quarter we did have a very severe flation pressure brought about by the OPEC price crease Everage to about 18% the first quarter this year the second quarter we had dropped it down to about 13 percent the most recent figures the last three months  the third quarter  this year the flation rate is seven percent still too high but it illustrates very vividly that  addition to providg an enormous number  9 million new jobs  the last three  a half years that the flationary threat is still urgent on us I noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan Kemp Roth proposal which his own runng mate rge Bush described as boudu economics  said that it would result  a 30% flation rate  week which is not a democratic publication said that this Reagan contra proposal  I quote them I thk was completely irresponsible  would result  flationary pressures which would destroy this nation so our proposals are very sound  very carefully consid
1568,1.0,ered to stimulate jobs to improve the dustrial complex  this country to create tools for American workers  at the same time would be antiflationary  nature so to add 9 million new jobs to control flation  to plan for the future was a energy policy now tact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead mr. Ellis do you have a followup question from mr. Carter yes mr. president you have mentioned the creation  9 million new jobs at the same time the unemployment rate still hangs high as does the flation rate now I wonder can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue  a second admistration  order to try to brg down that flation rate  would it be an act  leadership to tell the American people they're gog to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come yes we have demed that the American people sacrifice  they've done very well as a matter  fact we're importg today about onethird less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago we've had a 25% reductio
1569,1.0,"n sce the first year I was  fice at the same time as I said earlier we have added about 9 million net new jobs  that period  time a record never before achieved also the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors one conservation which requires sacrifice  the other one crease  production  American energy which is gog along very well more coal this year than ever before  history more oil  gas wells drilled this year than ever before  history a new economic revitalization program that we have  md which will be implemented next year would result  tax credits which would let busess vest  new tools  new factories to create even more new jobs about a million  the next two years  we also have planned a Youth Employment Program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people this has already passed the House now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate now the same question goes to governor Reagan governor Reagan would you like to have the question repeated governor Reagan du"
1570,1.0,rg the past four years the Consumer Price Index has risen from .8% to currently over 12%  perhaps more significantly the nation's broader underlyg rate  flation has gone up from 7 to 9 percent now a part  that has been due to external factors beyond US control  notably the more than doublg  OPEC oil prices last year which leads me to ask you whether sce the United States remas vulnerable to such external shocks can flation  fact be controlled if so specifically what measures would you pursue mr. Ellis I thk this idea that has been spawned here  our country that flation somehow came upon us like a plague  therefore it's uncontrollable  no one can do anythg about it is entirely spurious  it's dangerous to say this to the people when mister Carter became president flation was .8% as you said it had been cut  two by President Gerald Ford it is now runng at twelve pot seven percent President Carter also has spoken  the new jobs created what we always with the normal growth  our country an c
1571,1.0,rease  population crease the number  jobs but that can't hide the fact that there are 8 million men  women out  work  America today  2 million  those lost their jobs  just the last few months mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight agast flation  yet his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity  gross national product  crease unemployment  order to get a hle on flation because   January at the begng  the year it was more than 18% sce then he has blamed to the people for flation OPEC he's blamed the Federal Reserve System he has braed the lack  productivity the American people he has then accused the people  livg too well  that we must share  scarcity we must sacrifice  get used to dog with less we don't have flation because the people are livg too well we have flation because the government is livg too well  the last statement just a few days ago was a speech to the effect that we have flation because government revenues 
1572,1.0,have not kept pace with government spendg I see my time is runng out here I'll have to get this down very fast yes you can lick flation by creasg productivity  by decreasg the cost  government to the place that we have balanced budgets  are no longer runng grdg out prtg press money floodg the market with it because the government is spendg more than it takes   my economic plan calls for that the president's economic plan calls for creasg the taxes to the pot that we fally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget  that way but we'll have a very poor nation  a very unsound economy if we follow that path followup mr. Ellis yes you have centered on cuttg government spendg  what you have just said about your own policies you have also said that you would crease defense spendg specifically where would you cut government spendg if you were to crease defense spendg  also cut taxes so that presumably federal revenues would shrk well most people when they thk about 
1573,1.0,cuttg government spendg they thk  terms  elimatg necessary programs or wipg out somethg some service that government is supposed to perform I believe that there is enough extravagance  fact  government as a matter  fact one  the secretaries  hgw under mr. Carter testified that he thought there was 7 billion dollars worth  fraud  waste  welfare   the medical programs associated with it we've had the General Accountg Office estimate that there is probably tens  billions  dollars that is lost  fraud alone  they have added that waste adds even more to that we have a program for a gradual reduction  government spendg based on these theories  I have a task force now that has been workg on where those cuts could be made I'm confident that it can be done  that it will reduce flation because I did it  California  flation went down below the national average  California when we returned money to the people  reduced government spendg President Carter Governor Reagan's proposal the Rigg Kim Roth p
1574,1.0,roposal is one  the most highly flationary ideas it ever has been presented to the American public he would actually have to cut government spendg by at least a hundred  thirty billion dollars  order to balance  budget under this ridiculous proposal I noticed that his task force is workg for his future plans had some  their ideas revealed  the    this week one  those ideas was to repeal the mimum wage  several times this year governor Reagan has said that the major cause  unemployment is the mimum wage this is a heartless kd  approach to the workg families  our country which is typical  many an leaders  the past but I thk has been accentuated under governor Reagan  California I'm surprised governor Reagan brought this up he had the three largest tax creases  the history  that state under his admistration he more than doubled state spendg while he was governor 122 percent crease  had between a twenty  thirty percent crease  the number  employees sarahdan  California  thank you sir it's 
1575,1.0,governor Reagan has the last word on this question yes the figures that the president has just used about California is a distortion  the situation there because while I was governor  California our spendg  California creased less per capita than the spendg  rgia while mr. Carter was governor  rgia  the same four years the size  government creased only onesixth  California  what it creased  proportion to population  rgia  the idea that my tax cut proposal is flationary I would like to ask the president why is it flationary to let the people keep more  their money  spend it the way they'd like  it isn't flationary to let him take that money  spend it the way he wants I wish that question need not be rhetorical but it must be because we run out  time on that now the the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard yes governor Reagan the decle   our cities has been hastened by the contual rise  crime strange race relations to fall  the quality  public education the persistence
1576,1.0,  abnormal poverty  a rich nation  a decle  the services to the public the signs seem to pot toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment  a permanent underclass  the cities what specifically would you do  the next four years to reverse this trend I have been talkg to a number  congressmen who have much the same idea that I have  that is that  the ner city areas that  cooperation with local government  with national government  usg tax centives  wouldn't Kapil cooperation with the private sector but we have development zones let the local entity the city declare this particular area based on the stards  the percentage  people on welfare unemployed  so forth  that area  then through tax centives duce the creation  busesses providg jobs  so forth  those areas the elements  government through these tax centives for example a busess that would not have for a period  time an crease  the property tax reflectg its development  the unused property that it was makg wouldn't be an
1577,1.0,y loss to the city because the city isn't gettg any tax that now  it would simply be a delay  on the other h many  the people that would then be given jobs are presently Ward's  the government  it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax centive because they that wouldn't be costg government anythg either I thk there are thgs to do  this regard I stood  the South Bronx on the exact spot the President Carter stood on  1977 you have to see it to believe it it looks like a bombed out city great gaunt skeletons  buildgs wdows smashed out pated on one  them unkept promises on another despair  this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was gog to brg  a vast program to rebuild this department there are hope for this area there are whole blocks  l that are left bare just bulldoze down flat  nothg has been done  they are now chargg to take tourists through there to see this terrible desolation I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question do I have reason 
1578,1.0,to hope that I can someday take care  my family aga nothg has been done followup mr. Hilliard yes governor Reagan blacks  other nonwhites are creasg  numbers  our cities many  them feel that they are facg a hostility from whites that prevents them from jog the economic mastream  our society there is racial confrontation  the schools on jobs   housg is nonwhite seek to reap the benefits  a free society what do you thk is the nation's future as a multiracial society I believe  it I am eternally optimistic  I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young  when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem I know those thgs can grow out  despair  an ner city when there's hopelessness at at home lack  work  so forth but I believe that all  us together  I believe the presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was it's a bully pulpit  I thk that somethg can be done from there because the goal for all  us should be that one day thgs will be done neithe
1579,1.0,r because  nor  spite  any  the differences between us ethnic differences or racial justice differences whatever they may be that we will have total equal opportunity for all people  I would do everythg I could  my power to brg that about mr. Hilliard would you repeat your question for President Carter President Carter the decle  our cities has been hastened by the contual rise  crime straed race relations the fall  the quality  public education the persistence  abnormal poverty  a rich nation  a decle  services to the public the signs seem to pot toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment  a permanent underclass  the cities what specifically would you do  the next four years to reverse this trend Thank You mr. Yeo when I was campaigng  1976 everywhere I went the mayors  local ficials were  despair about the rapidly deterioratg central cities  our nation we itiated a very fe urban renewal program workg with the mayors the governors  other terested ficials this has been
1580,1.0, a very successful effort that's one  the ma reasons that we've had such an crease  a number  people employed other ne million people put to work  new jobs sce I've been  fice 1.3 million  those has been among black Americans  another million among those who speak Spanish we're now planng to contue the revitalization program with creased commitments  Rapid Transit mass transit under the wdfall prits tax we expect to spend about forty three billion dollars  the next ten years to rebuild a transportation systems  our country we also are pursug the housg programs we've had a 73% crease  the allotment  federal funds for improved education these are the kds  efforts worked on a jot basis with community leaders particularly  a mority areas  essential cities that had been deterioratg so  the past it's very important to us that this be done with the full volvement  mority citizens I brought to that level top levels  government to the white house to admistrative fices  the executive branch  it 
1581,1.0,to the judicial system highly qualified black  Spanish citizens  women who  the past had been excluded I noticed that governor Reagan said it when he was a young a man that there was no knowledge  a racial problem  this country those who suffered from discrimation because  race or sex certaly knew we had a racial problem we have gone a long way toward correctg these problems but we still have a long way to go the followup question this President Carter liked me see repeat the same followup to you blacks  other nonwhites are creasg  numbers  our cities many  them feel that they are facg a hostility from whites that prevents them from jog the economic mastream  our society there is racial confrontation  the schools on jobs   housg is nonwhite seek to reap the benefits  a free society what is your assessment  the nation's as a future  multiracial society ours is a nation  refugees a nation  immigrants almost all  our citizens came here from other ls  now have hopes which are beg realized 
1582,1.0,for a better life preservg their ethnic commitments they are family structures their religious beliefs preservg their relationships with their relatives  foreign countries but still filmg themselves together  a very coherent society which gives our nation  strength  the past those mority groups have ten been excluded from participation  the affairs  government sce I've been president I've appoted for stance more than twice as many black federal judges as all previous presidents  the history  this country I've done the same thg  the appotment  women's  also spanishspeakg Americans to volve them  admistration  government  a feelg that they belong to this sanal structure that makes decisions  the judiciary  an executive branch is a very important commitment which I am tryg to realize  contue to do so  the future governor Reagan you have a mute for rebuttal yes the president talks  government programs  they have their place but as governor when I was at that end  the le  receivg some  thes
1583,1.0,e grants for government programs I saw that so many  them were dead end they were public employment for these people who really want to get out to the private job market where there are jobs with a future now the president spoke a moment ago about that I was agast the mimum wage I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group  teenagers who were black  who were tellg me about their unemployment problems  that it was the mimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get  deed every time it is creased you will fd that there was an crease  mority unemployment among young people  therefore I have been  favor  a separate mimum for them with regard to the great progress that has been made with his government spendg the rate  black unemployment  Detroit Michigan is 56 percent President Carter you have the last word on this question well it's obviously we still have a long way to go  fully corporatg the mority groups to the mastream  American life we have made good
1584,1.0, progress  there's no doubt  my md that the commitment to unemployment compensation the mimum wage welfare national health surance those kds  commitments that have typify the Democratic Party sce ancient history  this country's political life are a very important element  the future  all those elements Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out agast them which to me shows a very great sensitivity to givg deprive families a better chance  life this to me is a very important difference between him  me  this election  I believe the American people will judge accordgly there is no doubt  my md that  the downtown central cities with the with the new commit on an energy policy with a chance to revitalize homes  to make them more fuel efficient with a chance for synthetic synthetic fuels program solar power this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends thank you gentlemen now for the fourth question to President Carter from Barbara Walters mr. president th
1585,1.0,e eyes  the country tonight are on the hostages  Iran I realize this is a sensitive area but the question  how we respond to acts  terrorism goes beyond this current crisis other countries have policies that determe how they will respond Israel for example considers hostages like soldiers  will not negotiate with terrorists for the future mr. president the country has the right to know do you have a policy for dealg with terrorism wherever it might happen  what have we learned from this experience  Iran that might cause us to do thgs differently if this was somethg similar happens aga probably one  the blights on this world is a threat  the activities  terrorists at one  the recent economic summit conferences between myself  the other leaders  the Western world we committed ourselves to take strong action agast terrorism airplane hijackg was one  the elements  that commitment there is no doubt that we have seen  recent years  recent months additional acts  violence agast Jews  France  
1586,1.0, course agast those who live  Israel by the PLO  other terrorist organizations ultimately the most serious terrorist threat is if one  those radical nations who believe  terrorism  a policy should have atomic weapons both I  all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controllg the proliferation  nuclear weapons  countries like Libya or Iraq we have even a donated some  our closest trade partners because we have sisted upon the control  the spread  nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries when Governor Reagan has been askg then he makes a very disturbg comment that nonproliferation or the control  the spread  nuclear weapons is none  our busess  when he was asked specifically recently about Iraq he said there's nothg we can do about it this ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome  all  it's part  a pattern where our country must st firm to control terrorism  all kds ms walters followup yes while we are discussg policy header an not taken American hostages I
1587,1.0, assume that  order to preserve our neutrality we would have stopped the flow  spare parts  vital war materials once war broke out between Iraq  Iran now we are free to lift the ban on such Goods if they let our people come home doesn't this reward tourism compromise our neutrality  possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us  the Middle East we will mata our position  neutrality  the Iran  Iraq war we have no plans to sell additional material or goods to Iran that might be  a warlike nature when I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result  a takg  our hostages I then  have consistently mataed sce then that if the hostages are released safely that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns which they have bought  paid for also that the frozen Iranian assets would be released that's been a consistent policy one I tend to carry out but you repeat the question now for governor Reagan please miss Walters yes governor the eyes  the country tonight rema on the ho
1588,1.0,stages  Iran but the question  how we respond to acts  terrorism goes beyond this current crisis there are other countries that have policies that determe how they will respond Israel for example considers hostages like soldiers  will not negotiate with terrorists for the future the country has the right to know do you have a policy for dealg with terrorism wherever it might happen  what have we learned from this experience  Iran that might cause us to do thgs differently if this was somethg similar should happen aga Barbara you there's that question twice I thk you ought to have at least one answer to it I am I have been accused  lately  havg a secret plan with regard to the hostages now this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times durg this campaign to the press which is that the question would be have you any ideas  what you would do if you were there  I said well yes  I thk that anyone that's seekg this position as well as other people probably have thought to themsel
1589,1.0,ves what about this what about that these are just ideas  what I would thk  if I were  that position  had access to the formation  which I would know all the options that were open to me I have never answered the question however second the one that says well tell me what are some  those ideas first  all I would be fearful that I might say somethg that was presently under way or  negotiations  thus expose it  endanger the hostages  sometimes I thk some  my ideas might volve quiet diplomacy where you don't say  advance or say to anyone what it is you're thkg  dog your question is difficult to answer because  the situation right now no one wants to say anythg that would advertently delay  any way the return  those hostages if they're if there is a chance  their comg home soon or that might cause them harm what I do thk should be done once they are safely here with their families  that tragedy is over  we've endured this humiliation for just lackg one week  a year now then I thk it is tim
1590,1.0,e for us to have a complete vestigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made  the begng why they have been there so long  when they come home what did we have to do  order to brg that about what arrangements were made  I would suggest that Congress should hold such an vestigation  the meantime I'm gog to contue prayg they'll come home followup question I would like to say that neither cidate answered specifically the question  a specific policy for dealg with terrorism but I will ask governor Reagan a different to followup question you've had suggested that there would be no Iranian crisis had you been president because we would have given firmer support to the Shah but around is a country  37 million people who are resistg a government they regarded as dictatorial my question is not whether the Shahs regime was preferable to the ayatollahs but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determe what form  government any country will have  do we back unpopular
1591,1.0, regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States the degree  unpopularity  a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism I should say  the alternative government makes one wonder whether you are beg helpful to the people  we've been guilty  that because someone didn't meet exactly our stards  human rights even though they were an ally  ours stead  tryg patiently to persuade them to change their ways we have  a number  stances aided a revolutionary overthrow which results  complete totalitarianism stead for those people  I thk that this is a kd  a hypocritical policy when at the same time we are matag a date on with the one nation  the world where there are no human rights at all the Soviet Union now there was a second phase  the Iranian affair  which we had somethg to do with that  that was we had adequate warng that there was a threat to our embassy  we could have done what other embassies did either strengthen our security there or remove
1592,1.0, our personnel before the kidnap  the takeover took place the other one I'm sorry I must terrupt President Carter you have a mute for rebuttal I didn't hear any comment from governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism  the future what the Western lies did decide to do is to stop all air flights commercial air flights to any nation volved  terrorism or the hijackg  airplanes  the harborg  high jackers secondly we all committed ourselves as have all my predecessors  the Oval Office not to permit the spread  nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives third not to make any sales  material or weapons to a nation which is volved  terrorist activities  lastly not to deal with the PLO until  unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist  recognizes UN resolution 22 as a basis for Middle East peace these are a few  the thgs to which our nation is committed  we will contue wi
1593,1.0,th these commitments Governor Reagan you have the last word on that question yes I have no quarrel whatsoever with the thgs that have been done because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries  the world made it pla that there is no room worldwide for terrorism there will be no negotiation with terrorists  any kd  while I have a last word here I would like to correct a misstatement  fact by the president's I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation  nuclear proliferation or the tryg to halt it would be a major part  a foreign policy  me thank you gentlemen that is the first half  the debate now the rules for the second half quite simple they're only complicated when I expla them the second half the panel is with me we'll have no followup questions stead after the panelists have asked a question the cidates have answered each  the cidates will have two opportunities to follow up to question to rebut or just a comment on his opponent state
1594,1.0,ment governor Reagan will respond  this section to the first question from Marv stone governor Reagan arms control the president said it was the sgle most important issue both  you who have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia but by methods that are vastly different you suggest that we scrap the salt 2 treaty already negotiated  tensify the buildup  American power  to duce the Soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to us yes President Carter on the other h says he will aga a try to convce a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty  the grounds it's the best we can hope to get now both  you cannot be right will you tell us why you thk you are yes I thk I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy a strong America  a strong economy  then as we build up our national security to restore our marg  safety we at the same time try to restra the Soviet buildup which has been gog forward a rapid pace  for quite some time the 
1595,1.0,salt 2 treaty was the result  negotiations  mr. Carter's team entered to after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion  actual reduction  nuclear strategic weapons  his emissary I thk came home  12 hours with havg heard a very defite net but takg that one no from the Soviet Union we then went back to negotiations on their terms because mister Carter had canceled the b1 bomber delayed the MX delayed the Trident submare delayed the cruise missile shut down the missile man the three the Muteman missile production le  whatever other thgs that might have been done the Soviet Union sat at the table knowg that we had gone forward with unilateral considerate concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever now I have not blocked the salt ii treaty as carter mr. Mondale suggests that I have it has been blocked by a Senate  which there is a Democratic majority deed the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0 with 7 abstentions agast the salt 2 treaty  declared that it was 
1596,1.0,not  the national security terests  the United States besides which it is illegal because the law  the l passed by Congress says we cannot accept a treaty  which we are not equal  we're not equal  this treaty for one reason alone our b52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons their backfire bombers are not the governor I have to terrupt you at that pot the time's up for that but the same question now to President Carter yes President Carter both  you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms wave race with Russia but through vastly different methods the governor suggests we scrap the salt 2 treaty which you negotiated  Vienna are signed  Vienna  tensify the buildup  American power to duce the Soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to us you on the other h say you will aga try to convce a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it is the best we can hope to get from the Russians you cannot both be right will you tell us why you thk you are
1597,1.0, yes I'd be glad to flation unemployment the cities all very important issues but they pale to significance  the life  duties  a president when compared with the control  nuclear weapons every president who has served  the Oval Office sce Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition  controllg nuclear weapons to negotiate with the Soviet Union balanced controlled observable  then reducg levels  atomic weaponry there is a disturbg pattern  the attitude  Governor Reagan he has never supported any  those arms control agreements the limited test ban salt one nor that the the antiballistic missile treaty nor the Vladivostok treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford  now he wants to throw to the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced  equal basis between ourselves  the Soviet Union over a sevenyear period by myself  my two an predecessors the Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty there have been prelimary skirmishg x'  t
1598,1.0,he Committees  the Senate but the treaty has never come to the floor  the Senate for either a debate or a vote it's understable that a senator  the prelimary debate can make an irresponsible statement or maybe an illadvised statement you've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake if it is a mistake but when a man who hopes to be president says take this treaty discard it do not vote do not debate do not explore the issues do not fally capitalize on this law negotiation that is a very dangerous  disturbg thg governor Reagan you have an opportunity to rebut that yes I'd like to respond very much first  all the Soviet Union if I have been critical  some  the previous agreements is because we've been out negotiated for quite a long time  they have managed  spite  all  our attempts at arms limitation to to go forward with the biggest military buildup  the history  man now to suggest that because two an presidents tried to pass the sole Trudy treaty that puts them on its side I would l
1599,1.0,ike to say a president Ford who was with 90 percent  an a tree  treaty that we could be  agreement with when he left fice is emphatically agast this salt treaty I would like to pot out also that senators like Henry Jackson  Hollgs  South Carola they are takg the lead  the fight agast this particular treaty I am NOT talkg  scrappg I am talkg  takg the treaty back  gog back to negotiations  I would say to the Soviet Union we will sit  negotiate with you as long as it takes to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction  these nuclear weapons to the pot that neither one  us represents a threat to the other that is hardly throwg away a treaty  beg opposed to arms limitation President Carter yes governor Reagan is makg some very misleadg  disturbg statements he not only advocates the scrappg  his treaty  I don't know that these men as he quotes or agast the treaty  his fal form but he also advocates the possibility he said it's been a missg element  playg a trump card a
1600,1.0,gast the Soviet Union  a nuclear arms race  sistg upon nuclear superiority by our own nation as a predication for negotiation  the future with the Soviet Union if president Brezhnev said we will scrap this treaty negotiated under three American presidents over a sevenyear period  time we sist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations  we believe that the launchg  a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations it's obvious that I as president  all Americans would reject such a proposition this would mean the resumption  a very dangerous nuclear arms race it would be very disturbg to American people it would change the basic tone  commitment that our nation has experienced ever sce the Second  War with all presidents Democratic  an  would also be very disturbg to our allies all  whom support this nuclear arms treaty  addition  that the adversarial relationship between ourselves  the Soviet Union would undoubtedly terior eight very rapidly this attitude is e
1601,1.0,xtremely dangerous  belligerent  his tone although it's said with a quiet voice Governor Reagan I know the president's supposed to be replyg to me but sometimes I have a hard time  connectg what he's sayg with what I have said or what my positions are sometimes thk it's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure little work the my pot I have made already mr. president with regard to negotiatg it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part  the United States it is calls for a mutual reduction  these weapons as I say to the pot that neither  us can represent a threat to the other  to suggest that the salt to treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a contuation  based on all  the precedg efforts by two previous presidents is just not true it was a new negotiation because as I say President Ford was with about 10%  havg a solution that could be acceptable  I thk our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair  verifiable salt agreem
1602,1.0,ent President Carter you have the last word on this question I thk to close out this discussion it would be better to put to perspective what we're talkg about I had a discussion with my daughter Amy the other day before I came here to ask you what the most important issue was she said she thought nuclear weaponry city  the control  nuclear arms this is a formidable force some  these weapons have 10 megatons  explosion if you put 50 tons  TNT  each one  railroad cars you would have a car load  TNT a traload  TNT stretchg across this nation that's one major war explosion  a warhead we have thouss equivalent  Megaton or million tons  TNT warheads the control  these weapons is the sgle major responsibility  a president  to cast down this commitment  all presidents because  some slight technicalities it can be corrected is a very dangerous approach we have to go to another question now from Harry Ellis to President Carter mr. president as you have said Americans through conservation are im
1603,1.0,portg much less oil today than we were even a year ago yet u.s. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage  total imports is today much higher than it at the time  the 1973 Arab oil embargo  for some time to come the loss  substantial amounts  Arab oil could plunge the u.s. to depression now this means that a bridge must be built out  this dependence can the United States develop synthetic fuels  other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment  will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families I don't thk is it  doubt that  the future the cost  oil is gog to go up what I've had is a basic commitment sce I've been as president is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil it can only be done  two ways one to conserve energy to stop the waste  energy  secondly to produce more American energy we've been very successful  both cases we've now reduced the importg  foreign oil  the last year alone by onethird we imported today 2 million barrels  oil less than
1604,1.0, we did the same day just a year ago this commitment has been openg up a very bright Vista for our nation  the future because with the wdfall prits tax as a base we now have an opportunity to use American technology an American ability an American natural resources to exp rapidly the production  synthetic fuels yes to exp rapidly the production  solar energy yes  also to produce a conventional kds  American energy we will drill more oil  gas wells this year than any year  history will produce more coal this year than any year  history we are exportg more coal this year than any year  history  we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems improved loadg facilities  our ports to see a very good opportunity on a world ternational market to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source this excitg future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life  to have Milly  new jobs associated
1605,1.0, with this new  very dynamic dustry now  prospect because  the new energy policy that we put to effect would you repeat the question now for governor Reagan governor Reagan Americans through conservation are importg much less oil today than we were even a year ago  yet us reliance on Arab oil as a percentage  total imports is much higher today than it was durg the 1973 Arab oil embargo  the substantial loss  Arab oil could plunge the United States to depression the question is whether the development  alternative energy sources  order to reduce this dependence can be done without damagg the environment  will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as beg energy poor when it is energy rich the coal that the president mentioned yes we have it  yet oneeighth  our total coal resources is not beg utilized at all right now the mes ar

1608,1.0,same high air  water pollution stards to triple the amount  coal we produce Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy which is already proven its effectiveness is to repeal or to change substantially the wdfall prits tax to return a major portion  227 billion dollars back to the oil companies to do away with the Department  Energy to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program to put a mimal mm emphasis on solar power to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source  energy  the future he wants to put all our eggs  one basket  give that basket to the major oil companies governor Reagan that is a misstatement  course  my position I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job producg the thgs that people need then government can the Department  Energy has a multibillion dollar budget  excess  ten billion dollars it hasn't produced a quart  oil or a lump  coal or anythg else  the le  energy  for the mr.

1610,1.0,objections  Governor Reagan  this is a very wellknown fact also recently when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety  Health Act should be abolished governor Reagan responded amen the fshore drillg rights is a question that governor Reagan raises ten as a matter  fact  the proposal for the aska ls legislation a hundred percent  all the fshore ls would be open for exploration  netyfive percent  all the aska ls where it is suspected or believe that meral merals might exist we have with our fiveyear plan for the leasg  fshore ls proposed more l to be drilled than has been opened up for drillg sce this program first started  195 so we are not puttg restrats on American exploration we're encouragg it  every way we can governor Reagan you have the last word on this question yes if it is a wellknown fact that I opposed air pollution laws  California the only thg I can possibly thk  is that the President must be suggestg the law that the federal government tried to impose on the state 
1611,1.0, California not a law regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile with the city limits  any California city or have a place to put it if you did drive it agast their regulations it would have destroyed the economy  California  I must say we had the support  Congress when we poted out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency we still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws  the country as for fshore oil only 2% now is so leased  is producg oil the the rest as to whether the open the ls are gog to be opened  the next five years or so we're already five years behd  what we should be dog there is more oil now  the wells that have been drilled than has been taken out  120 years one years that they've been drilled Thank You governor Thank You mr. president the next question goes to governor Reagan from William Hilliard governor Reagan wage earners  this country especially the young are supportg a social security system that
1612,1.0, contues to affect their come drastically the system is fosterg a struggle between the young  the oil  is driftg the country toward a polarization  these two groups how much longer can the young wageearner expect to bear the evercreasg burden  the Social Security system the Social Security system was based on a false premise with regard to how fast the number  workers would crease  how fast the number  retirees would crease it is actually out  balance  this first became evident about 16 years ago  some  us were voicg warngs then now it is trillions  dollars out  balance  the only answer that has come so far is the biggest sgle tax crease  our nation's history the payroll tax crease for Social Security which will only put a baid on this  postpone the day  reckong by a few years at most what is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force to look  experts to look to this entire problem as to how it can be reformed  made actuarially sound but with the premise that no one present
1613,1.0,ly depended on Social Security is gog to have the rug pulled out from under them  not get their check we cannot frighten as we have with the threats  the campaign rhetoric that is gog on  this campaign our senior citizens leave them thkg that  some way they're endangered  they would have no place to turn they must contue to get those checks  I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis but it's gog to take some study  some work  not just passg a tax crease to let the load or the ro fall  on the next admistration would you repeat that question for President Carter yes President Carter wage earners  this country especially the young are supportg a Social Security system that contues to affect their come drastically the system is fosterg a struggle between young  old  is driftg the country toward a polarization  these two groups how much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the evercreasg burden  the Social Security system as long as as a Democratic president
1614,1.0,  the White House we will have a strong  viable Social Security system free  the threat  bankruptcy although governor Reagan has changed his position lately on four different occasions he has advocated makg Social Security a voluntary system which would  effect very quickly bankrupt it I noticed also  the    earlier this week that a prelimary report  his task force advocates makg Social Security more sound by reducg the adjustments  Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact  flation these kds  approaches are very dangerous to the security  the wellbeg  a peace  md  the retired people  this country  those approachg retirement age but no matter what it takes  the future to keep Social Security sound it must be kept that way  although there was a serious threat to the Social Security system  its tegrity durg the 1976 campaign  when I became president the action  the Democratic Congress workg with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound fancial basis th
1615,1.0,at's a way it will stay  Governor Reagan well that just isn't true it is I said delayed the actuarial imbalance fallg on us for just a few years with that crease  taxes  I don't believe we can go on creasg the tax because the problem for the young people today is that they're payg  far more than they can ever expect to get out now aga this statement that somehow I wanted to destroy it  I just changed my tune that I was for voluntary Social Security which would mean the ru  it mr. president the voluntary thg that I suggested many years ago was that a young man orphaned  raised by an aunt who died his aunt was eligible for Social Security surance because she was not his mother  I suggested that if this is an surance program certaly the person who's payg  should be able to name his own beneficiaries  that's the closest I've ever come do anythg voluntary with Social Security I to  pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens  ours they're gog to contue to g

1617,1.0,he past the relationship between Social Security  Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum  aid for senior citizens  the retention  health benefits Governor Reagan as a matter  fact began his political career campaigng around this nation agast Medicare now we have an opportunity to move toward national health surance with an emphasis on the prevention  disease an emphasis on outpatient care not patient care an emphasis on Hospital cost contament to hold down the cost  hospital care for those who are ill  emphasis own catastrophic health surance so that if a family is threatened with beg wiped out economically because the very  a very high medical bill then the surance would help pay for it these are the kd   a national health surance important to the American people governor Reagan aga typically is agast such a proposal governor now you go aga when I opposed Medicare there was another piece  legislation meang the same problem before the Congress I happen to favor the ot

Carter's given tonight that he seeks the solution to anythg as another opportunity for a federal government program I happen to believe that the federal government has usurped powers  autonomy autonomy  authority that belongs back at the state  local level it has imposed on the dividual freedoms  the people  that there are more  these thgs that could be solved by the people themselves if they were given a chance or by the levels  government that we

1643,1.0,this is playg itself out  is that your view where you thk Donald Trump wants to take the country I don't thk he wants to take it back to the precivil other you're you're confirmed with exria Ocasio Cortez at just that that Ronald Reagan was a racist not very long ago as well as FDR no I thk that what he's tryg to say let's make America great is  the narrowest sense there's no reason why the United States had should have not achieve annualized GDP  3% sce 2006  why why can't we have a record low mority unemployment  record P stood near three pot seven three pot eight we're almost record peacetime unemployment  who says that we that there is such a thg as peak oil  perhaps maybe we can add three million barrels  oil production sce he's so there was no artificially imposed politically clear limits  then he looked at a time where he fell that this country when Reagan was governor was about so I don't like to use those term because we're all mixed up  many families they don't really mean it
1644,1.0, very much unless you're Elizabeth Ward  you have a DNA test but we were about 90 percent socalled white  then maybe twelve ten percent socalled africanamerican  Lato but  every culture that has a domant population there's problems there is an Iraq there's a one what was unique about the United States that was baked to our foundg that all men are created equal so you had a constant process  self correction  selfcriticism  we were evolvg to what had happened with the Italian experience where Italians came they were mostly democratic  today if her name is Giuliani or Pelosi you don't know what your why your ethnic cachet you can't tell that was the goal  I thk we were workg toward that  so when what Trump says that I thk he thks that race or ethnicity should be cidental not essential to your persona but what's happened that almost everythg is politicized  ethnic or identity politics term that the immigration has now become a demographic Club to beat the opposition with  that we're suppos

1646,1.0,age  you know if everyone  this audience when you thk Ronald Reagan many many thk  this the Great Communicator he boy could he use words right  your book you talk about when President Trump uses words ten times you thk he's quote clumsily exaggerates you know Trump's beg Trump like Reagan was Reagan you know if you could wave a magic w  all  a sudden Trump could be remarkable communicator  sensitive with his tweets  thgs like that you know would Trump be Trump I'm tryg to determe if this is someone you know yeah sure we'll fix him but I don't know that Trump would be Trump I tend to agree with that  you know everybody who has bet on the opposite pot  view sayg if he would just stop tweetg if he would just exp his vocabulary beyond a thous words or people just say there are more adjectives  the English language than awesome tremendous our adverbs like ley but I don't thk I thk you're right I thk what Trump is  all  his tweet Twitter wars he's reactive he rarely starts a fight he didn't 
1647,1.0,start with : Kaepernick he didn't even start with his probably most notorious one with John McCa well I thought was a mistake for him to to besmirch John McCa but but McCa had called his supporters crazies  Trump was reactg to that when he was asked about it so he's reactive  he tries to brg more mega tonnage  the reply than the if the attacker  then you're very unwise because most people have a selfimage  Trump's actually been  a wrestlg match physically so if you want to get to a wrestlg match with him you're gonna lose because he doesn't care he's been  it  he doesn't have a sense  I mean everybody has a positive sense  self but it remds me I said to somebody  New York if you were to rate a B  C D partylist where would the Trump's be  he said F  I thought that was one  the reasons I liked it  there was somethg have you noticed when that I mentioned this but when Trump went places he had this tight tie  the hair  everythg so if he was  abama or Bakersfield or Flt Michigan he had the 
1648,1.0,same act Queens accent he was authentically Trump when he'll we went to the south or New Engl it was you all  Boilermakers  bowlg when Obama went  the ner city he sounded like he could drop his G's when John Kerry was runng he had camouflage  ducks by the neck  I asked he came to Tulare California  I thought even Trump's gonna have to work cowboy hat no he just stood out he had his suit the long tie  the Queen's accent so people did what no would thought would be possible how could people identify as a populist a Manhattan billionaire with a Queens accent that very little cut he pulled f appearg more authentically pot populist than a real populist like John Casey CH who grew up as he always remded us as a son  a postman though there are so many paradoxes that we haven't really figured them all out yet with Tom you know I'm not sure I thk Trump vented that he certaly is quite used the term fake news  you know I've watched from the very start as he used that expression it was you know we
1649,1.0,ll sce news he either doesn't like or he thks just pla not written fairly that's what you know to Trump is fake news but I got the sense that as he started gettg more  more successful  convcg people that these news stories are just pla unfair  called it fake news the media took the bait  it feels to me like as much as they dislike Trump there now have squit have pressed editorial to news reportg  they really he's positioned them as the enemy  they've positioned him as the entity the second part  what's surprisg to me that almost don't mask the American media yeah would step across the le  show a visceral hatred  news reportg have you seen a precedent for that is no  we can we can say thgs but there are is data that liberal Shorenste Center at  said that the first six months  what's been worse was 85% negative coverage Obama was only 0 five  then got much better  Trump's down to 90% these six months bla we've never seen movie stars that compete whether it's Johnny Depp or Robert De Niro
1650,1.0, or Madonna or Kathy Griff they have a competition whether they can decapitate him burn him blow him up stab him  then we've never seen the admistrative state or the progressive media Nexus the moment he's elected let's sue for the let's sue to abort his presidency  three states by the the votg maches no let's try to persuade the electors not to follow their constitution remember those ads don't vote for him  then almost immediately 60s plus house representatives troduced articles impeachment for each set awarded  then we had the Logan act that's calcified we don't use it you then it was the 25th amendment that he was crazy they had a psychiatrist justify  then we had the Muller the hysteria about collusion with the steel fabricated stuff  then we had the Muller the look September 5th  last year we had anonymous  the New York Times remember said he's actively along with loyal Americans tryg to thwart the president I don't know what the McCabe Rosenste do you guys know it was kd   palac

1658,1.0,nials  mr. teal turned to me  said no actually Trump has the best analytics  the world said he does he said yes he's concentratg on the only states that mattered we know everybody said how would you know  he said I designed them  so there were people who helped that campaign  various ways that didn't get a lot  credit but deserve a lot  credit Mike Reagan was a transitional transformative president there's no doubt about it just he also noted that Trump picked up on 80%  what's been the Reagan an playbook for many years do you thk that what's Trump is succeedg  dog is will he be viewed  the future as a transformational president that it's very hard to tell because let's take wrong Reagan at the begng  1983 we were still  recession he was tryg to break flation we had been so desperate to break it we we had whip you know whip flation now buttons  I was farmg I remember an 83 I went to the production credit we had a family farm  I thought I was so lucky to get a 13% loan  I bought a used 
1659,1.0,pickup for neteen  a half percent I thought that was high  then I had sulfur bags that I'd ordered sulfur  I noticed that it said $.99 $5.99 $6.99 they crossed out the price the flation was so high that they were markg them up  their ventory so  that was when Reagan was president  then I noticed every time he turned on the TV  83  if you remember there was a Hollywood movie about the end  days wagon was gonna cause a nuclear or wner I thk they even Carl Sagan was always her hectorg us about Reagan so Trump is that that that position you know  Reagan took a lot  heat  broke the back  flation restored fiscal sobriety but it took really if you look at November  1983  you go back  look at polls the unnamed Democratic cidate was runng sort  neckneck  then between e November  1983  November  198 the economy grew at 7% GDP it's absolutely stunng  then it was it wasn't even close so we'll see what one  the problems  writg a book is that the news changes so you have to trust historical stct  an
1660,1.0,alytics  not get caught up  the 2 hour hour but so I tried to suggest that what the the measures that he's taken I thk we're gonna make him a very successful president  he has that Reagan has tendency one  the thgs I liked about Reagan is that people told him all the time he couldn't do somethg you can't say tear down that wall you can't call it an evil empire  his attitude well it's evil as an empire why not its people  that's what Trump is you know they Trump you you can't get out  you ran to you you cannot move the embassy to Jerusalem the Council on Foreign Relations will have a fit if you get out  the Paris climate Accord that kd  stuff  he doesn't care  that empowers ya you talk  the book at at some length about this concept via the electronic lynch mob yeah the social media that permeates our society today as relates to that particular phenomenon  this specific case volvg this young fellow Nixon  the Covgton Catholic school I see that he's maybe there's some real serious attorne

1670,1.0,ng  the third year both  them had worse midterms Clton lost 52 seats Obama lost 63 seats Obama lost six Senate seats Clton lost eight Trump lost 39 House seats maybe 0  he picked up two seats  then Clton demolished Bob Dole   Obama won hily over Mitt Romney so history suggests that it's Trump's race to lose that he has that power  cumbency he's gettg better I thk his speeches are better they're longer but they're still better I thk he's skg better he had so many problems with this revolvg door cabet sees but there's somethg about this new triage  Pompeo a Secretary  State  Bolton  especially bar at when bar the other day was asked that ambush question about the emergency declaration I thk Jeff Sessions a good man but he would have probably equivocate it  who knows what rod Rosenste would have said but Barr just stood up for him  so you get the impression that they do genuely believe  the Trump message  that helps him  then he's not runng  a vacuum everybody thks that president's run  a

1697,1.0, processes that plastic  because  contamants like labels glues or liquids might only get half a ton  recycled plastic from it they would earn half a subsidy or half a PRN however an exporter can take that ton  plastic scrap contamates  all  ship it f to be recycled abroad that turn  scrap is counted as fully recycled  the full PRN subsidy is earned but no checks are made as to how much recycled plastic is actually produced  so it encourages export PRN system was designed to subsidize the recycler to help him confidence to vest  more equipment that will recycle more material that will then grow the frastructure  the  but unfortunately the system was designed but it was weighted towards the exporter for that whole bale would be eligible for a PRN whereas those as a recycler we're only eligible for what we separate  reprocess the wait for the exporter is much more attractive than that  the recycler so once it goes  this contaer the whole contaer gets issued with that evidence no direct wh

1713,1.0,ich gives you both a sense  the depth  the oceans but also that 3d environment that Ry was talkg about we have adjoed an expedition led by the scientists  the natural mission their aim is to perform a deep ocean health check to map to chart to sample to see perhaps what no one has ever seen before  even search for those rarely seen species lurkg  the shadows the dream perhaps  a sixgill shark or even a Celia camp the Do fish thought to be extct for millions  years  crucially to see what is happeng to that ten colourful coral as it faces unprecedented threats it is so important as habitat  home to millions  species the big question for the scientists is could the deeper ocean be a refuge from the dangers  climate change  even from plastic pollution that we've talked so much about at sky well we are not alone down here this is some one the red one although it's been showered by this downdraft  sediment which you will hear the team referred to as Omega out there we can see them is sub to 
1714,1.0,the yellow at the yellow one yes the yellow one what we have the red one I've already forgotten I wish they called Kensgton should we see if we can raise them actually because  there is the prcipal scientist on this amazg expedition dr. Lucy Woodall from the nectar mission  pilotg her sub is Robert Carmichael let's see if we can raise them on the ship on the air so yeah underwater telephone Kensgton Kensgton Omega come back [] I'm gonna pass you f there now to terview Lucy about the importance  [] try aga try aga hello Lucy can you hear me hello Lucy can you hear us I was just askg you about the reasons you're tryg to explore the deep [] [] Thank You Lucy I try  talk to you a little bit later thank you so the scientists have been comg down as I said very delicately tryg to take samples  some  the deep puddles that we've seen some  their the fans that are absolutely beautiful certaly  they very delicately take some  those  back up to the surface  up on the surface if we pair up we can s
1715,1.0,ee the outle  the mothership above  up there is my colleague Mark Aust mark we're up here we're safe  well amazg I just can't believe that we're seeg you  hearg you like this just I mean just give us a sense  how we feelg right now well it's well apart from beg very hot it's just quite extraordary just before we came on air we saw a white tip shark very near help down there was it to thk rom oh it was three meters away three meters away from us you never know quite what you're gog to see all above us it gets more  more blue down beneath us it's like a murky brown color it looks very very forbiddg I have to say  so the deep beneath us we already went down there to about a hundred  seventy five meters but above it looked pleasantly light I can see small fish dancg on this rocky outcrop just above  obviously it's nice to have the company  the prcipal scientist Lucy Woodall so great to be here mark but tell us a bit about where we are  just f algebra which I suppose is called the mothershi
1716,1.0,p it's a it's a supply ship but right now it's anythg but a supply ship it's sort  travellg up as first  all a TV Operations Center I don't we can see the guys workg  the porter cab that's on this deck  they've got the controls  they are the reason why those pictures from you are gettg to us  then from us beg satellited to the viewer so big television operation on this ship also the ma reason how the ship is here it's basically a mare research scientific center  I thk also we can see now pictures  the scientists hopefully  their  their little laboratory here several little laboratories here where they take samples they analyze these samples  they look at data  they take a lot  the samples back to the  so this ship anythgg butter supply ship right now Thomas More's with me you've been lookg at the pictures they're from down below you've been here as well for three weeks what do you make  what you're seeg absolutely fantastic Anna's sayg there there's you seen a white tip reef shark I im
1717,1.0,age she will see many many more I was walkg through the shallows with black tip reef sharks yesterday comg right up to my legs no harm from them but there are many other sharks down there she's gog to have a fantastic ride all right  back to you but rest assured if we lose you I'm well I don't mean lose you like that I mean lose communications with you I'll be here I'll be your backstop as if we haven't heard enough about backstops but let's go back down to Anna 137 meters below Anna yeah don't lose me mama please don't lose me I thk Bris gonna take charge  that thank goodness you're here  the fal thg to troduce is the robotic camera down here I hope hear us talk about the ROV the remotely operated vehicle it is controlled at the mothership where Mark is by highly skilled pilots I have to say  there are ten lots  images  our submersibles  beyond  is also crucially the backstop  pictures as well because it is tethered to the surface unlike us down here for when our signal drops out from
1718,1.0, this sub is probably at will at some pot it's real very dependent on what the currents are dog down here  the technology  how we are communicatg is completely pioneerg  very challengg so when you do lose up as Mark said there to expect that marvel I pick up back on the ship  the ROV is not actually perhaps we can give it away that seems there behd us okay so Mike so I can't Thomas it just a thg you can't can't we  well mark showed you algebra so let's just put that shall we  the context  the Indian Ocean the necron mission which is what we are part  is happeng  these Seychelles  the western Indian Ocean the least explored yet the most threatened  the world's oceans  we're divg f our debris  idyllic at all 700 miles southwest  the ma Seychelles isl  maje were actually though closer to Africa some 00 miles away from others there  around 270 miles northwest  Madagascar the visibility here is amazg  the sphere  perspex gives us a 270 degree view you can look above you can look even below 
1719,1.0,where our feet f  you can look left  right as we do all the time you must be very tempted to look around you all the time oh yes there's so many thgs  fact if you stay  one spot for 10 to 15 mutes you see somethg you never saw before we can also control the cameras down here as I said we are perched on a rocky outcrop there it is rechargg whoa yeah try some lights [] there we are we are literally hangg on to the seamount face the wall that builds up to the at all if you image this was an old mounta that has gradually sung to leave this enormous Lagoon  the middle  it you can fit there sizably fit Manhattan  New York  the middle  the lagoon above us  that's partly why we have such difficulty with the currents because at certa times  the day all the water floods out  all the water floods  thk it's time for a safety check regular safety checks down here the service topside topside Omega our current depth is four for three feet our headg is one Ner zero degrees like core systems are good [
1720,1.0,] a primitive leg out well we have to do that every 15 mutes so that top side as the submersible safety ficer is called can regularly keep  touch with where we are  that was very important as we descended wasn't it yeah we do regular communications checks with the surface part  that is a safety at that lose comms with us we have a set procedure we go through  eventually we'll go to the surface if you have a pregame absolutely  normally you'd be mappg the reef wouldn't you as you descend to try  check a transept a video for the scientists above  give them formation when they go back to wherever they're gog they're from all over the world aren't there the scientists up there  a remder too that we really don't know what is beneath 'less no one have got what puffed nuts this morng has ever been deeper than where we are  we don't know where what we're gog to see where would we're gog to shift direction suddenly now what is very important to remember here is that there are a number  zones pe
1721,1.0,ople used to thk that it was just the shallows  then they would thk it was the depths  now gradually they're realizg that there are many stages  between the zones are changg so for example you get the scuba zone which is not 230 perhaps 0 if you're very experienced here it would probably be naught to 20 meters because there is no decompression unit here very difficult to get help so most people divg here if they're allowed you have to have very careful permits would only get to 20 meters the first  these zones then where the scuba divers go is called the alte photic zone known as the sunlit zone enough light penetrates this upper layer  water for reefbuildg calls to thrive it's also the most exposed to the impacts  human activity so the mixed own down which is where we are now is the Misa photic zone 0 meters to about a hundred  fifty meters the middle light zone it's called ten regarded as the start  the twilight zone at this level sunlight starts to dwdle corals become flatter  thner
1722,1.0, they are more likely to be plankton eaters than use the photosynthesis at the algae side them  here you beg to see the white tip reef sharks which I mentioned we saw just before we came on air you're more likely to see the potato groupers  I'm liberal it makes mostly some  those as well  you might see that this is perhaps a refuge from some  those dangers that I mentioned next is a new zone that people have found they thought beneath us the life would tail away with his very little light from the surface  it became creasgly difficult to see life beneath us but now confirmed  a previous negative omission  fact there is the rarey photic zone 150 meters down to 300 meters the term that scientists use to describe rare amounts  like rare fo take it our mission on the whole  this week's coverage  deep ocean live is to get to the bottom end  this zone to 300 meters the zone largely unexplored unlikely there are maybe thouss  mare creatures down there that have never really been seen before 3
1723,1.0,00 meters is the maximum that this submare can dive to we don't want to do that but they are designed  pressure tested with some safety factors  there so it's actually been tested beyond 300 meters okay well let's talk now to our science correspondent Thomas Moore who has dug deeper at a very different Isl  fonse  understs these zones  the importance  them to science Thomas that perhaps you get the biggest or the greatest biomass up  the shallows but down here you start to see the sort  diversity that might provide all sorts  answers to life on Earth yeah absolutely  I mean it the textbooks would say that the greatest biodiversity the greatest number  fish  mare species would be  the shallows  that sunlit zone but I thk the more people do explore the deeper ocean the more their understg that there is an awful lot  life down there perhaps more life than the reason the shallows  fact  that is the threat that commercial fisheries are now attracted to the mezzo photic layer where you are w
1724,1.0,here you get very rich fish numbers  those could be trawled  future before scientists have really been given a chance to underst what lives down there tens  thouss  mare species still need to be discovered down there  what you're seeg around you is quite exquisite you're seeg sea fans you're seeg sea whips are the forms  st corals  all around you it's snowg Anna that is mare snow that is comg down from the sunlit layer debris bits  food the other fish have left over  that is gonna fall all the way to the sea bottom but this much  it we snapped up by life below so it is quite an extraordary scene that you are witness to  if you went even deeper Thomas Trivedi perhaps he even beyond that to the abyss the difficulty for life down there is lack  oxygen very small amounts  oxygen no food as you say the stuff that's comg down will be gobbled up as it as it descends deeper no sunlight almost zero sunlight   course constant pressure this extreme pressure  low temperatures it's very difficult i
1725,1.0,sn't it for life to exist as we go deeper  deeper to the ocean  I said I lost you slightly there with the communications but I thk you're talkg about the importance  lights to the ocean  it drives everythg on the sunlight zone you've got lots  corals which form these reefs different corals will grow at different rates some can grow at 25 centimeters a year others perhaps just a few millimeters but down where you are although you can still get reefbuildg corals because there's so little light they tend to change their shape so you'll get the same kd  coral same species  coral but it takes on a much flatter shape  a table coral it's called just to try  maximize the amount  sunlight but the algae side that turned that light to energy  feed the coral polyps what are you seeg down there Anna what are we seeg down here we're seeg very small fish you'd thk perhaps they were more like small mare fish Thomas we're seeg a large number  sea fans some a little bit difficult to see  this image way 
1726,1.0, presentg to you now but we will move around very shortly we're seeg some with coral a lot  th les  they're famous because they can't retract their tentacles if you image that coral is a food for large numbers  animals most corals try to whip  their tentacles certaly to get out  the way  parrotfish famously are they bite through coral with a fused front teeth  that is  fact what gives us our beautiful sy beaches  some  this debris we've had drop down I mean this red submersible is completely covered  that mare snow isn't it so at that is probably washed away from the coral at all  drops down on us has been quite amazg actually there the submersible there it is it's here okay so we've got the Yellow Submare movg  now  you've got a grabber arm on that haven't you what to use that for to two purposes  this mission we're usg it to collect samples for the scientists so they identify certa species that are dicative  the area that we're explorg  we collect the samples  which they process  the
1727,1.0, lab later the other reason is for selfrescue okay  what way if we were to become entangled we can cut a le or free up another submersible or earlier  the mission we can attach a recovery le to equipment that might found a sequel has that ever happened to you yes not gettg entangled but recoverg well I'm glad I'm glad to hear that's not gonna happen to you certaly it's absolutely fascatg down here I have to say that when we started this journey the submersible tips down forward like that it's quite amazg so it tips down  then we drop to all it almost a hole  light  you look back  it's as if the surface is a mirror image it's like we should be jumpg to it  not the other way around  then what has surprised me is that you descend through balloon it's just you it's the open seas they describe it as the desert  the oceans I was expectg to see fish straight away but is this strange solitary feelg when you're droppg down did you get that still or not every time it is excitg yet once you leave
1728,1.0, the surface  even if there's waves  that action like you described  the different layers once you're underwater it's smooth  then you're just lookg for the bottom  you know as you get closer to that that sea floor that's when all the life stuff starts to come by  check you out yes  certaly we've had the little fish as soon as we led on what was a sy bottom we have the little fish dancg around us to the sea  then here because it's such a steep sided underwater mounta what did you do then well we had a lot  downdraft  a lot  updraft so we were kd  fdg different areas gettg out  out  the current   we came  here to this rock we found this this neat feature little cave  front  us  we're just kd  hunkered  there   I actually grabbed onto the rock to try to rema stable yes  that was partly that was partly wasn't it to try  save battery how much battery do you actually have we have quite a bit if we're maneuverg a lot  usg a lot  thrusters it could be reduced to two or three hours if we do a 
1729,1.0,lot  time explorg  just kd  driftg with the currents that are there we can stay down for about six hours  if somethg went wrong darrel ions if somethg went wrong we have a lot  methods to deal with that the emergency is to come to the surface but if we were to become stuck on the bottom  we have 96 hours  emergency life support four days four days  how would you be rescued somewhere like this 135 metres down well fortunately we have two other tools are on the mission we have ii submersible same def capabilities  another arm on that so they can come vestigate the entanglement they can hook up a recovery le they can try to have us the news  whatever we're  we also have two ROV which I believe can go up to 500 meters  it as well as a little grabber arm []   fact you can see the grabber arm on the front  the ROV certaly that allows it to get to a cage  so the little thg you can see at the bottom front  your screen that is the grabber arm  the the ROV  that gets to the cage that then is rai
1730,1.0,sed  the surface to get out  the way see looks like a syllabus  coral stuck to the top  it isn't it now where is that where's the other submersible goal I can't quite see it I don't feel mean how do you see them where are they terestg behd us that's all around see their lights anywhere no there might be just below us a little bit I have to say that we descend separately don't we  then we meet up below us no can't quite see them both no aga but it's very difficult sometimes  the gloomy lie to try  meet up isn't it it's quite difficult to to meet up under the water it is  fact today we descended together which makes a little easier stay together but we do have the trackg system on the ship so they have the ability to know what the position  each sub is  how to get us together it's worth potg out at this pot I guess that I am  fact the copilot that's true I can't fd the other submare that's probably our submersible rather which is one  the thgs I'm supposed to do isn't it if anythg happen
1731,1.0,s to you then I would have to take over yeah that's correct if I was to pass out for some reason it's actually very simple to brg the submare to the surface there's two valves you open up  the air will start to go to our ma ballast tanks  you're on the way to the surface  we use the the sub radio don'twe they would you know what you pretend called an underwater tahoe Jennifer yeah  you can talk to the surfaces through water columns it's a hydrophone  the surface ficer has that list  emergency procedures to talk with you as well okay  I would say pilot asleep put on is that a nice way to put it seems to be how you'll practice aga yeah leave I'm brgg the summary  he fell asleep copilot ready to ascend would you md if it was an emergency you'd once the xray xray xray okay  they would know to do somethg up there would they yeah they know to freeze all the mare traffic all  those they prepare for the sub to come to the surface  come up quickly what are the elements that you need to keep an 
1732,1.0,eye on when you're talkg to the surface safety ficer you've got depth pressure temperature all  these thgs why are they important  life it's important to give a consistent report as you can hear what the columns sometimes they go   out so havg that that study report  what depth are we what direction are we headg  our lifesupport systems still on  so we do those checks every 15 mutes tryg to see where they are can see some light where are they they're below us I thk underneath us let's look under our feet maybe they're under us no can't see you when I went to a left yeah they're still on our body below us  the importance  pressure obviously it's it's absolutely critical isn't it if you go a thous meters it's a hundred times the pressure 300 meters 30 times the pressure so if we accidentally got out  this right now what would happen to us well they're sold as he mentioned the pressure there's so much force on every little you know square centimeter  that hatch  fact if we were to undock 
1733,1.0,the hatch you couldn't even open it every one  us puttg your shoulder to it okay well that's amazg isn't it Emily  the other submersible is down believes us now a little bit earlier certaly we had a visitor we were movg up slightly  there was a potato grouper who decided to come  say hello [] [] [] they're nosy animals why do you thk they come  fd us you know we're aliens  their environment so they come  they check us out  I thk they're just curious when he followed us up for what 200 feets do you thk how much is that about 70 meters he decided to rise to the surface more yeah I saw him first down beneath the sudden anythg I came up  was explorg  gettg right up agast the spirit absolutely brilliant now we were talkg about pressure temperature  every the need to be you know as you said you could push this up well I do have all these dials behd you because you also have a digital display as well yeah the digital display controls some  the lights but it's mostly for convenience a navigati
1734,1.0,on for the pilot there's a lot  redundancy  the submersible so we do have analog gauges  a valve to be able to shut down any particular part  any  the systems so just from the top the green is the oxygen that's part  our life support  we are brgg pure oxygen to the cab at the same rate that we catalyze it to keep it at that normal level the black is the new ballast air that we use to distribute to the ballast systems that allows us to control our buoyancy underwater telephone you saw  then down the panel is the electrical  the only way to feel the true temperature  this is gettg really wet up here as many is to feel this  then you suddenly feel actually yeah it was quite cool cuz the rest  it feels really hot because it's such an enclosed environment yeah our acrylic sphere that we're  while it's great visibility it's a big sulator right so this this alumium patch we can feel directly with the water temperature I'm gonna draw yourself actually drips my rawater doesn't know that condens
1735,1.0,ation is good that means the lifesupport system is workg okay okay well I'll leave it up its do provide  you do constantly dry ourselves f you don't really want waster  here when we're gettg  at the surface you're very careful not to let water get  like yeah I can't affect the performance  the scrubber  obviously electronics don't like seawater  each  the submersibles have slightly different scientific tasks to perform don't know easy so what what is yours I mean that moment will knocked on see I'm not sure you can quite see it but we're locked on just beneath that shot by your brother on rakhi service yeah the Omega has been set up for this mission as what we're callg the samplg stuff so we with the arm we're collectg samples at the direction  the scientists we also have water collection system to sample water different depths as well as the CTD which is monitorg the conductivity temperature  depth throughout our dive  then the camera with the feed that you're seeg that's our HD camer
1736,1.0,a that allows us to actually film certa specimens  detail  I'm  the red sub here we've got Lucy  Robert  the yellow sub the different jobs as USA if we put our lights on even more committee that we let out her  everythg  then you can spot us  is that helpful when you get even deeper  an even darker yeah you know we navigate with the lights f a lot  the time because  the deep blues it's easier to see distance but once we get close to somethg we'll put on a lot  light  that brgs the color back to what we're seeg it makes it easier to identify the species  different thgs that were lookg at fantastic well  all  those elements as we mentioned earlier are taken up to the surface where there are all sorts  scientists at work right now Mark Aust is there  thank you very much Anna we take so much  this for granted don't we communications  on loud with GPS  satellites but  course all  that doesn't really work underwater so it's worth explag perhaps how we are how we are dog this  it is that we'v
1737,1.0,e got the two subs below us now at 120 hundred  thirty meters below the ship  at that level you know salt  pressure  the lack  electromagnetic waves means that that the traditional TV signal does not get through so a receiver has been lowered to between the subs  a where we are  fact so the subs then use LED lights LED lights are transmittg the beams up to the receiver audio  visual signals  then it's transferred by cable to the ship where we are  from here our satellite be a normal traditional television communication means satellite gets the picture to you well I'm joed by Oliver steed who's the head  the mission thanks very much for jog us I mean this seeg pictures like this live pictures like this has been a bit  a mission  yours  a dream  yours it has it's been a true you  I thk that's because there's two stories  the world about the ocean one is a negative one  we know what's happeng to our ocean we're sleepwalkg to a disaster at the moment  there's the other side which is just h
1738,1.0,ow wonderful our ocean is you know this is the blue planet  the beatg heart  our planet is our ocean  we need people to fall  love with it we need to spire people  it  I hope pictures like this can do that because if we can do that if people can fall  love with the ocean there's a hope that want to look after it  if they would look after a baby the politicians will be given a mate to act  act a lot faster than they need then they are at the moment yeah look we could have done this anyway why dabra i mean obviously it's a very special place but why out there  why why now so algebra is the Galapagus  the Indian Ocean but there's first there's been no research believe 30 meters here so we need to underst how the ocean is changg particularly Indian Ocean which is the least explored  one  the most one  the most unprotected oceans on the planet so what we're here to do is to try  gather that action that actionable data undertake a series  first descents  use that data to help form the Seyche

1745,1.0,y we can privileged to see a number  shots on our Burien side [] on the mothership you're very lucky to have seen that shark it's impossible to tell from this distance what it was but I can tell you that there are an awful lot down there with you it's a sign  a healthy reef sharks are what are known as apex predators are not the only ones down there there are groupers too that are big consumers  smaller fish on the reef why are the same many well because this is at the middle  a really strictly enforced mare protected area what you're seeg there is evidence that it works that these fish are given a chance to grow to an enormous size that there are plenty that there is plenty  food for them to eat  that's why the epic striated Predators will thrive it is a lesson to other areas  the world that mare protection can lead to quite extraordary mare life  that's the benefit for them  deed for us as we watch these pictures Thomas they're said to be about 19 species  shark [] especially [] spec
1746,1.0,ies [] to [] [] []  is now beneath us once aga as we just we can see [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] never just to remd you this we have a team who've been the deepest ever  this part  the world that if you are a scuba diver  go to 30 meters around here perhaps only 20 meters because it is so [] yeah [] I'm 35 [] there's a lot  caves here  a lot  places [] [] [] [] []  sponges it's a bit like corals as well they are animals  certaly looks like [] [] 500 million years ago today [] our sponge [] this mission very confident [] see to check image [] we move along [] [] [] [] [] [] [] well there are wardens who are based on algebra over there one  them who is now joed the nekton mission [] [] [] there's a bit about those waters that we're lookg at right now she is from the Seychelles  she was actually the first Seychellois to take a dive like Ana bottg has now taken what do you make  what you're seeg just unbelievable because for someone who's been here for two years you will never actually i
1747,1.0,mage that this place is like deep down there is like so beautiful so much environment that you didn't expect it to be like back down there  the deep ocean is like so beautiful so amazg yeah it's unbelievable how many yeah  how I mean you went down the other day what was it like beg the first person from the Seychelles to descend to the depths like this it was just amazg the feelg was it was mixed feelgs it was just for the first time to ever be able to go down from like a scuba lower than that the scuba ft was like just breathtakg beautiful  it's just credible to see such thgs it was so calm so like you see fish is like just amazg yeah now you spent two years on dabra very briefly just sum up what that isl means to you just very quickly someone  came a home for two years it became a place that every day you woke up you wake you see the same place but it just it was somethg always do somethg new you always experience a new thg every day was not it was the same they are the new day yes b
1748,1.0,ut there was always somethg new happen if there was always that you go divg you always see somethg different even if you are gog the same spot but yeah it's just been a lovely place place that is close to my heart all right well Stephanie thanks very much you've just got a few mutes left  this extraordary hour so let's go back down to Ana somewhere down  the deep mark thanks very much deed down  the deep but lookg up actually  a shark that is still been circlg I don't know if the ROV can see those pictures it's quite murky for us to see we can't identify what type it is but fantastic to see the shark above us vestigatg  if we look above our head there all these ty fish that are just watchg us from above it's absolutely wonderful to   front  us  course the Yellow Submare with the Robert  with Lucy who are still vestigatg all the nooks  the crannies as we have been wonderful to try  hear side after all the creatures that might be livg there who knows some  them may never have been seen  
1749,1.0,already we know that carl's are used  cancer care like prostagl  so there's still so much to vestigate that may be used for Humanity that's why they need to be vestigated that's why the scientists reelectg mission are on this ship tryg to look more deeply at what is under what is  the deep ocean  what they can see I'm gog to show you the yellow submare aga there it is the lights agast the wall you can see how steep it is that it rises from the deep that the thermal currents that will farmer pliers that whip around these areas that's the difference is there between temperature  the ocean layer  the different layers [] we're float you don't even need the thrusters on the currents are good we're just about stutterg thank you so much for watchg us here thank you so much to Ry for takg us through  your world it's an extraordary place to be I have to say that's pretty much all we have time for tomorrow hopefully mark will be down perhaps gog deeper will assess perhaps the plastics that we se
1750,1.0,e here  also on the isl  dabra plenty more from us down  the deep on deep ocean live thanks for watchg [] [] [] [] yes welcome to the Indian Ocean where we have just stopped where we witnessed a broadcastg first because about a couple hundred metres below me has been my colleague Anna bossg for the last hour I hope you've been watchg our the first ever live television broadcast from under the ocean  those are the pictures that we've been lookg at this is a live picture now  we've been lookg at some wonderful pictures  I hope that Anna body now aware that she's got to come up because they've been down for some time now but I hope that Anna can hear me because I want to ask her  be the first to ask her what that experience was like Anna I hope you can hear me still well it is entirely about broadly mark that's the only way I can describe it we just turned our air conditiong f so you can hear it better so we'll start to probably fill back  here quite quickly   fact this starts drippg ra o
1751,1.0,n us as such as the condensation  this small perspex fear that we're  it is entirely otherworldly if I just changed my camera you can see what it looks like that is the other sub as submersible the yellow submersible with the prcipal scientist  it Lucy would rule  the pilot Robert Carmichael we've also been down here a little bit deeper epic now aren't we 88 88 feet down such about 10 Connor was skg slightly  moments we can get a little bit Neeraj  the the yellow submersible as we see  we can see them  there perhaps they can wave to us no they're lookg because we have just identified some cold that we've not seen certaly down here there Lucy's lookg around just wonderful but it really is otherworldly that's the only way to describe it first  all we've had a shark circlg around us for most  the program when you look up it's a beautiful blue color but when you look below it is a murky it's not blue it's not deep blue as I was expectg it to be but certaly here because the legality  dabra 
1752,1.0,flushes out there is a lot  sediment that falls or perhaps that's why you get a sense  it beg a brown  other world is we can't show what it looks like down that's partly because we're right by this rock face I have to say it doesn't give us quite so much maneuverability  this really shows the geography  this call at all right  the middle  the Indian Ocean it is previous mounta is called a seam up now what would have happened is that the mounta itself would have begun to fall on descend  to drop leavg behd the coal that it made its home  certaly what they were expectg to see here is coral at different levels  depth  previous uncleanness ice ages were then a flooded post ice ages would have flooded  the sea levels would have risen  we're a little bit further out I thk that the mirror is currently flat now yes so we're seeg the old world mountas to the ancient the ancient mounta side here  the colors that have made this place their home the small fish  are you surprised gri by how many fi
1753,1.0,sh you see at a depth like this you know not I'm not super surprised what what trigues me is that a lot  these you expect to see  a shallow reef then we go deeper  they're down here it's amazg what life is where we've never been  done  these are extraordary aren't they look at these beautiful the light  our camera pickg out just beautiful yellow  presumg it's a Karl I don't know we've seen sponges as well haven't we  what is important to remember is that these are livg animals  need to look like the other like their clothes these are livg creatures that are probably on this rock face  order to catch the plankton  is swirlg around the ocean  is brought up from the as we move along with different colors  the from the the white light  the beach almost that has come down as Mare snow absolutely beautiful see these thgs that we've never seen before [] []  just above us all the fish the different sized fish that come to see us  swimmg  front the swimmg above [] what we're gog to do now isn't
1754,1.0, gonna have to start ascendg we've nearly got to the end  our battery life have who do you thk we need the power to take us to the surface what will happen is that you will eventually lose communications with us I don't know if the remote camera can see the lights above us I can't quite see it now that is a depressor connected to the ship  we are beg a light to that  that's how we are managg to communicators have to come really quite close to us today to try  see if we could get communication with the other submersible that will have to be pulled out  the way  as soon as that is Darw then you will lose communications with us but the remotely operated vehicle over there the remote camera which has been piloted from the ship's surface well hopefully follow us are all the way to the surface we currently that is 78 137 meters so you are hopefully follow us up as far as you can from a hundred  thirty seven meters down all the way to the surface  we'll see you then part two leave a mark see 
1755,1.0,you shortly [] [] we'll hopefully see before this hour is out back on the surface I mean it has been quite a spectacle beg able to see Anna so clearly Thomas for our science correspondent here see her so clearly  here I'm not quite so clearly but at least we did we did here what did you I mean did you thk that would be what we saw I mean did you thk we could do it first  all it was a challenge defitely I thk the currents around here have been extremely unpredictable as they are around many  these enormous underwater mountas around a hundred thous  those dotted around the world but only a few dozen have been explored  we are the first to explore the seamount here  algebra but they do whisk these currents around because all that deep water is pushed up the side  the mounta it can cause an unpredictable current  also cause there was this enormous Lagoon  the center  here big enough to swallow up Manhattan you're quite comfortably all that water nearly all  that water will come out at low 
1756,1.0,time spread around the isl that too makes the extremely challengg tensity yeah I should just expla to viewers where we are we're on a a supply ship  fshore supply ship  we're just about what four or five hundred meters f the f the isl it's actually on this side you can see it  tantalisg because not many people can go there you did you manage to stay the night there with the local Rangers who are workg on the isl just a few  them but he said it's a it's a an isl that's been protected from man by man hasn't it yeah absolutely emphatic so station run by Seychelles Isls foundation they have a team there who safeguard the wildlife there it is somethg which is where nature is is  charge not not humans although sadly you do see the effect  humans here  terms  climate change so you will see some bleachg  the coral here when the coral spits out the algae that it has side which it depends on for energy but what's remarkable  this is what I found yesterday there is some research on the isl which 
1757,1.0,shows that the coral here recovers much more quickly from these episodes  rather than dyg which were happeng sadly elsewhere  the Seychelles it seems to be much more robust  that if they thk he is possibly because we are surrounded by this mare protected area there is no commercial fishg so there are plenty  herbivorous fish chompg away at the algae that would otherwise swallow up the reef that is crucial for what we see here  terms  fish life  the cold absolutely  what we can't see from pictures that is dabra but beyond that sort  reef there's because it's the second largest coral reef coral atoll  the world beyond that is this massive Lagoon what 16 miles by 5 miles or somethg which is the very central life  that at all  the water rushes through the let on the toll free with it all sorts  wonderful mare life yeah that's right an awful lot  sediment  sediment equals nutrients  where you've got nutrients you will fd an awful lot  life startg from the very small   course attractg the ve
1758,1.0,ry big  this area does have a phenomenal number  apex predators these are animals which are the top  the food cha so thkg  sharks you thk your groupers  they're much larger than they would be elsewhere   much greater numbers just because the waters here are so rich let's just expla what we're seeg I mean these are pictures taken now from our remotely operated camera beg operated from just across the ship across the deck here  we are watchg the submare submersibles ascendg comg back   surely hopefully they will be back on the surface  Anna will be back with us but that that camera you can see just the front  it that camera is is what we're relyg on at the moment for these pictures yes deed now that is the the claw that remote operated submersible users  course to take submersibles  so on they were seen  the foreground there but that is one  these submersibles risg to the surface they do like to take their time they don't like to rush it they couldn't  an emergency come up   ten meters f
1759,1.0,rom great depth to ten mutes rather but they do for the comfort  everybody on board like to come up a little more slowly yeah now had we time durg the previous out we were gog to talk a little bit about what you've seen over the last well three weeks you've been on this boat just tell us a little about a little bit about what you've seen I  hammerhead sharks yes Andres I had all thumps which was the first isl group that I visited  I went down  one  the submersibles two to 200 meters  yes I did see an awful lot  life there I saw corals  course but also a hammerhead shark  I barely had time to get my my camera out before this hammerhead was right on me is somethg that I've always wanted to see this extraordary sharks with that great classic shape  the hammer at the front  it's got eyes on the end  it also seems to have methods  detectg the Rays buried  the s there  his head too  it gives it the almost stereoscopic ability to ppot the Ray  snaffle a while it's there they're very clever th
1760,1.0,ey can apparently detect the heartbeat fish hidg  the s yeah I see the right  then sharks do have this disability with their with the lateral les  also sensors  their  their heads do that they're able to almost have that sixth sense they've got very good vision good hearg to the spell  course as we know  also this ability google raise useful eagle rays  beautiful beautiful creatures a metre  a half across   course it's their their fs which have become extended  developed to wgs almost  they they fly almost like birds formation under the water  they   attract other fish to them hopg to pick f the scraps as they feed on some fish now I've never seen a sunfish yeah pretty big from a picture size yeah savvy I wasn't the one to see this you'll be talkg to the scientists shortly who did for the sunfish who did see that was blown away because it is so rare to see these thgs particularly under the water you do see them poppg around on the surface with their very high dorsal fs they're sometime
1761,1.0,s mistaken for sharks but it was quite an amazg thg just just to be swimmg very slowly past the submersible really enterg there well  before we just came out here everybody was talkg about the coelacanth I went to a laboratory  Oxford where they were talkg about the coelacanth which was a well as a livg fossil  a fish tell us about the silica so the coelacanth was thought to be extct they thought it died out sixtyeight million years ago but last century a few hundred miles to the South here down the South Africa the Mozambique  fishermen pulled up a coelacanth  its  its net  they immediately thought that this was a hoax that it could not possibly be true  yet we have Do fish that livg fossil now possibly  these waters the kd  environment we have here  algebra is very like the environment where we have now seen livg examples  the coelacanth this is such a strange fish it is the only one to have a three lobes tail it is the only one to have the begngs  legs terrestrial animal legs  its f
1762,1.0,s  the begngs perhaps  lungs  it's such an unusual fish we don't really underst where it lives we don't underst where it fits  to the family tree  life but it's there I mean is there a chance  them fdg new species do you thk most  on this trip almost undoubtedly mark the more you explore the deep the more you fd is probable that there are tens  thouss  mare species yet to be discovered these are unexplored waters  as you go deeper you will fd more you'll fd corals you'll fd fish your fee you'll fd other species too  really just the work dog here on the nekton ship is begng to catalogue that life for the Seychelles government you  just there fally on this now you may put a baited camera down a common thg to do it's a great great way  seeg mare life undisturbed by humans safer if a submersible or deed with scuba diver goes down there with a camera you're  course gog to get the teraction between that human beg  whatever they're sayg but if you put a baited camera down there you are drawg 
1763,1.0, mare life they build they smell they're the churned fish guts  the  there  the bait  it will come   you can capture that on camera we've seen sharks we've seen groupers it is quite an extraordary sight yeah  the pictures we're seeg now from under but  the depth are as I was sayg from the remote control it looks as though the submares oh no that one  the submares is still there submersibles is soon you can just see how steep that wall is mark that's the the underwater mounta we've been talkg about that rises four or five thous meters from the floor  the Indian Ocean extremely steeply  we don't really know what's gog on under the water because the last time this was plumbed with with lead weights  rope was 1800s  really we're only now begng to underst as we put out survey ships with proper sonar equipment look you'll get a much better idea  the shape  the seafloor around here  algebra yeah okay wonderful pictures there  thanks Thomas for the time beg  there's the mothership waitg now fo
1764,1.0,r the return welcome an apostle really wishg for the turn return  the submersible that brought you those wonderful pictures for the for the last hour  what you can see there is very terestg this is the depressor Nick always a receiver really  this is the bit  equipment that got you those pictures this is the bit  equipment that the the LED lights from the submersibles has to hit so that the receiver or depressor they call it can then relay the pictures by cable to this ship where we are  that is good news because that means that's the safe return  the  the receiver  that means we can use it aga tomorrow for deep ocean live  with me now is Rihanna Walton who is one  the scientists on on this trip Ravana thanks very much for jog us I should ask you first I suppose would it be made  the past hour or so watchg this have you seen it all before well I mean I've never seen up Deborah that deep so it's been credible I know a diver I know the shallow reefs I know down to 30 meters but I've neve
1765,1.0,r seen anythg that deep here so it's been credible experience to witness it you know live on TV seeg them descendg  seeg the changes  the reef is it gets much deeper so let's be clear it's a first broadcastg from that death but scientists won't have been at that depth  this area exactly so that because they asked on its own remote it's so far from anywhere it's very difficult to do any research here particularly underwater so this really this hole at all is relatively unexplored it's only the shallow reefs that we've began to underst  recent years but even much deeper we still don't know much about it  coral is your area  expertise you mean  the Seychelles for sometimes I know what is your view about the state  the coral at the moment so the state  the coral out Deborah is it's much better than it is  other areas  Seychelles so unfortunately we suffered a global bleachg event  2016  the the reefs  Seychelles workg quite hard  Irel suffered a large high mortality   coral but how Deborah
1766,1.0, did much more resilient so the corals here to show they're recoverg already  they weren't  they didn't suffer a high percentage  mortality like other areas  Seychelles right  do you thk what we fd or what you guys fe here will be a positive story because there are so many stories  coral beg impacted around the world how do you thk it'll be a positive story I hope that it will yeah  course I thk we've already seen positive stories around ever  the past  I thk it it kdly be a positive thg that were actually you gog to explore  underst the deep air is about ever now  that's always good for research  the question I asked Thomas little earlier why here why what is so special about this ecosystem so our demo is very special because it is so remote it's suffered far less time to purge any impacts that anywhere else  this region so there is fewer effects  pollution  human volvement so for that reason it's remaed a lot more resilient it also has a thrivg terrestrial ecosystem which also has wh
1767,1.0,ich researchers found that both  those ecosystems together thrive a better underwater coral reef system as well okay  just fally just expla to us so you will go down you'll get some  the coral  what will you do with those samples how will it help you underst what is happeng here yeah so  the shallows were collectg some samples  st corals  hard corals  also even down to the depths we've collected samples  st corals  that has to get a bit  a catalogue  the diversity so we're lookg for those common species so we can understg  the the composition  species prompt sort  five meters all the way down to 200 bottg very close up  her submersible lookg very happy  why not because that is a wonderful wonderful experience that she has just gone through  let's have a look ready very well acquated with is my pilot for this mission Ry holt thank you so much for havg us what an extraordary workg environment you have it's amazg down here you know every dive is different  we get to go places where people
1768,1.0, have never been before expla where we are gog to change the cameras which I can do we've tucked herself to a crevice isn't 135 meters yeah we're kd  leang agast the edge  a cliff an underwater cliff we were fightg some down drafts  some up drafts  we got to this position so we just kd  parked ourselves on a Ledge  are tryg to stay stationary  I should give you a proper title  course you are an Aquanaut if an astronaut explores space you explore the deep yes you know where an ner space it's a whole new place down here  you know it's a 3d environment so we're always movg around we're gonna know where we are how how we're movg through the water column are we lighter are we duck the heavier all that that's exactly it's it's it's amazg to watch should with all the controls  as you said you're flyg these submersibles you're not drivg them  as you said the oceans make up 97%  the habitable space on planet Earth which gives you both a sense  the depth  the oceans but also that 3d environment 
1769,1.0,that we have joed an expedition led by the scientist  the natural mission their aim is to perform a deep ocean health check  map  chart to sample to see perhaps what no one has ever seen before  even search for those rarely seen species literally  the shadows the dream perhaps  a sixgill shark or even a Celia camp the Do fish thought to be extct for millions  years  crucially to see what is happeng to that ten colourful coral as it faces unprecedented threats it is so important as habitat  home to millions  species the big question for the scientists is could the deeper ocean be a refuge from the dangers  climate change  even from a plastic pollution that we have talked so much about at sky well we are not alone down here this is someone the red one although it's been showered by this downdraft  sediment which you will hear the team refer to you as Omega out there we can see them is sub to the yellow the yellow ah yes the yellow one well we have the red what I've already done at which 
1770,1.0,they called Kensgton should we see if we can raise them actually because  there is the prcipal scientist on this amazg expedition dr. Lucy Woodall from the nectar mission  pilotg her sub is Robert Carmichael let's see if we can raise them on the ship on the air sir yeah underwater telephone Kensgton Kensgton Omega come back I'm gonna pass the f day Anna to terview Lucy talkg about [] [] try aga try aga hello Lucy can you hear me hello Lucy can you hear us I was just askg you about the reasons you're tryg to explore the deep [] Thank You Lucy that's all I've tried  talk to you a little bit later thank you well let's go straight to these pictures we can see now from the from the remote camera  it is  the one  the submersibles  we are expectg them back any moment now so extraordary rollg gog on with submerse wasn't a submersibles good roll but they they certaly can  I'm joed actually by Pressor Louise lcock who is with the science mission here  there's a thg or two about this what do you 
1771,1.0,make  these pictures I thk you'll probably fd it's the remotely operated vehicle that's rollg I've never seen this up roll but what do you make  the picture what we see  this morng I mean I I thk it's fantastic really we're  somewhere we've never been before nobody's ever been here we're lookg at a you know a fantastic new environment our job is now just to try  work out exactly what it is down there do a little bit  systematics check the species  coral so that we can catalog it all probably so we've got a lot  work to do later yes so you will be gog down  these submersibles or your members will  this is the way that you can pick up samples that's right one  the subs is equipped with them a stereo camera system so that we get really good video  we've got cameras  various places actually they're potg downwards potg forwards  we've got a set on the side as well  case were  strong currents  we have to sort  power along a wall  so we've got one sub totally equipped for the camera work  the
1772,1.0, other sub is equipped with the bio box on the front  the collectg arm  we have a permit to collect five specimen to the earth at each depth that we're workg yes I thk that that is Anna's son when I can we can see her they're preparg to make return to the to the surface which probably very pleased about she's had a wonderful trip I mean it is for someone like  they're gog down like this for the first time it is just the most trigug sort  other world I thk it's an amazg feelg I mean I've been  plans for almost 30 years  I had my first submersible time wagon fonzo  it was just credible that the sort  feelg  calm sittg  we were sittg on the bottom at 200 meters  then we just turned the lights out  all the fish came when it was just amazg I mean the serene scientists I just found it the best thg ever yes  you can't rush the ascent it's a fairly slow process isn't it I thk everythg is everythg is slow you know they don't go particularly fast the subs we don't need them to go fast because if
1773,1.0, we want good camera pictures we need a very slow transit so so they work perfectly for what we're we're tryg to get out  them yes well we expect her back  just a few moments say a pressor or coach just tell what is your role  all this so I came on board actually to brg a bit more experience with them camera systems  deep water operations so I mostly work with the deep water ROV f the coast  Irel I've got fundg from  Foundation Irel to vestigate the corals that occur  our deep waters we get corals down to about two  a half thous metres which is absolutely fantastic we work with camera systems you know these are complicated bits  care tryg to get transit thouss  them  fast currents a difficult thg to do  any somethg that I have a certa amount  experience   so I came on board to try  get get all this workg really  I thk we have you know we've developed protocols now that we're runng with the subs  very fast currents  we're gettg back the imagery that we need for analysis we've talked abo
1774,1.0,ut it a lot but this place is especially rich obviously as  a rich ecosystem do you thk there will be new species species that scientists have found I thk it's almost certaly the case I mean some coral species have a global distribution  they put out you know larvae  these travel around the world  global kerat  there are some coral species that are really found all over the world  then there are other coral species that have very distctive distributions ten they even  the same ocean delimited by death so here 100 meters I get a different species  coral looks quite similar but it's this thg so the chances  us fdg new coral species here I would've 00 percent dabra so remote somethg here so quite a proportion  what's here Summer Sun will be global species but  some will be Indian Ocean specific species but but someone we knew okay well what we can see is at the bottom  that submersible  she is on the way to the surface so as a communication the receiver that we were usg to communicate is 
1775,1.0,out  the water now so we can't communicate with you just see her  the what you can see  the foreground is the front  the remotely controlled camera  that is what is producg these pictures at the moment  she's about two mutes away from surfacg here  debaran so we hear a lot pressor about you know bleachg events  the warm waters impactg on the coral any sign so far about so I haven't lived on the surface Coral Sea there's a dive team gog out this afternoon to look at surface coral so really I look so far has been  the deep water corals  we won't expect to see such an impact here there's a thermic le here at about 70 80 meters just expla what a thermic le is so thermic le is where the temperature changes really suddenly so down to about 70 80 meters the temperatures around 28 30 degrees below there it drops steeply to them eight degrees  so  that cold water bleachg is not gog to be the same issue also once you get deep enough  course these corals they're  really deep water don't have the 
1776,1.0,symbiotic algae that the shallow water corals have so there is some light at the depths we've been that today  fact the waters very clear  there's a reasonable amount  light but as you get down to 250 300 even 500 meters where we're gog there's less light  there different sorts  corals that wouldn't suffer completely the same way [] but you've been  these submersibles what's it live  it is a very conservative very ty other they are small there they are built for function non comfort should we say yes they can get extremely humid  there  fact one  my jobs that was to empty all the walls  the condensation from the air conditiong but even there that the ignition doesn't really work very well because they'd like to preserve the the battery life these this sub pilots so they they have it warm you get extremely dehydrated you can't stretch your legs  that's somethg that animal really notice even though she's apparently they're about fifty feet from the surface now yep so they will see a mark
1777,1.0,ed crease  the tensity  light now they'll be able to see the Sun pourg through the surface layer perhaps they'll be ventg an awful lot  air from the the submersible itself  as they rise they may be gog at the same speed  the bubble which is a very strange feelg that you are servicg that rapidly  then that dome will break the surface  there they will see  that picture really wonderful pictures aren't they to see the submersible addressed like that is quite extraordary  you can see the power  the Sun  it is that Sun that drives the mare ecosystem the more tense the light the greater the chance  course the coral makg energy  growg there says apparel for coral to that the combation light tensity  warm water can spell coral bleachg  there we are there is an abortion  her submersible  well done to the pilot Ry  I'm sure he's now communicatg with the little rib boat they've got f this ship which will go out  pick up Anna after what has been I mean I have to say just an amazg experience I'm su
1778,1.0,re for her she was very excited this morng certaly when she knew that this was gog to happen because  course there are lots  thgs that can stop these thgs happeng  have stopped these thgs happeng for sure  there this the wave conditions  course have been quite benign here but the currents have been the challenge really wherever we have been  the Seychelles  we are divg next to these enormous sea bounds they get very unpredictable very strong currents  partly because nobody has mapped the seafloor here  a hundred years so we have on board a team that is dog exactly that usg much more uptodate equipment back  the 1800's they were throwg ropes over with net weights at the end tryg to gauge the depth but now they're usg sonar  it is much more accurate  produces quite exquisite colorful maps very detailed maps  that will defitely be a legacy  this mission well there's detailed notes  there that are not washg is just puttg away she'll need those aga drk  water earlier  she will have deserved
1779,1.0, every bit  that but I have to say that this is worth still watchg because the very difficult maneuver about to happen which is our presenter gettg out  that thg  onto a rib which could be well they were typically the most entertag move  the entire last hour or so but  it's a serious pot so that are the rib has to go out yes the pilot will stay  the submersible controllg submersible  then how what they do is they pick up  I take out a back the pilot will eventually get out  then the submersible will be lifted crane lifted out  the water is that right it is deed so Anna the first thg will happen is that the hatch there will will open when the support diver is a sports swimmer is there on board he'll clamber on the back  a sub you can see the Front's are begng to submerged slightly below the surface but he'll clamber on on board he'll open up the hatch then Anna needs to stretch those legs that have been crumpled up for the last few hours st on her seed st on another console  then clambe
1780,1.0,r up through that hatch  try not to lose her Bauman's mark as the waves gently rocked their submersible  then  course she will make her way down to the rib that you see there as they're gog f the back  our mothership liftg f the crane that took back that ship down that boat down yeah mate around watch how she does this because I've got to do it tomorrow because it's my turn down there tomorrow  I have to say it is a very excitg prospect which was a plastic plastic tomorrow the question impact  plastic tomorrow  Anna will be on one  these extraordary beaches where even here I mean even here one  the most accessible sanctuaries accessible isls  Indian Ocean very difficult to even hear plastic tons  it I'm told is washg up you've been there yes I'm so gettg plastic  I saw wildlife beg trapped  consumg it  that's the the peril for there we can hear the the crane just firg up driver gog to his cab  that is the the crane that will be liftg Anna's submersible out  the water thankfully not whi
1781,1.0,le she's still on board there you can see the the rescue swimmer they're just dryg f the the top  the the hatch because if you open that with the water still there all that would pour to the cab  the most sensitive electronics that have kept Hannah  Ry alive I have to say I never thought that  the bottg exitg a submersible would ever be alive television event but my suspicion well it's somethg isn't it what she's just done well you can see Ry side also dog the same to the rag tryg to dry it f so that she can make a slightly drier exit that she would have done otherwise yeah  my answer had Marcus yeah the longer they wait  there the hotter that's gettg because there  the other submersed will be comg up soon   they've effectively been down there yes how does the survey surveyg they have what they call stereoscopy but it's gog to be the transfer from the submersible to the rib the little flatable that comes along son hold on Anna please they ru this now that's quite rough isn't it so the 
1782,1.0,flatable will come   you should see that any moment so here it is  now this this little sort  well I said how would you describe as a little shop but across or a boat  that so we're gog to stay together  not be separated by the Indian  the nations well you see the driver  the boat they're strugglg to get the right position yeah is strugglg over this a little bit so what do they do if just tossed out the magnet she's not he's got a little bit there Mare grabs the boat tenable at the TV sideshow this moment [] whew she's done it give us a wave  I forget to say no idea she's on live television but there we are so she is away she'll be brought back now to the ship  the pilot pilot will also exit exit now but these submersibles used as we saw durg that previous hour for a very serious pot they have these robotic arms they take the samples you put the samples  the submersibles  brg them up here for the scientists that we be talkg to to start with you yes because they're lookg for new species
1783,1.0,  the only way  dog that has been to the surface where they can actually do some analysis they can catalog those species  coral for the miature  the Seychelles but also they have lots  cameras onboard their submersibles at some pot afford somethg down they have what they call stereoscopic cameras as I was about to tell you before  those are 3d cameras where they can try  underst the structure  the rebreather  the complexity  that reef there's an awful lot  science that he's done as these subs travel on mother called transects marked distances along the reef where they will be countg life  also that the different species  life  that really is the kd  work that they'll be dog now  there you can see that they're begng to prepare the submersible for it to be lifted out by the crane Ry the pilot is still on board you can see him turng on his thrusters there at the back tryg to brg the submersible with range  the crane  there you see emergg there the the bottom the hook that Shane will then 
1784,1.0,clipons those the ropes that he's holdg there above the glass dome  the submersible   your top left is on their way back  I can't work out Ry is gog to go on the that rib as well Thomas just for now thanks very much let's brg  our next guest talkg there with Thomas about mappg  surveyg the deep  that's what you specialized  that's what you do isn't it so yeah that's what we've been dog on on this FRC we've been hold on hold on if I see what it's done for fast rescue craft so it's normally used for my overboard situations but we've fitted out with all our server equipment so when we get to a location we go out first we survey the areas as Thomas just said before a lot these areas so it's a big it's really a bigger version  the flatable that we're seeg yeah exactly exactly that it's just a version  that  we're gog out  fdg a good area  a safe area for the substitue down yeah  your Ana mappg the the how deep the knew about some  the system we've got here that we've Teledyne mare  given to
1785,1.0, us we've we compact down to about 600 700 meters so we're gog from about about 600 meters all the way to about  or 5 meters so they're gog basically as far fshore as we can get obviously the subs  can only go to 300 meters  the rav goes down to 500 so you can see it all on computer here comes her Ry who was down there with there  with an opposg very experienced two submersible pilot 10 years an American guy who's leaner  actually put this submersible together for this trip he takes it apart  then rebuilds it so he certaly knows what he's highlightg  certaly knows about what he's dog  now the rig will brg Anna who has hard hat battle back on brgg out  Ry background to the ship  hopefully we'll be able to to see them reasonably soon yes are gog back to actually now there is the submersible no that is beg lifted [] back onto me behd us there extraordary mr. Kephart is a very fantastic have you been there anyone I haven't I've been out every day surveyg yes hopefully get a chance to or at
1786,1.0, the end well look as we watch these pictures  the submersible comg back we were just sayg so you have a computer all yes so you can watch what you're yes oh we see the 3d map  the seabed beg generated  real time as we're gog along that all generates on the computer  then once were fished we come back on board  we show that to the sub pilots  the ROV pilots  then from that forms where they're gog to do their dives obviously the areas are lookg for these thgs steep walls  they've been on today so yeah we were out yesterday surveyg that fd out where it is so we can get the ship  the right position  fd some good areas to their science I hope they treat this submersible carefully because that's that's what I'm gettg to honey this tomorrow so they don't come back thg down but they've got pretty good at it by now they have got pretty good at it by now yeah I'm sure okay well Mike thanks very much deed thanks very much  Thomas is back with us Thomas they'll be here a lot longer than we will h
1787,1.0,ow long do these missions last  you know what will they do with the formation they get well they're away for about seven weeks they'll be gog on from algebra to other isls outer isls here at Seychelles aga more sea mounts on these underwater mountas  they're tryg to underst they're tryg to produce a catalogue  life which is so important the Seychelles government has been ahead  the curve on mare protection that they really get it they have already protected 15%  their vast ocean territory that's the size  the   they're gog to protect another 15% so doublg it by 2020 but what they need to know is what do you protect what is so special what is so rare here  dabra to make sure that it is not destroyed by human activity from further afield whether that be climate change or pollution plastic pollution were deed overfishg these are the issues that can affect these waters  that is why they're desperate to protect the life with two big coral events fairly recently was  2000 1998 9:30  the 2009
1788,1.0, 2  3 2016 as well  what impact with those beg each bleachg event data called on there boy impact would they have had here  would the call  beg able to resist that here so they did affect coral here but terestgly the the coral here  algebra seems to have been more robust although an awful lot  it did bleach that's when it spits out is algae because it can't tolerate the hot water  it just shuts down  effect a bit like when we have a fever we don't feel like eatg well the same is true  the coral too so it spits out his food source the algae but what happened elsewhere  the Seychelles is that the warm water persisted  the coral died but here because it's  a mare protected area because there are many more fish feedg all the algae that would otherwise have smothered the reef that coral had a much better chance  recovery so it really has bounced back  that is why you see such abundant mare life here  is this general warmg will localized warmg or both that's a really good question it is gene
1789,1.0,ral so every year  the summer  course you would get spikes  temperature here  the water but what is happeng now is that the background you like with climate change is creasg so it's comg from a lower trough  the peaks are gettg higher each summer  it's that summer peak which is gettg a much higher  at the time  much longer  that's what's causg the coal much more problem many more problems  particularly  an El No year that's that current  the South Africa South American which doubles up with climate change she'll be back on board which will be very good news after well quite a broadcastg experience for  well for everyone quite a broadcastg experience when they work we'll have seen that live for a while I have to say I was a bit  a skeptic I thought well they'll be cuttg back to us because the thg it was there wasn't it  we saw those pictures   Anna did remarkably well   there is oliver steeds all  us t2 is the head  the mission  he will welcome Anna back to the to the ship   I have to s
1790,1.0,ay I was talkg to her over breakfast this morng is she well she was sayg last night that she wasn't nervous  then this morng she admitted that it was all gettg a bit tense  then we she was about to get  the submare there was a storm  the distance  all those thgs go through one's md  there's a broadcaster you know you don't do these thgs very ten than they are they're exceptionally terestg  we're exceptionally privileged to do this but they are not challengg nevertheless  not somethg everybody would want to do let's be honest about it  but she's back   we're very happy about this I'm stg now with Paris Stefan artists who is one  the scientists at Paris the reasons I've just got you  here is because you have done this already haven't you beat down  you had a look  what did you make  the experience first  all I would like to say it's been an amazg privilege  X or e privilege to be able to dive  algebra yesterday was my first dive  a submersible it was an amazg experience we went to about 
1791,1.0,havg 10 meters deep  we saw a lot  healthylookg ecosystems rich with st corals  fish so far it looks very good  I hope we will fd the same results  shallow  deeper reefs yeah you say it so far looks very good it all looks pretty healthy it all looks pretty healthy no signs  coal disease those times  plastic pollution  the depth we serve it yesterday  fish seem to be abundant with so many different species  sharks manta rays  so I thk so [] amazg amazg even comg to the surface is amazg because you're comg through surrounded by bubbles  they're gettg bigger  bigger  bigger  bigger next thg you know it's like you thk you're gettg rocked up  down  you pop out  the bright sunlight  you see the ship here  it still washg them down  you feel like you feel like from the depths up to the light  you feel that contrast yes all  it all  it usually different all the way through is right now I know comg up is you know what are the best bits I'm just sounds really strange I mean gog down as well cos y
1792,1.0,ou did it right eat it right down made that first  all  go down quite suddenly even then  then you drop through blue  it's just blue  you  I wasn't waitg to see fish straightaway but it's blue  you until you hit the bottom which is my sy yeah  then we are ridg deeper parts  rocky out  little communities to see SI phan small fish Hooper's gonna shock said clay bar from quite early on the shop didn't want to seem too but they go to vestigate who we are what we are they've never seen us before  we drop down to [] 175 metres we'll say well we thought that's what we thought with  yes but we can be heard just about but we kept communication yes exactly exactly I mean you see they put this plate down but with lights on there too to be right there so we can look up  see that quite clearly  it's not that the fish seem to my catcher  seven wdows yeah there's a shark checkg that out as well how did she believe that me because  is she nervous oh let's just work with yeah so I mean it's always exci
1793,1.0,tg  then we did a dive yesterday but today was was the new is a new spy new environment yeah well then he was worryg me because we went down quite early today  I  he began to talk about us runng out  mushrooms before we actually go on it said that Devorah me so we parked our selves up as best as best we can  a rocky I've got the grabber arm out to hold up  Soraka state Lucy will emerge with samples  she's been dog serious science down there  we'll be usg that for even the cameras to see the enemies perhaps to see the coral  all  that's beg reported  then that will all go to a database  properly analyzed so the science is gog on even with the cameras on I'm sure we can laser there's a highlight especially when you can see the other sunrise when it's lights on up agast this really craggy stable that's when it feels otherworldly  you you see what you must look like because you're just  this lovely pollen from 270 degrees sphere Plus begs me to see so much  then you see what you must look 
1794,1.0,like when you see themself you still get this bug like aliens over 30 seconds left on the program your highlight what was the best moment here [] that one always a shot we had 30 seconds we've now got 20 second always the shark  oddly the journey I tell you what it was I thk it was right at the begng well here we are it was lovely  it was broadcastg first  so many ways  it was a wonderful job very well done  you can see all the highlights on the sky tonight we're back tomorrow 8 o'clock Chese style antics   calm  that is it  the Indonesian []

1804,0.0,"s the color orange. How do you know that\'s the case? Because go  take people\nfrom other language groups, where their language\narbitrarily divides the rabow at other pots with completely\ndifferent color terms,  they remember different\npriles  colors differently than an English speaker might. Take a color. And if the color comes right \nthe center  somebody\'s color characterization,\nif it comes right  the middle  the range\n what counts as that color, people remember whether they\nsaw that color or not far better than if you show them a\ncolor at the boundary. And people will show that as\na function  what language they speak. Takg a contua, \nyou break it to pieces, because it\'s easier to\ndeal with the facts. Another example  it. Here we have four objects. And as drawn here, simply\nbecause we have categories to describe the\nfirst three, do one  those tests  show\npeople a bunch  shapes,  they come back an\nhour later  ask them, Have you seen this shape before? And people are "
1805,0.0,"gog to be\nfar more accurate with this than whether they saw\nthis or not because we don\'t have a word for it. We don\'t have a word that\'s\nat all sort  analytical that some squiggly whatever. We don\'t have a\nclear cut category. g  categories\nmakes it easier for us to remember stuff. And it makes it easier\nfor us to evaluate stuff. So that\'s a classic\nsort  response that we have cognitively\nto complicated thgs. But there\'s a bunch  problems\nwith categorical thkg. First example\n first one you can see from a realm \nlanguage differences  that not only is there a\ncontua  fite number  wavelengths, there\nis a contua  sounds that humans can make. And different languages draw\nboundaries at different pots as to what count as similar\nsounds or different sounds. re\'s like two different\nTH sounds  English, which apparently we\'re\nnot very good at hearg. But there\'s other ones we are. And that will\naffect your ability to remember stuff what\nword it was dependg on whether it "
1806,0.0,"is on a dramatically\ndifferent boundary, whether it is a sound that sounds\ndifferent to you or not. Example  this apparently\n Fnish, people do not differentiate\nbetween the sound  a B  the sound  a P, whereas\nwe have no trouble with that. But people from Fl do\nnot make that differentiation. And I discovered this\none day a number  years ago where, for reasons\nI don\'t even underst, I found myself needg to\ntake to testicular biopsies on baboons. Not havg sort  learned that\n junior high how you do that, I called up this guy at\nurology the med school who happened to be Fnish. And I explaed to him\nwhat I wanted to do. And he sort  took\nme through the paces  told me what thgy I needed\nto buy,  that sort  stuff,  holiday packages  those\nwhere you can get a dozen. And sort  tellg\nme how to do that. And once we went through he\nsaid, What I want you to do, the thg to do at this\npot, is get some practice. I want you to\npractice on a bear. [LAUGHTER] And I said, What? He said, Y"
1807,0.0,"eah. Practice on a bear. And I said, Are you kiddg me? He said, I know. I know it sounds crazy, but we\nhave all the residents do that. It\'s a very good\nlearng device. Either practice on\na bear or an apple. Oh. Oh. Here we see the dangers\n makg mistakes about differences between B \nP under certa circumstances. So we see one \nthe dangers there, which is when you are payg too\nmuch attention to categories, you can\'t differentiate\ntwo facts that fall with the same category. Next example. I remember back at various\npots  anxiety durg exams,  such back when\nwhere there was a world  difference between\ngettg a 65 on a test  a 66 on a test. Not particularly different. But because there is\nthis boundary drawn there between passg  failg,\nthere is this dramatic differentiatg we make. When you put up\nboundaries, you have trouble seeg how\nsimilar thgs are on either side  it. Next example, one\nadditional problem that you get when you\nthk categorically.

This was John Watson, 1912,\none  the foundg fathers  the school  psychology\ncalled behaviorism. Behaviorism that sort\n reached its apogee with this guy BF\nSkner  the 1950s.

At various pots\n the class, we will look at comparisons between\nthe human  the chimp genome,  it\'s virtually the same. Some  the time, we are just a\npla old ftherack animal.

Somethg critical about\nhow the course was designed is it\'s got no prerequisites. Because I really thk this is a\nsubject that everybody on Earth should be forced to learn\nabout it at gunpot. And thus, it\'s a\ngood thg, I thk, to have this not be one \nthose upper level bio classes. Let me just get a\nsense  who\'s here. How many  you are bio\ntypes, bio majors, hum bio? Psychology? Anthro? Are there any English Lit\ngrad students  here? Yeah. OK. Good for you. Thank you for comg here. See what you thk\n three months. But nonetheless, the class\nhas been designed explicitly to have no background\nwhatsoever. How are we gog to do that? We\'re gog to do t"
1832,0.0,"he usual song\n dance  weekly sections,  reviews,  all\nthat sort  thg. But  addition,\ndurg this first half  the course when we\'re jumpg\nfrom category to category, we\'re gog to have each\nweek additional sections a catchup section\nwhich is for people who have no background\n that area, gettg you through the\nbasics,  gettg you up to speed so that you\nwill be able to then know what\'s up durg the lectures. So those will be posted.  first one  these is\nlet me make sure I\'ve got this. Yes. It will be Thursday at\n7:30  the room next door. And this is gog to\nbe the troduction to evolutionary\ntheory  gettg you ready for what will be the\nevolution lectures Wednesday  Friday  this week. If you don\'t have a\nstrong background, go to these catchup sections.  TAs who will be\ngivg that are really expert  those areas, lots\n background,  this will be your chance to catchup. Look through the hout. I thk I have a\nbunch  terms there or somethg where if\nyou are not terribly familiar wit"
1833,0.0,"h those terms \nsome disciple, that\'s a sign that you should probably go\nfor some  the catchup stuff. If you really are\njust dog this, sort  beg very adventurous\nwith no background, if you can take it pass/fail,\nthat will take f a lot  the pressure as well. Because you could then actually\npay attention to stuff here. And the whole\npot here is to be able to do this even if\nyou don\'t have a science background. Because the obvious\nargument I would make is everybody has to\nlearn behavioral biology because we\'re beg behavioral\nbiologists every time we serve on a jury. Every time we vote\nwhether or not money should be spent\non solvg some problem, whether it\'s a problem, \nwhether it\'s solvable or not. Every time we try to\nmake sense  a family member sunk  depression. Are they havg a\nbiochemical disorder, or are they just\ndulgg themselves? We\'re behavioral\nbiologists all the time. So it\'s probably a good thg\nthat we be formed ones. So the catchup sections\nthere take a"
1834,0.0,"dvantage  them. What else? We will have weekly\nsections, the usual type. People are not\nassigned to sections. re\'s gog to be 18  them\nor so a week at various times. Go to whichever works for you. re will be a midterm \nthe middle, the midterm comg as we fish the last \nthose categories, last  those buckets. re will be a fal. re\'s no paper or\nanythg like that. So that will be the pattern. What else? Other stuff here. Office hours my fice\nhours are up on the hout. Other thgs breaks. We will, with any\nluck, be able to be able to be organized enough\nso that durg each stretch  class, there will be a five\nmute break  the middle so you can st\nup,  just get to the front  the\nle for the bathroom,  then we will resume promptly\nbefore you get  there. So just to let you\nclear your heads a bit. Assignments, books, readg. re are two books that I\nhave assigned for the course. One is by me. And you don\'t even\nhave to read it. Just go buy a bunch  copies\n  brg me the receipt,  you\'ve"
1835,0.0," got a\ngreat grade  there. OK, so that\'s what\nis gog to be pertent to the second\nhalf  the course. We\'re gog to give you a\nlist  the chapters that make the most sense to read.  other book is a\nbook by an author named James Gleick called Chaos. Chaos, year, after year,\nafter year,  this class provokes the strongest opions. A quarter  the\npeople decide it is the most irritatg,\nirrelevant thg that could possibly have been\nassigned  the class  hate it. About half the\npeople never quite figure out what\'s up with it. And a quarter  the people,\ntheir life is transformed. y no longer have to meditate. y no longer have to\nhave a they are at peace. At peace, I tell you. Because what this\nbook does is troduce this whole radically different\nway  thkg about biology, takg apart a world\n reductionism. For 500 years, we all have\nbeen usg a very simple model for thkg about\nlivg systems. Which is, if you want\nto underst somethg that\'s complicated, you break\nit apart to its little "
1836,0.0,"pieces. And once you underst\nthe little pieces  put it back\ntogether, you will underst the complex thg. And what Chaos as an\nentire field is about  this was pretty\nmuch the first book that was meant for the lay public\nabout it what Chaos shows is that\'s how you fix clocks. That\'s not how\nyou fix behaviors. That\'s not how you\nunderst behaviors. Behavior is not like a clock. Behavior is like a cloud. And you don\'t\nunderst rafall by breakg a cloud down\nto its component pieces  glug them back together. So read through that book. A lot  it is from physical\nsciences rather than biological, so we\'ll\njust be suggestg the chapters you should read. I will tell you it\nis the first book sce Baby Beluga where\nI\'ve gotten to the last page  immediately started readg\nit over aga from the front. Because along with\nBaby Beluga, it\'s had the greatest\nfluence on my life. I found this to be the most\nfluential book  my thkg about science sce college. So that is a sign. re will also b"
1837,0.0,"e\na bunch  lectures  the second half  the course\ncoverg these fields  chaos  complexity. And if you really\nthk about it, it is gog to force a\nchange  everythg else that you brg to thkg\nabout this subject. In addition, at this moment\nthere is not a reader. Because I\'m tryg to\navoid havg to get you guys to have\nto buy a reader. I\'m tryg to redo all\nthe assigned readgs so that will just be from papers\nthat are available onle, that you\'ll be able to download. I\'m about halfway through\ngettg them there. With any luck, there will\nnot have to be a reader. But if it does exist,\nit\'s not gog to be big. It won\'t be terribly expensive. But there will be a bunch \nreadgs onle to download,  it will vary. In some cases, it will be\nreadg the whole paper. In some cases, I\'ll\nbe suggestg you just read the abstract. In some cases, it will be to\nunderst what\'s happeng  the paper  detail. In some cases,\nthis is an example  how people  this bucket\nthk about this problem. Just read"
1838,0.0," the abstract. So all  that will be\nassigned  made clear. What other stuff? re\'s gog to be a huge\namount  formation onle.  coursework is gog to\nbe set up for the class. re will be copies\n the houts. re will be lecture notes. Lecture notes that I have that\nwill be about five to 10 pages coverg each lecture,\nwhich we\'ll get to about the middle  the course. And I suspect I will run\nout  steam by then. So they won\'t occur\nfor the second half. re will be commonly\nasked questions. re will be a Q&A. re\nwill be course logistics. Some  the slides will\nbe put up  there. Make use  that. re will be announcements\nabout time changg for fice hours,  thgs like that. Make sure you make use  that. And people who are\nnot formally enrolled, we are figurg\nout a way for you to get access to it as well. We\'ve also made the decision\nthat after this lecture, the houts will\nnot be on paper. And that is because\nroughly for each lecture, we will go through about\n5000 pieces  paper, even doub"
1839,0.0,"le sided. l  this stuff will get\nposted on Coursework the day before. And if that\'s gog\nto make it impossible for you to follow what happens\n class because you are the last human on \nwho was not livg f  a computer screen,\ncome  talk to me. And we will slip you an actual\npaper copy  the houts. Most  them, with\nany luck, we can avoid usg paper just because\n how many people there are  here. Let\'s see. Other stuff. Sections will start\nthis Thursday.  regular sections all\n those will be posted, the times for that. Office hours won\'t\nstart until next week.  midterm will\nbe  an eveng rather than durg a class time. And if we are on schedule,\nthe class time that day will be used for review. And anythg else? Oh, a very good suggestion\njust now given that the class before\nhere is humongous,  thus we have the\nimpossible problem  a lot  people\ntryg to get out  that while a lot  people\nare tryg to get to that. It might work best for everybody\nto come  from the top so that you f"
1840,0.0,"low down\nthe stairs seamlessly  drive out those other people\nbefore us out the door there. That might work a\nwhole lot better. Fal thg is we have\na team  TAs here. And they are great. Here they are. TAs, st up \nbe embarrassed. OK, st up, guys. re they are. re is all but one \nthem, who is  transit. re you are. se guys are great. y have either taken\nthe course before. In some cases they have\nTA\'d the course before. y are grad\nstudents  various  the bucket specialties. I would strongly suggest takg\nadvantage  the sections. What will evolve after\nthe first few weeks is there will be the regular\nsections gog over the course material  the usual way. re are also beg more\nadvanced sections for people who have stronger backgrounds. Take advantage. OK, you guys can sit down. Leavg them stg there\nawkwardly for hours afterward. Take advantage  the sections. Really greatly skilled TAs. OK so that\'s basically\nwhat we got gog here. Are there any questions? [INAUDIBLE] Units. OK, some"

And that was because\n Condoleezza Rice. Because when she was\nthe provost here, she totally screwed\nthe biology department by uppg our\nteachg requirements under really nasty conditions. So what we all decided\nwas to fd ways, every sgle sleazy\ntrick we could do to puff up the\nnumber  units we were supposedly teachg. So for a while,\nthe five unit class here would get you six units. But eventually they caught\nus, so we stopped dog that. So first she did that,  then\nweapons  mass destruction. [LAUGHING] So it\'s a five unit\nclass at the moment. Say hi for me if you\nrun to her on campus. So five units.  workload, I thk, will\nbe commensurate with that. But it\'s maly because\n heavy class time. One additional\nthg lectures are gog to be taped  put\nup onle with a day or so on Coursework.  reason for that is given\nthat thi"

In an ideal world,\ngiven the whole emphasis here on no buckets,\nblah blah, et cetera, It would be long essays,\n requirements  sonnets,  sensitive haikus\nabout the hypothalamus.

It\'s an extremely famous map\namong cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom\n the Catskill Mountas, there is a little town called Roscoe  actually, this will go easier\nif I just put it up here  re\'s Roscoe,  then right\nabove Roscoe is Rockl, New York,  then right above that\nis the ty town  Agloe, New York. Agloe, New York, is very famous\nto cartographers, because it\'s a paper town. It\'s also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers  because my map  New York\n your map  New York are gog to look very similar,\non account  the shape  New York  ten, mapmakers will sert\nfake places onto their maps,  order to protect their copyright.

() It had a gas station, a general store,\ntwo houses at its peak.

And I thk the reason that I was\nsuch a terrible student is that I felt like education\nwas just a series  hurdles that had been erected before me,  I had to jump over\n order to achieve adulthood. And I didn\'t really want\nto jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely\narbitrary, so I ten wouldn\'t,  then people would\nthreaten me, you know, they\'d threaten me with this\n""gog on [my] permanent record,"" or ""You\'ll never get a good job."" I didn\'t want a good job! As far as I could tell at eleven\nor twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up\nvery early  the morng, ()  the men who had good jobs,\none  the first thgs they did was tie a strangulation item\n clothg around their necks. y literally put nooses on themselves,  then they went f to their jobs,\nwhatever they were. That\'s not a recipe for a happy life. se people   my, symbolobsessed,\ntwelve "
1849,0.0,"yearold imagation  these people who are stranglg themselves as one  the first thgs\nthey do each morng, they can\'t possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump\nover all  these hurdles  have that be the end? That\'s a terrible end! And then, when I was  tenth grade,\nI went to this school, Indian Sprgs School,\na small boardg school, outside  Birmgham, abama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner,\nbecause I found myself  a community  learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated tellectualism\n engagement,  who thought that my ironic\nohsocool disengagement wasn\'t clever, or funny, but, like, it was a simple\n unspectacular response to very complicated\n compellg problems. And so I started to learn,\nbecause learng was cool. I learned that some fite sets\nare bigger than other fite sets,  I learned that iambic pentameter is\n why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War\nwas a nationalizg conflict, I learned some physics, I lea"

And it\'s true that I don\'t use\nmost  them for my ""job,"" but that\'s not what it\'s about for me. It\'s about cartography. What is the process  cartography? It\'s, you know, sailg\nupon some l,  thkg, ""I thk I\'ll draw that bit  l,""  then wonderg, ""Maybe there\'s\nsome more l to draw."" And that\'s when learng\nreally began for me. It\'s true that I had teachers\nthat didn\'t give up on me,  I was very fortunate\nto have those teachers, because I ten gave them cause to thk\nthere was no reason to vest  me. But a lot  the learng\nthat I did  high school wasn\'t about what happened\nside the classroom, it was about what happened\noutside  the classroom. For stance, I can tell you that ""re\'s a certa Slant  light,\nWter Afternoons  That oppresses, like the Heft\nOf Cathedral Tunes "" not because I memorized\nEmily Dickson  school when I was  high school,"
1851,0.0," but because there was a girl\nwhen I was  high school,  her name was Ama,\n I had a crush on her,  she liked Emily Dickson poetry.  reason I can tell you\nwhat opportunity cost is, is because one day when I was playg\nSuper Mario Kart on my couch, my friend Emmet walked ,  he said, ""How long have you been playg\nSuper Mario Kart?"" And I said, ""I don\'t know,\nlike, six hours?""  he said, ""Do you realize that if you\'d worked\nat BaskRobbs those six hours, you could have made 30 dollars,\nso  some ways, you just paid thirty dollars\nto play Super Mario Kart."" And I was, like, ""I\'ll take that deal."" () But I learned what opportunity cost is. And along the way, the map\n my life got better. It got bigger; it contaed more places. re were more thgs that might happen, more futures I might have. It wasn\'t a formal, organized\nlearng process,  I\'m happy to admit that. It was spotty, it was consistent,\nthere was a lot I didn\'t know. I might know, you know, Cantor\'s idea that some fite set"
1852,0.0,"s are larger\nthan other fite sets, but I didn\'t really underst\nthe calculus behd that idea. I might know the idea  opportunity cost, but I didn\'t know the law\n dimishg returns. But the great thg about imagg\nlearng as cartography, stead  imagg it\nas arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over, is that you see a bit  coastle,\n that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know\nat least some  the calculus that underlies all  that stuff. So, I had one learng community  high school, then I went\nto another for college,  then I went to another, when I started workg\nat a magaze called ""Booklist,"" where I was an assistant, surrounded\nby astonishgly wellread people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream  dog, I promptly quit my job. () And for the first time sce high school, I found myself without a learng\ncommunity,  it was miserable. I hated it. I read many, many books\ndurg this twoyear period. I read books about Stal,  books about how the Uzbek people\ncame to "
1853,0.0,"identify as Muslims,  I read books about\nhow to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like I was\ncreatg my own hurdles,  then jumpg over them myself,\nstead  feelg the excitement  beg part  a community  learners,\na community  people who are engaged together\n the cartographic enterprise  tryg to better underst\n map the world around us. And then,  2006, I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn\'t actually meet him,\njust on the Internet. Ze Frank was runng, at the time,\na show called "" Show with Ze Frank,""  I discovered the show,  that was my way back\nto beg a community learner aga.

This fabrication  place could be one\n the world\'s greatest achievements, because no one belongs here;\neveryone does.

You can go to places like Reddit,\n fd subReddits, like ""Ask a Historian"" or ""Ask ,"" where you can ask people\nwho are  these fields a wide range  questions, from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me, the most "

As  July , 2012, the Higgs boson\nis the last fundamental piece  the stard model  particle physics\nto be discovered experimentally.

So Franz Ferd\nwasn\'t particularly wellliked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph \nnow that is a mustache! But even so, the assassation led Austria\nto issue an ultimatum to Serbia, whereupon Serbia accepted some,\nbut not all,  Austria\'s dems, leadg Austria to declare\nwar agast Serbia.

But teachg is a creative pression. Teachg, properly conceived,\nis not a delivery system. You know, you\'re not there just\nto pass on received formation. Great teachers do that, but what great teachers also do is mentor, stimulate, provoke, engage. You see,  the end,\neducation is about learng. If there\'s no learng gog on,\nthere\'s no education gog on. And people can spend an awful lot  time discussg education\nwithout ever discussg learng.  whole pot  education\nis to get people to learn. An old friend  me \nactually very old, he\'s dead.

But if nobody\'s learng anythg, she may be engaged  the task  teachg\nbut not actually fulfillg it.  role  a teacher\nis to facilitate learng. That\'s it. And part  the problem is, I thk, that the domant culture\n education has come to focus on not teachg  learng, but testg. Now, testg is important. Stardized tests have a place. But they should not be\nthe domant culture  education. y should be diagnostic.\ny should help. () If I go for a medical examation,\nI want some stardized tests. I do.

Our children  teachers are encouraged\nto follow route algorithms rather than to excite that power\n imagation  curiosity. And the third prciple is this:\nthat human life is herently creative. It\'s why we all have different résumés. We create our lives,  we can recreate them\nas we go through them. It\'s the common currency\n beg a human beg. It\'s why human culture\nis so terestg  diverse  dynamic. I mean, other animals may well have\nimagations  creativity, but it\'s not so much\n evidence, is it, as ours? I mean, you may have a dog.

So, neoliberal economic\nassumption number one is that the market is\nan efficient equilibrium system, which basically means that if one thg\n the economy, like wages, goes up, another thg  the economy,\nlike jobs, must go down. So for example,  Seattle, where I live, when  201 we passed\nour nation\'s first 15 dollar mimum wage, the neoliberals freaked out\nover their precious equilibrium.

Except ... they didn\'t.  unemployment rate fell dramatically.  restaurant busess  Seattle boomed. Why? Because there is no equilibrium. Because raisg wages\ndoesn\'t kill jobs, it creates them; because, for stance, when restaurant owners are suddenly\nrequired to pay restaurant work"

() Thank you.  second assumption is that the price  somethg\nis always equal to its value, which basically means\nthat if you earn 50,000 dollars a year  I earn 50 million dollars a year, that\'s because I produce\na thous times as much value as you. Now, it will not surprise you to learn that this is a very comfortg assumption if you\'re a CEO payg yourself\n50 million dollars a year but payg your workers poverty wages. But please, take it from somebody\nwho has run dozens  busesses: this is nonsense. People are not paid what they are worth. y are paid what they have\nthe power to negotiate,  wages\' fallg share  GDP is not because workers\nhave become less productive but because employers\nhave become more powerful.

You can do them tonight at home\nif you feel a little sadistic. You get a rat  you put it  a cage,\n you give it two water bottles: One is just water,  the other is water\nlaced with either hero or cocae. If you do that, the rat will almost always\nprefer the drug water  almost always\nkill itself quite quickly. So there you go, right?\nThat\'s how we thk it works. In the \'70s, Pressor exer comes\nalong  he looks at this experiment  he noticed somethg. He said ah, we\'re puttg\nthe rat  an empty cage. It\'s got nothg to do\nexcept use these drugs.

None  them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose\nwhen they\'re isolated to zero percent overdose when they\nhave happy  connected lives. Now, when he first saw this,\nPressor exer thought, maybe this is just a thg about rats,\nthey\'re quite different to us.

Lookg at this, there was another pressor\ncalled Peter Cohen  the Netherls who said, maybe we shouldn\'t\neven call it addiction. Maybe we should call it bondg. Human begs have a natural\n nate need to bond,  when we\'re happy  healthy,\nwe\'ll bond  connect with each other, but if you can\'t do that, because you\'re traumatized or isolated\nor beaten down by life, you will bond with somethg\nthat will give you some sense  relief.

I\'m lookg at lots  you,  lots\n you have bottles  water with you. Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war. Totally legally, all  those bottles\n water could be bottles  vodka, right?

One percent  the population was addicted\nto hero, which is kd  mdblowg,  every year, they tried\nthe American way more  more. y punished people  stigmatized them\n shamed them more,  every year, the problem got worse.

Let\'s set up a panel\n scientists  doctors to figure out what would\ngenuely solve the problem. And they set up a panel led by\nan amazg man called Dr. João Goulão, to look at all this new evidence,  they came back  they said, ""Decrimalize all drugs\nfrom cannabis to crack, but""   this is the crucial next step  ""take all the money we used to spend\non cuttg add"

So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy,\nthat does have some value. But the biggest thg they did\nwas the complete opposite  what we do: a massive program\n job creation for addicts,  microloans for addicts\nto set up small busesses. So say you used to be a mechanic.

And when I went  met the addicts\n Portugal, what they said is,\nas they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds\n relationships with the wider society.

One  the ways you know it\'s worked\nso well is that almost nobody  Portugal wants to go back to the old system. Now, that\'s the political implications. I actually thk there\'s a layer\n implications to all this research below that. We live  a culture where people\nfeel really creasgly vulnerable to all sorts  addictions,\nwhether it\'s to their smartphones or to shoppg or to eatg. Before these talks began \nyou guys know this  we were told we weren\'t allowed\nto have our smartphones on,  I have to say, a lot  you\nlooked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer\nwas gog to be unavailable for the next couple  hours.

1906,0.0,"We all make decisions every day; we want to know what the right thg is to do   domas from the fancial to the gastronomic to the pressional to the romantic. And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thg at all possible times, that would be a tremendous gift. It turns out that,  fact, the world was given this gift  1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,  I also want to expla to you why it is that it hasn\'t made a damn bit  difference. Now, this is Bernoulli\'s gift. This is a direct quote. And if it looks like Greek to you, it\'s because, well, it\'s Greek. But the simple English translation  much less precise, but it captures the gist  what Bernoulli had to say  was this:  expected value  any  our actions  that is, the goodness that we can count on gettg  is the product  two simple thgs: the odds that this action will allow us to ga somethg,  the value  that ga to us. In a sense, w"
1907,0.0,"hat Bernoulli was sayg is, if we can estimate  multiply these two thgs, we will always know precisely how we should behave. Now, this simple equation, even for those  you who don\'t like equations, is somethg that you\'re quite used to. Here\'s an example: if I were to tell you, let\'s play a little co toss game,  I\'m gog to flip a co,  if it comes up heads, I\'m gog to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege  playg with me, most  you would say, sure, I\'ll take that bet. Because you know that the odds  you wng are one half, the ga if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five,  that\'s more than I\'m chargg you to play. So, the answer is, yes. This is what statisticians technically call a damn fe bet. Now, the idea is simple when we\'re applyg it to co tosses, but  fact, it\'s not very simple  everyday life. People are horrible at estimatg both  these thgs,  that\'s what I want to talk to you about today. re are two kds  errors people make when tryg "
1908,0.0,"to decide what the right thg is to do,  those are errors  estimatg the odds that they\'re gog to succeed,  errors  estimatg the value  their own success. Now, let me talk about the first one first. Calculatg odds would seem to be somethg rather easy: there are six sides to a die, two sides to a co, 52 cards  a deck. You all know what the likelihood is  pullg the ace  spades or  flippg a heads. But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply  everyday life. That\'s why Americans spend more  I should say, lose more  gamblg than on all other forms  entertament combed.  reason is, this isn\'t how people do odds.  way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs. Now, the question I\'m gog to put to you is whether you thk there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed  any particular day  Oxford. And  course, you all know that the answer is dogs. And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed  memory the times you\'ve seen dogs  pigs"
1909,0.0," on leashes. It was very easy to remember seeg dogs, not so easy to remember pigs. And each one  you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your md, then dogs on leashes are more probable. That\'s not a bad rule  thumb, except when it is. So, for example, here\'s a word puzzle. Are there more fourletter English words with R  the third place or R  the first place? Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,  it\'s awfully easy to say to yourself, Rg, Rang, Rung,  very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly. But  fact, there are many more words  the English language with R  the third than the first place.  reason words with R  the third place come slowly to your md isn\'t because they\'re improbable, unlikely or frequent. It\'s because the md recalls words by their first letter. You kd  shout out the sound, S   the word comes. It\'s like the dictionary; it\'s hard to look thgs up by the third letter. So, this is an example  how this idea that"
1910,0.0," the quickness with which thgs come to md can give you a sense  their probability  how this idea could lead you astray. It\'s not just puzzles, though. For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die  a variety  terestg ways  these are estimates  number  deaths per year per 200 million U.S. citizens. And these are just ordary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowng, etc. Compare these to the actual numbers. Now, you see a very terestg pattern here, which is first  all, two thgs are vastly overestimated, namely tornadoes  fireworks. Two thgs are vastly underestimated: dyg by drowng  dyg by asthma. Why? When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper  the headle was, ""Boy dies  Asthma?"" It\'s not terestg because it\'s so common. It\'s very easy for all  us to brg to md stances  news stories or newsreels where we\'ve seen tornadoes devastatg cities, or some poor schmuck who\'s blown his h"
1911,0.0,"s f with a firework on the Fourth  July. Drowngs  asthma deaths don\'t get much coverage. y don\'t come quickly to md,  as a result, we vastly underestimate them. Indeed, this is kd  like the Sesame  game  ""Which thg doesn\'t belong?"" And you\'re right to say it\'s the swimmg pool that doesn\'t belong, because the swimmg pool is the only thg on this slide that\'s actually very dangerous.  way that more  you are likely to die than the combation  all three  the others that you see on the slide.  lottery is an excellent example,  course  an excellent testcase  people\'s ability to compute probabilities. And economists  forgive me, for those  you who play the lottery  but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax, because the odds  gettg any payf by vestg your money  a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushg the money directly down the toilet  which, by the way, doesn\'t require that you actually go to the store  buy anythg. Why  the world"
1912,0.0," would anybody ever play the lottery? Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot  wners. Right? When this couple ws the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check  how the hell do you cash thgs that size, I don\'t know. We see this on TV; we read about it  the paper. When was the last time that you saw extensive terviews with everybody who lost? Indeed, if we required that television stations run a 30second terview with each loser every time they terview a wner, the 100 million losers  the last lottery would require neahalf years  your undivided attention just to watch them say, ""Me? I lost."" ""Me? I lost."" Now, if you watch neahalf years  television  no sleep, no potty breaks   you saw loss after loss after loss,  then at the end there\'s 30 seconds , "" I won,"" the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small. Look, I can prove this to you: here\'s a little lottery. re\'s 10 tickets  this lottery. Ne  them have been sold to "
1913,0.0,"these dividuals. It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket , if you w, you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet? Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.  expected value  this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery  which you should vest your money. And most people say, ""OK, I\'ll play."" Now, a slightly different version  this lottery: image that the ne tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy. Leroy has ne tickets; there\'s one left. Do you want it? Most people won\'t play this lottery. Now, you can see the odds  wng haven\'t changed, but it\'s now fantastically easy to image who\'s gog to w. It\'s easy to see Leroy gettg the check, right? You can\'t say to yourself, ""I\'m as likely to w as anybody,"" because you\'re not as likely to w as Leroy.  fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothg whatsoever to the odds. Now, estimatg odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece  cake compared to tryg to estimate value: tryg to say wha"
1914,0.0,"t somethg is worth, how much we\'ll enjoy it, how much pleasure it will give us. I want to talk now about errors  value. How much is this  Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars? Most  you have the tuition that it\'s not  you wouldn\'t pay that for it. But  fact, to decide whether a  Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one,  only one question, which is: What else can I do with 25 dollars? If you\'ve ever gotten on one  those longhaul flights to Australia  realized that they\'re not gog to serve you any food, but somebody  the row  front  you has just opened the McDonald\'s bag,  the smell  golden arches is waftg over the seat, you thk, I can\'t do anythg else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours. I can\'t even set it on fire  they took my cigarette lighter! Suddenly, 25 dollars for a  Mac might be a good deal. On the other h, if you\'re visitg an underdeveloped country,  25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it\'s exorbitant for a  Mac. Why were you all sure that the answer to the ques"
1915,0.0,"tion was no, before I\'d even told you anythg about the context? Because most  you compared the price  this  Mac to the price you\'re used to payg. Rather than askg, ""What else can I do with my money,"" comparg this vestment to other possible vestments, you compared to the past. And this is a systematic error people make. What you knew is, you paid three dollars  the past; 25 is outrageous. This is an error,  I can prove it to you by showg the kds  irrationalities to which it leads. For example, this is,  course, one  the most delicious tricks  marketg, is to say somethg used to be higher,  suddenly it seems like a very good deal. When people are asked about these two different jobs: a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 0K, a job where you\'re gettg a salary cut each year,  one  which you\'re gettg a salary crease, people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact they\'re all told they make much less money. Why? Because they had the sense that declg wages are worse"
1916,0.0," than risg wages, even when the total amount  wages is higher  the declg period. Here\'s another nice example. Here\'s a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it\'s now on sale for 1,600. Assumg you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package? Most people say they would. Here\'s a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week. By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone  the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no. Why? Because it used to cost 700,  there\'s no way I\'m payg 1,500 for somethg that was 700 last week. This tendency to compare to the past is causg people to pass up the better deal. In other words, a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. Here\'s another example  how comparg to the past can befuddle our decisions. Image that you\'re gog to the theater. You\'re on your way "

When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you\'ve lost the ticket. Would you spend your remag money on replacg it? Most people answer, no. Now, let\'s just change one thg  this scenario. You\'re on your way to the theater,   your wallet you have two 20dollar bills. When you arrive you discover you\'ve lost one  them. Would you spend your remag 20 dollars on a ticket? Well,  course, I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss  20 dollars along the way have to do? Now, just  case you\'re not gettg it, here\'s a schematic  what happened, OK? () ong the way, you lost somethg. In both cases, it was a piece  paper. In one case, it had a U.S. president on it;  the other case it didn\'t. What the hell difference should it make?  difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself, I\'m not payg twice for the same thg. You comp"
1918,0.0,"are the cost  the play now  0 dollars  to the cost that it used to have  20 dollars   you say it\'s a bad deal. Comparg with the past causes many  the problems that behavioral economists  psychologists identify  people\'s attempts to assign value. But even when we compare with the possible, stead  the past, we still make certa kds  mistakes. And I\'m gog to show you one or two  them. One  the thgs we know about comparison: that when we compare one thg to the other, it changes its value. So  1992, this fellow, rge Bush, for those  us who were kd  on the liberal side  the political spectrum, didn\'t seem like such a great guy. Suddenly, we\'re almost longg for him to return. ()  comparison changes how we evaluate him. Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did,  course,  they use this wisdom to help you  spare you the undue burden  money. And so a retailer, if you were to go to a we shop  you had to buy a bottle  we,  you see them here for eight, 27  33 dollars, what would you"
1919,0.0," do? Most people don\'t want the most expensive, they don\'t want the least expensive. So, they will opt for the item  the middle. If you\'re a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf, because suddenly the $33 we doesn\'t look as expensive  comparison. So I\'m tellg you somethg you already knew: namely, that comparison changes the value  thgs. Here\'s why that\'s a problem: the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle  we home, it won\'t matter what it used to be sittg on the shelf next to.  comparisons we make when we are appraisg value, where we\'re tryg to estimate how much we\'ll like thgs, are not the same comparisons we\'ll be makg when we consume them. This problem  shiftg comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example. I have to show you somethg from my own lab, so let me sneak this . se are subjects comg to an experiment to be asked the simplest  all questions: How muc"

For some  the subjects, sittg  the far corner  a room is a box  Godiva chocolates,  for others is a can  Spam. In fact, these items that are sittg  the room change how much the subjects thk they\'re gog to enjoy the potato chips. Namely, those who are lookg at Spam thk potato chips are gog to be quite tasty; those who are lookg at Godiva chocolate thk they won\'t be nearly so tasty. Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips? Well, look, you didn\'t need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful  greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what\'s sittg  the corner  the room makes not a damn bit  difference to your gustatory experience. Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through  change their experience. You\'ve all experienced this yourself, even if you\'ve never come to our lab to eat potato chips. So here"
1921,0.0,"\'s a question: You want to buy a car stereo.  dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks. So would you drive to get 50 percent f, savg 100 dollars? Most people say they would. y can\'t image buyg it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half f. Now, let\'s image stead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,  the dealer near your house had it for 31,000. But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900. Would you drive to get it? At this pot, 0.003 savgs  the 100 dollars. Most people say, no, I\'m gog to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase  a car? This kd  thkg drives economists crazy,  it should. Because this 100 dollars that you save  hello!  doesn\'t know where it came from. It doesn\'t know what you saved it on. When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn\'t go, I\'m the money saved on the car stereo, or, I\'m the dumb money saved o"
1922,0.0,"n the car. It\'s money. And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it\'s worth 100 bucks no matter what you\'re savg it on. People don\'t thk that way. That\'s why they don\'t know whether their mutual fund manager is takg 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent  their vestment, but they clip coupons to save one dollar f  toothpaste. Now, you can see, this is the problem  shiftg comparisons, because what you\'re dog is, you\'re comparg the 100 bucks to the purchase that you\'re makg, but when you go to spend that money you won\'t be makg that comparison. You\'ve all had this experience. If you\'re an American, for example, you\'ve probably traveled  France. And at some pot you may have met a couple from your own hometown,  you thought, ""Oh, my God, these people are so warm. y\'re so nice to me. I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language  hate me more when I don\'t, these people are just wonderful."" And so you tour France with them,  then you get home  y"

In fact, you fd yourself dislikg them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship. Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store, you see two sets  speakers  these big, boxy, monoliths,  these little, sleek speakers,  you play them,  you go, you know, I do hear a difference: the big ones sound a little better. And so you buy them,  you brg them home,  you entirely violate the décor  your house. And the problem,  course, is that this comparison you made  the store is a comparison you\'ll never make aga. What are the odds that years later you\'ll turn on the stereo  go, ""Sounds so much better than those little ones,"" which you can\'t even remember hearg.  problem  shiftg comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. People have a lot  "
1924,0.0,"trouble makg decisions about thgs that will happen at different pots  time. And what psychologists  behavioral economists have discovered is that by  large people use two simple rules. So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem  then a third, hard, problem. Here\'s the first easy problem: You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer? This is what we call a oneitem IQ test, OK? l  us, I hope, prefer more money,  the reason is, we believe more is better than less. Here\'s the second problem: You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars  a month. Which would you prefer? Aga, an easy decision, because we all know that now is better than later. What\'s hard  our decisionmakg is when these two rules conflict. For example, when you\'re fered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars  a month. This typifies a lot  situations  life  which you will ga by waitg, but you have to be patient. What do we know? What do people do  these kds  situations? Well, by  la"
1925,0.0,"rge people are enormously impatient. That is, they require terest rates  the hundred or thouss  percents  order to delay gratification  wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars. Maybe that isn\'t so remarkable, but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changg when the delivery  these monetary units will happen. Image that you can have 50 dollars  a year  that\'s 12 months  or 60 dollars  13 months. What do we fd now? People are gladly willg to wait: as long as they\'re waitg 12, they might as well wait 13. What makes this dynamic consistency happen? Comparison. Troublg comparison. Let me show you. This is just a graph showg the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is, people fd that the subjective value  50 is higher than the subjective value  60 when they\'ll be delivered  now or one month, respectively  a 30day delay  but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision f to the"

What you see here are two lads, one  them larger than the other: the fireman  the fiddler. y are gog to recede towards the vanishg pot  the horizon,  I want you to notice two thgs. At no pot will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No pot. However, the difference between them seems to be gettg smaller. First it\'s an ch  your view, then it\'s a quarterch, then a halfch,  then fally they go f the edge  the earth. Here are the results  what I just showed you. This is the subjective height  the height you saw  these guys at various pots. And I want you to see that two thgs are true. One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;  two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. But watch what happens when we make some  them disappear. Right. At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved. A"
1927,0.0,"s Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value. se are the results  the hard problem I gave you: 60 now or 50  a month? And these are subjective values,  what you can see is, our two rules are preserved. People always thk more is better than less: 60 is always better than 50,  they always thk now is better than later: the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side. Watch what happens when we drop some out. Suddenly we have the dynamic consistency that puzzled us. We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waitg a month, but not if that decision is far  the future. Notice somethg terestg that this implies  namely, that when people get to the future, they will change their mds. That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say, what was I thkg, waitg an extra month for 60 dollars? I\'ll take the 50 dollars now. Well, the question with which I\'d like to end is this: If we\'re so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon? Because I could go on for abo"

Is it the drama  the event  that it\'s so spectacular? Is it the fact that it\'s an tentional attack by, quote, outsiders? What is it? DG: Yes. It\'s a number  thgs,  you hit on several  them.

People died; so be it. But if you got attacked, that was somethg you could do somethg about. And so we evolved these responses. Is that what happened?

One  the problems with makg decisions about the far future  the near future is that we image the near future much more vividly than the far future. To the extent that you can equalize the amount  detail that people put to the mental representations  near  far future, people beg to make decisions about the two  the same way. So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you\'re 65 is a question that\'s very different than, image who you\'ll be when you\'re 65: will you be livg, what will you look like, how much hair will you have, who will you be livg with.

And I wanted to underst why. Why is this happeng to us? Why is it that with each year that passes, more  more  us are fdg it harder\nto get through the day? And I wanted to underst this\nbecause  a more personal mystery. When I was a teenager, I remember gog to my doctor  explag that I had this feelg,\nlike pa was leakg out  me. I couldn\'t control it, I didn\'t underst why it was happeng, I felt quite ashamed  it. And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was welltentioned, but quite oversimplified. Not totally wrong. My doctor said, ""We know\nwhy people get like this. Some people just naturally get\na chemical imbalance  their heads  you\'re clearly one  th"

So I started takg a drug\ncalled Paxil or Seroxat, it\'s the same thg with different names\n different countries. And I felt much better,\nI got a real boost. But not very long afterwards, this feelg  pa started to come back. So I was given higher  higher doses until, for 13 years, I was takg\nthe maximum possible dose that you\'re legally allowed to take. And for a lot  those 13 years,\n pretty much all the time by the end, I was still  a lot  pa. And I started askg myself,\n""What\'s gog on here? Because you\'re dog everythg you\'re told to do by the story\nthat\'s domatg the culture  why do you still feel like this?"" So to get to the bottom\n these two mysteries, for a book that I\'ve written I ended up gog on a big journey\nall over the world, I traveled over 0,000 miles.

But I thk at the heart\n what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for ne different causes\n depression  anxiety. Two  them are deed  our biology. Your genes can make you\nmore sensitive to these problems, though they don\'t write your desty. And there are real bra changes\nthat can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. But most  the factors\nthat have been proven to cause depression  anxiety are not  our biology. y are factors  the way we live. And once you underst them, it opens up a very different\nset  solutions that should be fered to people alongside the option\n chemical antidepressants. For example, if you\'re lonely, you\'re more likely\nto become depressed. If, when you go to work,\nyou don\'t have any control over your job, you\'ve just got to do what you\'re told"

You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. If I took those thgs away from you, you\'d all be  real trouble, real fast. But at the same time, every human beg\nhas natural psychological needs. You need to feel you belong. You need to feel your life\nhas meang  purpose. You need to feel that people\nsee you  value you.

And it only really began\nto fall to place for me when one day, I went to terview\na South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. He\'s a great guy. And Dr. Summerfield\nhappened to be  Cambodia  2001, when they first troduced\nchemical antidepressants for people  that country. And the local doctors, the Cambodians,\nhad never heard  these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explaed. And they said to him, ""We don\'t need them,\nwe\'ve already got antidepressants."" And he was like, ""What do you mean?"" He thought they were gog to talk about\nsome kd  herbal remedy, like St. John\'s Wort, gkgo biloba,\nsomethg like that.

() () If you\'d been raised to thk\nabout depression the way I was,  most  the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? ""I went to my doctor\nfor an antidepressant, she gave me a cow."" But what those Cambodian\ndoctors knew tuitively, based on this dividual,\nunscientific anecdote, is what the leadg\nmedical body  the world, the  Health Organization, has been tryg to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. If you\'re depressed, if you\'re anxious, you\'re not weak, you\'re not crazy, you\'re not,  the ma,\na mache with broken parts. You\'re a human beg with unmet needs.

On the contrary, what they said is, ""We\'re here as a group\nto pull together with you, so together, we can figure out\n fix this problem."" This is what every depressed person needs,  it\'s what every\ndepressed person deserves. This is why one  the leadg\ndoctors at the United ions,  their ficial statement\nfor  Health Day, couple  years back  2017, said we need to talk less\nabout chemical imbalances  more about the imbalances\n the way we live. Drugs give real relief to some people  they gave relief to me for a while  but precisely because this problem\ngoes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. But when I first learned that, I remember thkg, ""OK, I could see\nall the scientific evidence, I read a huge number  studies, I terviewed a huge number  the experts\nwho were explag this,"" but I kept thkg, ""How can we\nposs"

But I want to focus on two  the causes  two  the solutions\nthat emerge from them, if that\'s alright. Here\'s the first. We are the loneliest society\n human history. re was a recent study\nthat asked Americans, ""Do you feel like you\'re no longer\nclose to anyone?"" And 39 percent  people\nsaid that described them.

() I spent a lot  time discussg this with the leadg expert\n the world on loneless, an credible man\nnamed pressor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago,  I thought a lot about one question\nhis work poses to us. Pressor Cacioppo asked, ""Why do we exist? Why are we here, why are we alive?"" One key reason is that our ancestors\non the savannas  Africa were really good at one thg. y weren\'t bigger than the animals\nthey took down a lot  the time, they weren\'t faster than the animals\nthey took down a lot  the time, but they were much better\nat bg together to groups  cooperatg. This was our superpower as a species  we b together, just like bees evolved to live  a hive, humans evolved to live  a tribe. And we are the first humans ever to disb our tribes. And it is makg us feel awful. But it doesn\'t have to be this way. One  the heroes  my book,\n  fact,  my life, "
1963,0.0,"is a doctor named Sam Evergton. He\'s a general practitioner\n a poor part  East London, where I lived for many years. And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads  patients comg to him with terrible\ndepression  anxiety. And like me, he\'s not opposed\nto chemical antidepressants, he thks they give\nsome relief to some people. But he could see two thgs. Firstly, his patients were depressed\n anxious a lot  the time for totally understable\nreasons, like loneless. And secondly, although the drugs\nwere givg some relief to some people, for many people,\nthey didn\'t solve the problem.  underlyg problem. One day, Sam decided\nto pioneer a different approach. A woman came to his center,\nhis medical center, called Lisa Cunngham. I got to know Lisa later. And Lisa had been shut away  her home\nwith cripplg depression  anxiety for seven years. And when she came to Sam\'s center,\nshe was told, ""Don\'t worry, we\'ll carry on givg you these drugs, but we\'re also gog to prescribe\ns"

And his research suggests\nseveral really important thgs. Firstly, the more you believe you can buy  display\nyour way out  sadness,  to a good life, the more likely you are to become\ndepressed  anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become\nmuch more driven by these beliefs. l throughout my lifetime, under the weight  advertisg\n Instagram  everythg like them.

I thk that seems almost like a cliché. But I kept talkg\nto pressor Kasser  sayg, ""Why am I feelg\nthis strange doubleness?"" And he said, ""At some level,\nwe all know these thgs. But  this culture,\nwe don\'t live by them."" We know them so well\nthey\'ve become clichés, but we don\'t live by them. I kept askg why, why would we know\nsomethg so pround, but not live by it?

And pressor Kasser wanted to figure out\nif we can disrupt that mache. He\'s done loads  research to this; I\'ll tell you about one example,  I really urge everyone here\nto try this with their friends  family. With a guy called han Dungan,\nhe got a group  teenagers  adults to come together for a series  sessions\nover a period  time, to meet up. And part  the pot  the group was to get people to thk\nabout a moment  their life they had actually found\nmeang  purpose. For different people,\nit was different thgs.

And I said, ""So is it true\nthat you faked your way  here?"" And he said, ""Yep. Yep. Absolutely.\nI beat someone up when I was 17. And I was  prison awaitg trial,  my cellmate said to me, \'You know what you have to do? Fake madness. Tell them you\'re mad, you\'ll get\nsent to some cushy hospital.

So I said to the psychiatrist, \'I get sexual pleasure\nfrom crashg cars to walls.\'"" And I said, ""What else?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah.\nI told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died, because it would make\nme feel more normal."" I said, ""Where\'d you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from a biography\n Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library."" Anyway, he faked madness\ntoo well, he said. And they didn\'t send him\nto some cushy hospital. y sent him to Broadmoor. And the mute he got there, said he took one look at the place,\nasked to see the psychiatrist, said, ""re\'s been\na terrible misunderstg. I\'m not mentally ill."" I said, ""How long have you been here for?"" He said, ""Well, if I\'d just\ndone my time  prison for the origal crime,\nI\'d have got five years. I\'ve been  Broadmoor for 12"

He said, ""I thought\nthe best way to seem normal would be to talk to people\nnormally about normal thgs like football or what\'s on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist,  recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was trag\nbumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, \'Did you know that the U.S. Army\nis trag bumblebees to sniff out explosives?\' When I read my medical notes,\nI saw they\'d written: \'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.\'"" () He said, ""You know, they\'re always\nlookg out for nonverbal clues to my mental state.

So, only  Broadmoor would not wantg\nto hang out with serial killers be a sign  madness. Anyway, he seemed completely normal\nto me, but what did I know? And when I got home I emailed\nhis clician, Anthony Maden. I said, ""What\'s the story?"" And he said, ""Yep.\nWe accept that Tony faked madness to get out  a prison sentence,\nbecause his hallucations  that had seemed\nquite cliche to beg with  just vanished the mute\nhe got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him,  we\'ve determed that what he is is a psychopath."" And  fact, fakg madness is exactly the kd  cunng\n manipulative act  a psychopath. It\'s on the checklist:\ncunng, manipulative. So, fakg your bra gog wrong is evidence that your bra\nhas gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts,  they said the pstripe\nsuit  classic psychopath  speaks to "

Classic psychopath  it speaks\nto griosity  also lack  empathy. So all the thgs that had seemed\nmost normal about Tony was evidence, accordg to his clician, that he was mad  this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clician said to me, ""If you\nwant to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopathspottg course run by Robert Hare, who vented\nthe psychopath checklist."" So I did. I went on a psychopathspottg course,  I am now a certified   I have to say, extremely adept \npsychopath spotter. So, here\'s the statistics: One  a hundred regular people\nis a psychopath.

No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge\n how to spot deception. y use it to get to the truth,  they do what mature\nleaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations\nwith difficult people, sometimes durg very difficult times. And they start up that path\nby acceptg a core proposition,  that proposition is the followg: Lyg is a cooperative act.  about it, a lie has no power\nwhatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees\nto believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some pot\nyou got lied to, it\'s because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lyg:\nLyg\'s a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we\'re willg\nparticipants  deception for the sake  social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should\nbe kept secret, secret. We say, ""Nice song."" ""Honey,"
1990,0.0," you don\'t look fat  that, no."" Or we say, favorite  the digiratti, ""You know, I just fished\nthat email out  my Spam folder. So sorry."" But there are times when we are unwillg\nparticipants  deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars  corporate fraud alone\n the United States. That\'s an eyelash\nunder a trillion dollars. That\'s seven percent  revenues. Deception can cost billions.  Enron, Madf, the mortgage crisis. Or  the case\n double agents  traitors, like Robert Hanssen or drich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,\nthey can underme democracy, they can cause the deaths\n those that defend us. Deception is actually serious busess. This con man, Henry Oberler,\nhe was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermed the entire\nbankg system  the Western world. And you can\'t fd this guy on Google;\nyou can\'t fd him anywhere. He was terviewed once,\n he said the followg. He said, """
1991,0.0,"Look, I\'ve got one rule."" And this was Henry\'s rule, he said, ""Look, everyone is willg\nto give you somethg. y\'re ready to give you somethg\nfor whatever it is they\'re hungry for."" And that\'s the crux  it. If you don\'t want to be\ndeceived, you have to know, what is it that you\'re hungry for? And we all kd  hate to admit it. We wish we were\nbetter husbs, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer  the list goes on. Lyg is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes  our fantasies about who we wish we were,\nhow we wish we could be, with what we\'re really like. And boy are we willg to fill \nthose gaps  our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show\nthat you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many  those are white lies. But  another study, it showed that strangers lied three times with the first 10 mutes\n meetg each other. () Now when we first hear\nthis data, we recoil. We can\'t believe how prevalent lyg is. We\'re essentially a"

Men lie eight times more about themselves\nthan they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you\'re an average married couple, you\'re gog to lie to your spouse\n one out  every 10 teractions. Now, you may thk that\'s bad. If you\'re unmarried,\nthat number drops to three. Lyg\'s complex. It\'s woven to the fabric\n our daily  our busess lives. We\'re deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an asneeded basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because\nwe don\'t underst the gaps  our lives. That\'s truth number two about lyg. We\'re agast lyg, but we\'re covertly for it  ways that our society has sanctioned\nfor centuries  centuries  centuries. It\'s as old as breathg. It\'s part  our culture,\nit\'s part  our history.

But now all  a sudden\nmy job is very different,  my job is to be\nout here talkg about it, talkg about troversion. () And that\'s a lot harder for me, because as honored as I am\nto be here with all  you right now, this is not my natural milieu. So I prepared for moments\nlike these as best I could. I spent the last year\npracticg public speakg every chance I could get. And I call this my ""year\n speakg dangerously."" () And that actually he"
2033,0.0,"lped a lot. But I\'ll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope\nthat when it comes to our attitudes to troversion  to quiet\n to solitude, we  are poised on the brk\non dramatic change. I mean, we are. And so I am gog to leave you now with three calls for action\nfor those who share this vision. Number one: Stop the madness for constant group work. Just stop it. () Thank you. () And I want to be clear\nabout what I\'m sayg, because I deeply believe our fices should be encouragg casual, chatty\ncafestyle types  teractions  you know, the kd\nwhere people come together  serendipitously have\nan exchange  ideas. That is great. It\'s great for troverts\n it\'s great for extroverts. But we need much more privacy\n much more freedom  much more autonomy at work. School, same thg. We need to be teachg kids\nto work together, for sure, but we also need to be teachg them\nhow to work on their own. This is especially important\nfor extroverted children too. y need to work on "
2034,0.0,"their own because that is where deep thought\ncomes from  part. Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness. Be like Buddha, have your own revelations. I\'m not sayg that we all have to now go f  build\nour own cabs  the woods  never talk to each other aga, but I am sayg that we could\nall st to unplug  get side our own heads\na little more ten. Number three: Take a good look\nat what\'s side your own suitcase  why you put it there. So extroverts, maybe your suitcases\nare also full  books. Or maybe they\'re full  champagne glasses\nor skydivg equipment. Whatever it is, I hope you take\nthese thgs out every chance you get  grace us with your energy\n your joy. But troverts, you beg you, you probably have the impulse\nto guard very carefully what\'s side your own suitcase. And that\'s okay. But occasionally, just occasionally, I hope you will open up your suitcases\nfor other people to see, because the world needs you  it\nneeds the thgs you carry. So I wish you the best\n all possible journ"
2035,0.0,eys  the courage to speak stly. Thank you very much. () Thank you. Thank you. ()
2036,0.0,"Chris Anderson:\nElon, hey, welcome back to . It\'s great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for havg me. CA: So,  the next half hour or so, we\'re gog to spend some time explorg your vision for what\nan excitg future might look like, which I guess makes\nthe first question a little ironic: Why are you borg? EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We\'re tryg to dig a hole under LA,  this is to create the begng  what will hopefully\nbe a 3D network  tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one  the most\nsouldestroyg thgs is traffic. It affects people\n every part  the world. It takes away so much  your life. It\'s horrible. It\'s particularly horrible  LA. () CA: I thk you\'ve brought with you the first visualization\nthat\'s been shown  this. Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.\nSo this is the first time  Just to show what we\'re talkg about. So a couple  key thgs\nthat are important  havg a 3D tunnel network. First  all, you have to be able to tegrate the entrance\n exit  "
2037,0.0,"the tunnel seamlessly to the fabric  the city. So by havg an elevator, sort  a car skate,\nthat\'s on an elevator, you can tegrate the entrance\n exits to the tunnel network just by usg two parkg spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. re\'s no speed limit here, so we\'re designg this to be able\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\nor about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX  six mutes  five, six mutes. () CA: So possibly, itially done, it\'s like on a sort\n toll roadtype basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,\nalleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don\'t know\nif people noticed it  the video, but there\'s no real limit\nto how many levels  tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep\nthan you can go up.  deepest mes are much deeper\nthan the tallest buildgs are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary\nlevel  urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a v"
2038,0.0,"ery important pot. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\nis that if you add one layer  tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,\nit will get used up,  then you\'ll be back where you started,\nback with congestion. But you can go to any\narbitrary number  tunnels, any number  levels. CA: But people  seen traditionally,\nit\'s credibly expensive to dig,  that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they\'re right. To give you an example,\nthe LA subway extension, which is  I thk it\'s\na twoahalf mile extension that was just completed\nfor two billion dollars. So it\'s roughly a billion dollars a mile\nto do the subway extension  LA. And this is not the highest\nutility subway  the world. So yeah, it\'s quite difficult\nto dig tunnels normally. I thk we need to have\nat least a tenfold improvement  the cost per mile  tunnelg. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two thgs, you can get to approximately\nan order  magnitude improvement,  I thk you can go beyond"
2039,0.0," that. So the first thg to do\nis to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor  two or more. So a sgle road lane tunnel\naccordg to regulations has to be 26 feet,\nmaybe 28 feet  diameter to allow for crashes\n emergency vehicles  sufficient ventilation\nfor combustion enge cars. But if you shrk that diameter\nto what we\'re attemptg, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\nto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor  two  the crosssectional area\nby a factor  four,  the tunnelg cost scales\nwith the crosssectional area. So that\'s roughly a halforder\n magnitude improvement right there. n tunnelg maches currently tunnel\nfor half the time, then they stop,  then the rest  the time\nis puttg  reforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the mache stead to do contuous\ntunnelg  reforcg, that will give you\na factor  two improvement. Combe that  that\'s a factor  eight. so these maches are far from beg\nat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\nto "
2040,0.0,"the mache substantially. I thk you can get\nat least a factor  two, maybe a factor  four or five\nimprovement on top  that. So I thk there\'s a fairly\nstraightforward series  steps to get somewhere  excess\n an order  magnitude improvement  the cost per mile,  our target actually is  we\'ve got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\nfrom ""South Park,"" I mean, sorry, ""SpongeBob SquarePants."" () So Gary is capable   currently he\'s capable\n gog 1 times faster than a tunnelborg mache. () CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. () He\'s not a patient little fellow,  that will be victory. Victory is beatg the snail. CA: But a lot  people imagg,\ndreamg about future cities, they image that actually\nthe solution is flyg cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn\'t that a better solution? You save all that tunnelg cost. EM: Right. I\'m  favor  flyg thgs. Obviously, I do rockets,\nso I like thgs that fly. This is not some herent bias\nagast flyg thgs, but the"
2041,0.0,"re is a challenge with flyg cars  that they\'ll be quite noisy, the wd force generated\nwill be very high. Let\'s just say that if somethg\'s\nflyg over your head, a whole bunch  flyg cars\ngog all over the place, that is not an anxietyreducg situation. () You don\'t thk to yourself,\n""Well, I feel better about today."" You\'re thkg,\n""Did they service their hubcap, or is it gog to come f\n guillote me?"" Thgs like that. CA: So you\'ve got this vision  future cities with these rich,\n3D networks  tunnels underneath. Is there a tie here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels\nto use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we\'ve been\nsort  putterg around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track\nadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage novative\nideas  transport. And it actually ends up beg\nthe biggest vacuum chamber  the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that"
2042,0.0,",\nbut it was kd  a hobby thg,  then we thk we might  so we\'ve built a little pusher car\nto push the student pods, but we\'re gog to try seeg\nhow fast we can make the pusher go if it\'s not pushg somethg. So we\'re cautiously optimistic we\'ll be able to be faster\nthan the world\'s fastest bullet tra even  a .8mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it\'s  yeah. It\'s either gog to smash\nto ty pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,\nthen, a Hyperloop  a tunnel runng quite long distances. EM: Exactly. And lookg at tunnelg technology, it turns out that\n order to make a tunnel, you have to  In order to seal agast the water table, you\'ve got to typically design\na tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or nearvacuum. So actually, it sort  turns out\nthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough\nto resist the water table, it is automatically\ncapable  holdg vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So,"
2043,0.0," yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture, what kd  length tunnel\nis  Elon\'s future to runng Hyperloop? EM: I thk there\'s no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I thk if you were to do somethg like a DCtoNew York Hyperloop, I thk you\'d probably want\nto go underground the entire way because it\'s a highdensity area. You\'re gog under\na lot  buildgs  houses,  if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people thk,\nwell, it\'s gog to be pretty annoyg to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four\ntunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able\nto detect it beg dug at all. In fact, if you\'re able\nto detect the tunnel beg dug, whatever device you are usg, you can get a lot  money\nfor that device from the Israeli military, who is tryg to detect\ntunnels from Hamas,  from the US Customs  Border patrol\nthat try  detect drug tunnels. So the reality is that earth is credibly good\nat ab"
2044,0.0,"sorbg vibrations,  once the tunnel depth\nis below a certa level, it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive\nseismic strument, you might be able to detect it. CA: So you\'ve started\na new company to do this called  Borg Company. Very nice. Very funny. () EM: What\'s funny about that? () CA: How much  your time is this? EM: It\'s maybe ... two or three percent. CA: You\'ve called it a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk\nhobby looks like. () EM: I mean, it really is, like  This is basically terns\n people dog it part time. We bought some secondh machery. It\'s kd  putterg along,\nbut it\'s makg good progress, so  CA: So an even bigger part  your time is beg spent on electrifyg\ncars  transport through Tesla. Is one  the motivations\nfor the tunnelg project the realization that actually,  a world where cars are electric\n where they\'re selfdrivg, there may end up beg\nmore cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot  people thk\nthat when "
2045,0.0,"you make cars autonomous, they\'ll be able to go faster\n that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy\nwhere it\'s much cheaper to go by car  you can go pot to pot, the affordability  gog  a car\nwill be better than that  a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount  drivg that will occur\nwill be much greater with shared autonomy,  actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Tesla\nwith the goal  persuadg the world that electrification\nwas the future  cars,  a few years ago,\npeople were laughg at you. Now, not so much. EM: OK. () I don\'t know. I don\'t know. CA: But isn\'t it true that pretty much\nevery auto manufacturer has announced\nserious electrification plans for the short to mediumterm future? EM: Yeah. Yeah. I thk almost every automaker\nhas some electric vehicle program. y vary  seriousness. Some are very serious\nabout transitiong entirely to electric,  some are just dabblg  it. And s"

CA: But isn\'t there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory\n say, you know, ""We did it."" Let the world electrify,\n you go on  focus on other stuff? EM: Yeah. I tend to stay with Tesla\nas far to the future as I can image,  there are a lot  excitg\nthgs that we have comg. Obviously the Model 3 is comg soon. We\'ll be unveilg the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we\'re gog to come to this. So Model 3, it\'s supposed\nto be comg  Julyish. EM: Yeah, it\'s lookg quite good\nfor startg production  July. CA: Wow. One  the thgs\nthat people are so excited about is the fact that it\'s got autopilot. And you put out this video a while back showg what that technology\nwould look like. EM: Yeah. CA: re\'s obviously autopilot\n Model S right now. What are we seeg here? EM: Yeah, so this is usg\nonly cameras  GPS. So there\'s no LIDAR\nor radar beg used here. This is just usg passive optical,\nwhich"
2047,0.0," is essentially what a person uses.  whole road system\nis meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras,  so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved. If you don\'t solve vision,\nit\'s not solved. So that\'s why our focus is\nso heavily on havg a vision neural net that\'s very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other people\nare gog the LIDAR route. You want cameras plus radar is most  it. EM: You can absolutely\nbe superhuman with just cameras. Like, you can probably do it\nten times better than humans would, just cameras. CA: So the new cars beg sold right now\nhave eight cameras  them. y can\'t yet do what that showed. When will they be able to? EM: I thk we\'re still on track\nfor beg able to go crosscountry from LA to New York by the end\n the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the end\n the year, you\'re sayg, someone\'s gog to sit  a Tesla\nwithout touchg the steerg wheel, tap  ""New York,"" f it goes. EM: Yeah. CA: Won\'t ever have to to"
2048,0.0,"uch the wheel \nby the end  2017. EM: Yeah. Essentially,\nNovember or December  this year, we should be able to go all the way\nfrom a parkg lot  California to a parkg lot  New York, no controls touched at any pot\ndurg the entire journey. () CA: Amazg. But part  that is possible because you\'ve already got a fleet\n Teslas drivg all these roads. You\'re accumulatg a huge amount\n data  that national road system. EM: Yes, but the thg\nthat will be terestg is that I\'m actually fairly confident\nit will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically. So, it\'s fairly easy  If you say I\'m gog to be really good\nat one specific route, that\'s one thg, but it should be able to go,\nreally be very good, certaly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system  a given country. So it\'s not sort  limited\nto LA to New York. We could change it\n make it SeattleFlorida, that day,  real time. So you were gog from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto. CA: S"
2049,0.0,"o leavg aside\nregulation for a second,  terms  the technology alone, the time when someone\nwill be able to buy one  your cars  literally just take the hs\nf the wheel  go to sleep  wake up  fd that they\'ve arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I thk that\'s about two years. So the real trick  it\nis not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent  the time, because, like, if a car crashes\none  a thous times, then you\'re probably still not gog\nto be comfortable fallg asleep. You shouldn\'t be, certaly. () It\'s never gog to be perfect. No system is gog to be perfect, but if you say it\'s perhaps  the car is unlikely to crash  a hundred lifetimes,\nor a thous lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow,\nif I were to live a thous lives, I would still most likely\nnever experience a crash, then that\'s probably OK. CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern  yours\nis that people may actually get seduced too early\nto thk that this is safe,  that you\'ll have some horrible\ncid"
2050,0.0,"ent happen that puts thgs back. EM: Well, I thk that the autonomy system\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash, except  rare circumstances.  thg to appreciate\nabout vehicle safety is this is probabilistic. I mean, there\'s some chance that any time\na human driver gets  a car, that they will have an accident\nthat is their fault. It\'s never zero. So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy\nneed to be than a person before you can rely on it? CA: But once you get\nliterally safe hsf drivg, the power to disrupt\nthe whole dustry seems massive, because at that pot you\'ve spoken\n people beg able to buy a car, drops you f at work,\n then you let it go  provide a sort  Uberlike\nservice to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost\n your lease  that car, so you can kd  get a car for free. Is that really likely? EM: Yeah. Absolutely\nthis is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car  you can choose\nto"
2051,0.0," use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used\nonly by friends  family, only by other drivers\nwho are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes\nbut not other times. That\'s 100 percent what will occur. It\'s just a question  when. CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi  I thk you\'re planng\nto announce this  September, but I\'m curious whether there\'s\nanythg you could show us today? EM: I will show you\na teaser shot  the truck. () It\'s alive. CA: OK. EM: That\'s defitely a case\nwhere we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah. () CA: We can\'t see that much  it, but it doesn\'t look like\njust a little friendly neighborhood truck. It looks kd  badass. What sort  semi is this? EM: So this is a heavy duty,\nlongrange semitruck. So it\'s the highest weight capability  with long range. So essentially it\'s meant to alleviate\nthe heavyduty truckg loads. And this is somethg which\npeople do not today thk is possible. y thk the truck doesn\'t ha"

And if you had a tugwar competition, the Tesla Semi\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill. () () CA: That\'s pretty cool.\nAnd short term, these aren\'t driverless. se are gog to be trucks\nthat truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will be\nreally fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve\nwith an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kd\n ternal combustion enge car, you\'ve got a torque RPM curve\nthat looks like a hill. So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this\naround like a sports car. re\'s no gears.\nIt\'s, like, sgle speed. CA: re\'s a great movie\nto be made here somewhere.

If you look  between\nthe electric car  the house, there are actually three Powerwalls\nstacked up agast the side  the house,  then that house ro is a solar ro. So that\'s an actual solar glass ro. CA: OK. EM: That\'s a picture  a real \nwell, admittedly, it\'s a real fake house. That\'s a real fake house. () CA: So these ro tiles, some  them have  them\nbasically solar power, the ability to "

Solar glass tiles where you can adjust\nthe texture  the color to a very fegraed level,  then there\'s\nsort  microlouvers  the glass, such that when you\'re lookg\nat the ro from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell\nbehd it or not. So you have an even color from the ground level. If you were to look at it\nfrom a helicopter, you would be actually able\nto look through  see that some  the glass tiles have\na solar cell behd them  some do not. You can\'t tell from street level. CA: You put them  the ones\nthat are likely to see a lot  sun,  that makes these ros\nsuper affordable, right? y\'re not that much more expensive\nthan just tilg the ro. EM: Yeah. We\'re very confident\nthat the cost  the ro plus the cost  electricity  A solar glass ro will be less\nthan the cost  a normal ro plus the cost  electricity. So  other words, this will be economically a nobraer, we thk it will look great,  it will last  We thought "

Well after the house has collapsed  there\'s nothg there, the glass tiles will still be there. () CA: I mean, this is cool. So you\'re rollg this out\n a couple week\'s time, I thk, with four different rog types. EM: Yeah, we\'re startg f\nwith two, two itially,  the second two\nwill be troduced early next year. CA: And what\'s the scale  ambition here? How many houses do you believe\ncould end up havg this type  rog? EM: I thk eventually almost all houses will have a solar ro.  thg is to consider\nthe time scale here to be probably on the order  0 or 50 years. So on average, a ro\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don\'t start replacg\nall ros immediately. But eventually,\nif you say were to fastforward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a ro\nthat does not have solar. CA: Is there a mental model thg\nthat peop"
2056,0.0,"le don\'t get here that because  the shift  the cost,\nthe economics  solar power, most houses actually have\nenough sunlight on their ro pretty much to power all  their needs. If you could capture the power, it could pretty much\npower all their needs. You could go fgrid, kd . EM: It depends on where you are  what the house size is\nrelative to the ro area, but it\'s a fair statement to say that most houses  the US\nhave enough ro area to power all the needs  the house. CA: So the key to the economics  the cars, the Semi,  these houses is the fallg price\n lithiumion batteries, which you\'ve made a huge bet on as Tesla. In many ways, that\'s almost\nthe core competency. And you\'ve decided that to really, like, own that competency, you just have to build\nthe world\'s largest manufacturg plant to double the world\'s supply\n lithiumion batteries, with this guy. What is this? EM: Yeah, so that\'s the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory. Eventually, you can sort  roughly see"

That\'s the sum total  my contribution.

() CA: I thought that was\nthe spedup version. But I mean, that\'s amazg,  several  these failed before you fally\nfigured out how to do it, but now you\'ve done this,\nwhat, five or six times? EM: We\'re at eight or ne. CA: And for the first time, you\'ve actually reflown\none  the rockets that led.

() In units  77, a 77 is only about\na quarter  a million pounds  thrust, so for every 10 million pounds  thrust, there\'s 0 77s.

And to be fair, you\'ve done\na fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustaable energy. But why not just do that? EM: I thk there\'s  I look at the future\nfrom the stpot  probabilities. It\'s like a branchg\nstream  probabilities,  there are actions that we can take\nthat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thg\nor slow down another thg. I may troduce somethg new\nto the probability stream. Sustaable energy\nwill happen no matter what. If there was "
2064,0.0,"no Tesla,\nif Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out  necessity. It\'s tautological. If you don\'t have sustaable energy,\nit means you have unsustaable energy. Eventually you will run out,  the laws  economics\nwill drive civilization towards sustaable energy, evitably.  fundamental value\n a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates\nthe advent  sustaable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I thk, like, what is the fundamental good\n a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,\npotentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thg to occur. That\'s what I consider to be the fundamental\naspirational good  Tesla. n there\'s becomg a multiplanet\nspecies  spacefarg civilization. This is not evitable. It\'s very important to appreciate\nthis is not evitable.  sustaable energy future\nI thk is largely evitable, but beg a spacefarg civilization\nis defitely not evitable. If you look at the progress  "

Space Shuttle could only\ntake people to low Earth orbit. n the Space Shuttle retired,  the United States\ncould take no one to orbit. So that\'s the trend.  trend is like down to nothg.

To survive we have to reach\nbeyond the home planet.  what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished\nwere suddenly obliterated.

Two million years ago\nhumans evolved  Africa  then slowly but surely\nspread out across the entire planet by reachg to the wilderness\nthat was beyond th"
2069,0.0,"eir horizons. This stuff is side us. And they prospered dog that. Some  the greatest advances\n civilization  technology came because we explored.

And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars\nthe way we\'ve screwed up Earth. But thk for a moment, what we had when John F. Kennedy\ntold us we would put a human on the moon. He excited an entire generation to dream.  how spired we will be\nto see a lg on Mars. Perhaps then we will look back at Earth  see that that is\none people stead  many  perhaps then\nwe will look back at Earth, as we struggle to survive on Mars,  realize how precious\nthe home planet is. So let me tell you about the extraordary\nadventure we\'re about to undertake. But first, a few fascatg facts\nabout where we\'re gog. This picture actually represents\nthe true size  Mars compared to Earth. Mars is not our si"
2070,0.0,"ster planet. It\'s far less than half\nthe size  the Earth,  yet despite the fact\nthat it\'s smaller, the surface area  Mars\nthat you can st on is equivalent to the surface area\n the Earth that you can st on, because the Earth\nis mostly covered by water.  atmosphere on Mars is really th  100 times thner than on Earth   it\'s not breathable,\nit\'s 96 percent carbon dioxide. It\'s really cold there.  average temperature\nis mus 81 degrees, although there is\nquite a range  temperature. A day on Mars is about as long\nas a day on Earth, plus about 39 mutes. Seasons  years on Mars\nare twice as long as they are on Earth. And for anybody who wants to strap\non some wgs  go flyg one day, Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,  it\'s the kd  place where you can jump over your car\nstead  walk around it. Now, as you can see,\nMars isn\'t exactly Earthlike, but it\'s by far the most livable\nother place  our entire solar system. Here\'s the problem. Mars is a long way away, a thous tim"
2071,0.0,"es farther away\nfrom us than our own moon.  Moon is 250,000 miles away  it took Apollo astronauts\nthree days to get there. Mars is 250 million miles away  it will take us\neight months to get there  20 days. And that\'s only if we launch\non a very specific day, at a very specific time, once every two years, when Mars  the Earth\nare aligned just so, so the distance that the rocket\nwould have to travel will be the shortest. 20 days is a long time to spend\ntrapped with your colleagues  a t can. And meanwhile, our track record\n gettg to Mars is lousy. We  the Russians,\nthe Europeans, the Japanese, the Chese  the Indians, have actually sent  rockets there,  the vast majority  them\nhave either missed or crashed. Only about a third  the missions\nto Mars have been successful. And we don\'t at the moment have\na rocket big enough to get there anyway. We once had that rocket, the Saturn V. A couple  Saturn Vs\nwould have gotten us there. It was the most magnificent\nmache ever built by"
2072,0.0," humans,  it was the rocket\nthat took us to the Moon. But the last Saturn V was used  1973\nto launch the lab space station,  we decided to do\nsomethg called the shuttle stead  contug on to Mars\nafter we led on the Moon.  biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough\nto get us anythg to Mars. So gettg to Mars is not gog to be easy  that brgs up\na really terestg question ... how soon will the first humans\nactually l here? Now, some pundits thk\nif we got there by 2050, that\'d be a pretty good achievement. se days,  seems to be sayg\nthat it can get humans to Mars by 200. Maybe they can. I believe that they can get\nhuman begs to Mars orbit by 2035. But frankly, I don\'t thk they\'re gog to bother\n 2035 to send a rocket to Mars, because we will already be there. We\'re gog to l on Mars  2027. And the reason is this man is determed\nto make that happen. His name is Elon Musk,\nhe\'s the CEO  Tesla Motors  SpaceX. Now, he actually told me\nthat we would l on Mars by 2025, but "
2073,0.0,"Elon Musk is more\noptimistic than I am   that\'s gog a ways  so I\'m givg him\na couple  years  slack. Still ... you\'ve got to ask yourself, can this guy really do this\nby 2025 or 2027? Well, let\'s put a decade with Elon Musk\nto a little perspective. Where was this 10 years ago? That\'s the Tesla electric automobile. In 2005, a lot  people\n the automobile dustry were sayg, we would not have\na decent electric car for 50 years. And where was that? That is SpaceX\'s Falcon 9 rocket, liftg six tons  supplies\nto the International Space Station. 10 years ago, SpaceX had not launched anythg,\nor fired a rocket to anywhere. So I thk it\'s a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizg\nthe automobile dustry  less than 10 years  the person who created an entire\nrocket company  less than 10 years will get us to Mars by 2027. Now, you need to know this: governments  robots\nno longer control this game. Private companies are leapg to space  they will be happy\nto take you to Mars."
2074,0.0," And that raises a really big question. Can we actually live there? Now,  may not be able\nto get us there until 200, or we may get there\na long time before , but  has taken a huge responsibility\n figurg out how we can live on Mars. Let\'s look at the problem this way. Here\'s what you need to live on Earth: food, water, shelter  clothg. And here\'s what you need to live on Mars: all  the above, plus oxygen. So let\'s look at the most\nimportant thg on this list first. Water is the basis\n all life as we know it,  it\'s far too heavy for us to carry\nwater from the Earth to Mars to live, so we have to fd water\nif our life is gog to succeed on Mars. And if you look at Mars,\nit looks really dry, it looks like the entire\nplanet is a desert. But it turns out that it\'s not.  soil alone on Mars\ncontas up to 60 percent water. And a number  orbiters that we still\nhave flyg around Mars have shown us   by the way,\nthat\'s a real photograph  that lots  craters on Mars\nhave a sheet  wate"
2075,0.0,"r ice  them. It\'s not a bad place to start a colony. Now, here\'s a view  a little dig\nthe Phoenix Ler did  2008, showg that just below\nthe surface  the soil is ice  that white stuff is ice. In the second picture, which is four days later\nthan the first picture, you can see that\nsome  it is evaporatg. Orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts\n underground water on Mars as well as glaciers. In fact, if only the water ice\nat the poles on Mars melted, most  the planet\nwould be under 30 feet  water. So there\'s plenty  water there, but most  it\'s ice,\nmost  it\'s underground, it takes a lot  energy to get it\n a lot  human labor. This is a device cooked up\nat the   Washgton back  1998. It\'s basically a lowtech dehumidifier. And it turns out the Mars atmosphere\nis ten 100 percent humid. So this device can extract\nall the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on Mars. Next we have to worry\nabout what we will breathe. Frankly, I was really shocked to fd"
2076,0.0," out that \nhas this problem worked out. This is a scientist at MIT\nnamed Michael Hecht. And he\'s developed this mache, Moxie. I love this thg. It\'s a reverse fuel cell, essentially, that sucks  the Martian atmosphere\n pumps out oxygen. And you have to remember that CO2  carbon dioxide, which is\n96 percent  Mars\' atmosphere  CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen. Now, the next big rover\nthat  sends to Mars  2020 is gog to have one\n these devices aboard,  it will be able\nto produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive defitely. But the secret to this   that\'s just for testg  the secret to this is that this thg\nwas designed from the getgo to be scalable by a factor  100. Next, what will we eat? Well, we\'ll use hydroponics to grow food, but we\'re not gog to be able to grow more than 15 to 20 percent\n our food there, at least not until water is runng\non the surface  Mars  we actually have the probability\n the capability  plantg crops. In the meantime, most  our food will arr"

But this really only works\ndurg the daytime. re is too much solar radiation\n too much radiation from cosmic rays. So we really have to go underground. Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars, by  large,\nis perfect for makg bricks. And  has figured this one out, too. y\'re gog to throw\nsome polymer plastic to the bricks, shove them  a microwave oven,  then you will be able to build\nbuildgs with really thick walls. Or we may choose to live underground\n caves or  lava tubes,  which there are plenty. And fally there\'s clothg. On Earth we have miles\n atmosphere piled up on us, which creates 15 pounds  pressure\non our bodies at all times,  we\'re constantly\npushg out agast that. On Mars there\'s hardly\nany atmospheric pressure. So Dava Newman, a scientist at MIT, has created this sleek space suit. It will keep us together, block radia"

So that leads to the next big  really big step   livg the good life on Mars. And that\'s terraformg the planet: makg it more like Earth, reengeerg an entire planet. That sounds like a lot  hubris, but the truth is that the technology to do everythg\nI\'m about to tell you already exists. First we\'ve got to warm it up. Mars is credibly cold\nbecause it has a very th atmosphere.  answer lies here, at the south pole\n at the north pole  Mars, both  which are covered with an credible amount\n frozen carbon dioxide  dry ice. If we heat it up, it sublimes directly to the atmosphere  thickens the atmosphere\nthe same way it does on Earth. And as we know, CO2 is an credibly\npotent greenhouse gas. Now, my favorite way  dog this\nis to erect a very, very large solar sail  focus it  it essentially serves as a "
2079,0.0,"mirror   focus it on the south pole\n Mars at first. As the planet sps, it will heat up\nall that dry ice, sublime it,  it will go to the atmosphere. It actually won\'t take long for the temperature\non Mars to start risg, probably less than 20 years. Right now, on a perfect day at the equator,  the middle  summer on Mars, temperatures can\nactually reach 70 degrees, but then they go down\nto mus 100 at night. () What we\'re shootg for\nis a runaway greenhouse effect: enough temperature rise\nto see a lot  that ice on Mars  especially the ice  the ground  melt. n we get some real magic. As the atmosphere gets thicker,\neverythg gets better. We get more protection from radiation, more atmosphere makes us warmer,\nmakes the planet warmer, so we get runng water  that makes crops possible. n more water vapor goes to the air,\nformg yet another potent greenhouse gas. It will ra  it will snow on Mars. And a thicker atmosphere\nwill create enough pressure so that we can\nthrow away those spac"
2080,0.0,"e suits. We only need about five pounds\n pressure to survive. Eventually, Mars will be made\nto feel a lot like British Columbia. We\'ll still be left\nwith the complicated problem  makg the atmosphere breathable,  frankly that could take\n1,000 years to accomplish. But humans are amazgly smart\n credibly adaptable. re is no tellg what our future\ntechnology will be able to accomplish  no tellg what we can do\nwith our own bodies. In biology right now, we are on the very verge  beg\nable to control our own genetics, what the genes\n our own bodies are dog,  certaly, eventually, our own evolution. We could end up with a species\n human beg on Earth that is slightly different\nfrom the species  human begs on Mars. But what would you do there?\nHow would you live? It\'s gog to be\nthe same as it is on Earth. Somebody\'s gog to start a restaurant, somebody\'s gog to build an iron foundry. Someone will make\ndocumentary movies  Mars  sell them on Earth.

2082,0.0,"Translator: Jenny Zurawell A few months ago the Nobel Prize  physics was awarded to two teams  astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one  the most important astronomical observations ever. And today, after briefly describg what they found, I\'m gog to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explag their discovery, namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth, the Milky Way  other distant galaxies, we may fd that our universe is not the only universe, but is stead part  a vast complex  universes that we call the multiverse. Now the idea  a multiverse is a strange one. I mean, most  us were raised to believe that the word ""universe"" means everythg. And I say most  us with forethought, as my fouryearold daughter has heard me speak  these ideas sce she was born. And last year I was holdg her  I said, ""Sophia, I love you more than anythg  the universe."" And she turned to me  said, ""Daddy, universe or multiverse?"" () But barrg such an anomalous upbrgg, it is str"
2083,0.0,"ange to image other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes  their own. And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convce you that there\'s reason for takg it seriously, as it just might be right. I\'m gog to tell the story  the multiverse  three parts. In part one, I\'m gog to describe those Nobel Prizewng results  to highlight a pround mystery which those results revealed. In part two, I\'ll fer a solution to that mystery. It\'s based on an approach called strg theory,  that\'s where the idea  the multiverse will come to the story. Fally,  part three, I\'m gog to describe a cosmological theory called flation, which will pull all the pieces  the story together. Okay, part one starts back  1929 when the great astronomer Edw Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushg away from us, establishg that space itself is stretchg, it\'s expg. Now this was revolutionary.  prevailg wisdom was that on "
2084,0.0,"the largest  scales the universe was static. But even so, there was one thg that everyone was certa :  expansion must be slowg down. That, much as the gravitational pull  the Earth slows the ascent  an apple tossed upward, the gravitational pull  each galaxy on every other must be slowg the expansion  space. Now let\'s fastforward to the 1990s when those two teams  astronomers I mentioned at the outset were spired by this reasong to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowg. And they did this by pastakg observations  numerous distant galaxies, allowg them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here\'s the surprise: y found that the expansion is not slowg down. Instead they found that it\'s speedg up, gog faster  faster. That\'s like tossg an apple upward  it goes up faster  faster. Now if you saw an apple do that, you\'d want to know why. What\'s pushg on it? Similarly, the astronomers\' results are surely welldeservg  the Nobel Prize, but they raised an an"
2085,0.0,"alogous question. What force is drivg all galaxies to rush away from every other at an everquickeng speed? Well the most promisg answer comes from an old idea  Este\'s. You see, we are all used to gravity beg a force that does one thg, pulls objects together. But  Este\'s theory  gravity, his general theory  relativity, gravity can also push thgs apart. How? Well accordg to Este\'s math, if space is uniformly filled with an visible energy, sort  like a uniform, visible mist, then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive, repulsive gravity, which is just what we need to expla the observations. Because the repulsive gravity  an visible energy  space  we now call it dark energy, but I\'ve made it smokey white here so you can see it  its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push agast every other, drivg expansion to speed up, not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress. But I promised you a mystery here  part one. Here it is. When the astronomers work"
2086,0.0,"ed out how much  this dark energy must be fusg space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed  the relevant unit, it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to expla this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws  physics, but so far no one has found a way to do that. Now you might wonder, should you care? Maybe explag this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail  terest to experts, but  no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter. Some details provide wdows to uncharted realms  reality,  this peculiar number may be dog just that, as the only approach that\'s so far made headway to expla it vokes the possibility  other universes  an idea that naturally emerges from strg theory, which takes me to part two: strg theory. So hold the mystery  the dark energy  the back  your md as I now go on to tell you three key thgs about strg theory. First f, what"
2087,0.0," is it? Well it\'s an approach to realize Este\'s dream  a unified theory  physics, a sgle overarchg framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work  the universe. And the central idea  strg theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you exame any piece  matter ever more fely, at first you\'ll fd molecules  then you\'ll fd atoms  subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller, much smaller than we can with existg technology, you\'d fd somethg else side these particles  a little ty vibratg filament  energy, a little ty vibratg strg. And just like the strgs on a viol, they can vibrate  different patterns producg different al notes. se little fundamental strgs, when they vibrate  different patterns, they produce different kds  particles  so electrons, quarks, neutros, photons, all other particles would be united to a sgle framework, as they would all arise from vibratg strgs. It\'s a compellg picture, a kd  cosmic symphony, where all the ric"
2088,0.0,"hness that we see  the world around us emerges from the  that these little, ty strgs can play. But there\'s a cost to this elegant unification, because years  research have shown that the math  strg theory doesn\'t quite work. It has ternal consistencies, unless we allow for somethg wholly unfamiliar  extra dimensions  space. That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions  space. And you can thk about those as height, width  depth. But strg theory says that, on fantastically small scales, there are additional dimensions crumpled to a ty size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden, they would have an impact on thgs that we can observe because the shape  the extra dimensions constras how the strgs can vibrate. And  strg theory, vibration determes everythg. So particle masses, the strengths  forces,  most importantly, the amount  dark energy would be determed by the shape  the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape  the extra dimension"
2089,0.0,"s, we should be able to calculate these features, calculate the amount  dark energy.  challenge is we don\'t know the shape  the extra dimensions. l we have is a list  cidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed, there were only about five different cidate shapes, so you can image analyzg them onebyone to determe if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other cidate shapes. From five, the number grew to the hundreds  then the thouss  A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze, sce after all, graduate students need somethg to do. But then the list contued to grow to the millions  the billions, until today.  list  cidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500. So, what to do? Well some researchers lost heart, concludg that was so many cidate shapes for the extra dimensions, each givg rise to different physical features, strg theory would never make defitive, testable predictions. But other"
2090,0.0,"s turned this issue on its head, takg us to the possibility  a multiverse. Here\'s the idea. Maybe each  these shapes is on an equal footg with every other. Each is as real as every other,  the sense that there are many universes, each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a pround impact on this mystery: the amount  dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prizewng results. Because you see, if there are other universes,  if those universes each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions, then the physical features  each universe will be different,   particular, the amount  dark energy  each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery  explag the amount  dark energy we\'ve now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context, the laws  physics can\'t expla one number for the dark energy because there isn\'t just one number, there are many numbers. Which means we have been askg the wrong question. It\'s that "
2091,0.0,"the right question to ask is, why do we humans fd ourselves  a universe with a particular amount  dark energy we\'ve measured stead  any  the other possibilities that are out there? And that\'s a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours, whenever matter tries to clump to galaxies, the repulsive push  the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart  galaxies don\'t form. And  those universes that have much less dark energy, well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that, aga, galaxies don\'t form. And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets  no chance for our form  life to exist  those other universes. So we fd ourselves  a universe with the particular amount  dark energy we\'ve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form  life. And that would be that. Mystery solved, multiverse found. Now some fd this explanation unsatisfyg. We\'re used to physics givg us defitive e"
2092,0.0,"xplanations for the features we observe. But the pot is, if the feature you\'re observg can  does take on a wide variety  different values across the wider lscape  reality, then thkg one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understg a different number  why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades tryg to expla this number, but he never succeeded,  we know why. Kepler was askg the wrong question. We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety  different distances from their host stars. So hopg that the laws  physics will expla one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is, why do we humans fd ourselves on a planet at this particular distance, stead  any  the other possibilities? And aga, that\'s a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the"
2093,0.0," Sun would be so hot that our form  life wouldn\'t exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they\'re so cold that, aga, our form  life would not take hold. So we fd ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form  life. And when it comes to planets  their distances, this clearly is the right kd  reasong.  pot is, when it comes to universes  the dark energy that they conta, it may also be the right kd  reasong. One key difference,  course, is we know that there are other planets out there, but so far I\'ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together, we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my fal part, part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists tryg to underst the  Bang. You see, when we speak  the  Bang, we ten have an image  a kd  cosmic explosion that created our universe  se"
2094,0.0,"t space rushg outward. But there\'s a little secret.   Bang leaves out somethg pretty important, the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no sight to what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was fally filled by an enhanced version  the  Bang theory. It\'s called flationary cosmology, which identified a particular kd  fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush  space.  fuel is based on somethg called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it\'s virtually impossible to use it all up, which means  the flationary theory, the  Bang givg rise to our universe is likely not a onetime event. Instead the fuel not only generated our  Bang, but it would also generate countless other  Bangs, each givg rise to its own separate universe with our universe becomg but one bubble  a gr cosmic bubble bath  universes. And now, when we meld this with strg theory, here\'s the picture we\"
2095,0.0,"'re led to. Each  these universes has extra dimensions.  extra dimensions take on a wide variety  different shapes.  different shapes yield different physical features. And we fd ourselves  one universe stead  another simply because it\'s only  our universe that the physical features, like the amount  dark energy, are right for our form  life to take hold. And this is the compellg but highly controversial picture  the wider cosmos that cuttgedge observation  theory have now led us to seriously consider. One big remag question,  course, is, could we ever confirm the existence  other universes? Well let me describe one way that might one day happen.  flationary theory already has strong observational support.

And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern  temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded  observations, establishg the existence  other universes. I\'ll conclude with a strikg implication  all these ideas for the very far future. You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expg, that that expansion is speedg up  that there might be other universes all by carefully examg fat ppots  starlight comg to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speedg up,  the very far future, those galaxies will rush away so far  so fast that we won\'t be able to see them  not because  technological limitations, but because  the laws  physics.  light those galaxies emit"

So astronomers  the far future lookg out to deep space will see nothg but an endless stretch  static, ky, black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static  unchangg  populated by a sgle central oasis  matter that they habit  a picture  the cosmos that we defitively know to be wrong. Now maybe those future astronomers will have records hed down from an earlier era, like ours, attestg to an expg cosmos teemg with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge? Or would they believe  the black, static empty universe that their own statetheart observations reveal? I suspect the latter. Which means that we are livg through a remarkably privileged era when certa deep truths about the cosmos are still with reach  the human spirit  exploration.

2100,0.0,"What I\'d like to do today is talk\nabout one  my favorite subjects,  that is the neuroscience  sleep. Now, there is a sound  (arm clock) Ah, it worked! A sound that is desperately\nfamiliar to most  us,   course it\'s the sound\n the alarm clock. And what that  ghastly,\nawful sound does is stop the sgle most important\nbehavioral experience that we have,  that\'s sleep. If you\'re an average sort  person, 36 percent  your life\nwill be spent asleep, which means that if you live to 90, then 32 years will have\nbeen spent entirely asleep. Now what that 32 years is tellg us\nis that sleep at some level is important. And yet, for most  us,\nwe don\'t give sleep a second thought. We throw it away. We really just don\'t thk about sleep. And so what I\'d like to do today\nis change your views, change your ideas\n your thoughts about sleep. And the journey\nthat I want to take you on, we need to start by gog back  time. ""Enjoy the honeyheavy dew  slumber."" Any ideas who said that? Shakespear"
2101,0.0,"e\'s Julius Caesar. Yes, let me give you a few more quotes. ""O sleep, O gentle sleep,\nnature\'s st nurse, how have I frighted thee?"" Shakespeare aga, from \nI won\'t say it  the Scottish play. () From the same time: ""Sleep is the golden cha\nthat ties health  our bodies together."" Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,\nanother Elizabethan dramatist. But if we jump forward 00 years, the tone about sleep changes somewhat. This is from Thomas Edison,\nfrom the begng  the 20th century: ""Sleep is a crimal waste  time\n a heritage from our cave days."" Bang! () And if we also jump to the 1980s,\nsome  you may remember that Margaret Thatcher\nwas reported to have said, ""Sleep is for wimps."" And  course the famous \nwhat was his name?  the famous Gordon Gekko\nfrom "" "" said, ""Money never sleeps."" What do we do  the 20th\ncentury about sleep? Well,  course, we use\nThomas Edison\'s light bulb to vade the night,\n we occupied the dark,   the process  this occupation, we\'ve treated sleep as an "
2102,0.0,"illness, almost. We\'ve treated it as an enemy. At most now, I suppose,\nwe tolerate the need for sleep,  at worst perhaps\nmany  us thk  sleep as an illness that needs\nsome sort  a cure. And our ignorance about sleep\nis really quite pround. Why is it? Why do we abon\nsleep  our thoughts? Well, it\'s because you don\'t do anythg\nmuch while you\'re asleep, it seems. You don\'t eat. You don\'t drk. And you don\'t have sex. Well, most  us anyway. And so, therefore it\'s  Sorry. It\'s a complete waste  time, right? Wrong. Actually, sleep is an credibly\nimportant part  our biology,  neuroscientists\nare begng to expla why it\'s so very important. So let\'s move to the bra. Now, here we have a bra. This is donated by a social scientist,  they said they didn\'t know what\nit was or deed, how to use it, so  () Sorry. So I borrowed it. I don\'t thk they noticed. OK. ()  pot I\'m tryg to make\nis that when you\'re asleep, this thg doesn\'t shut down. In fact, some areas  the bra\nare actuall"
2103,0.0,"y more active durg the sleep state\nthan durg the wake state.  other thg that\'s really\nimportant about sleep is that it doesn\'t arise from a sgle\nstructure with the bra, but is to some extent a network property. If we flip the bra on its back  I love this little bit\n spal cord here  this bit here is the hypothalamus,  right under there is a whole raft\n terestg structures, not least the biological clock.  biological clock tells us\nwhen it\'s good to be up, when it\'s good to be asleep,  what that structure does is teract with a whole raft  other areas\nwith the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus,\nthe ventrolateral preoptic nuclei. l  those combe,  they send projections\ndown to the bra stem here.  bra stem then projects forward  bathes the cortex,\nthis wonderfully wrkly bit over here, with neurotransmitters that keep us awake  essentially provide us\nwith our consciousness. So sleep arises from a whole raft  different teractions\nwith the bra,  essentially,\nsleep is turned"
2104,0.0," on  f as a result  a range\n teractions  here. OK. So where have we got to? We\'ve said that sleep is complicated  it takes 32 years  our life. But what I haven\'t explaed\nis what sleep is about. So why do we sleep? And it won\'t surprise\nany  you that,  course, as scientists, we don\'t have a consensus. re are dozens  different ideas\nabout why we sleep,  I\'m gog to outle three  those.  first is sort  the restoration idea,  it\'s somewhat tuitive. Essentially, all the stuff\nwe\'ve burned up durg the day, we restore, we replace,\nwe rebuild durg the night. And deed, as an explanation,\nit goes back to Aristotle, so that\'s what  2,300 years ago. It\'s gone   out  fashion. It\'s fashionable at the moment because what\'s been shown\nis that with the bra, a whole raft  genes have been shown\nto be turned on only durg sleep,  those genes are associated\nwith restoration  metabolic pathways. So there\'s good evidence\nfor the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation"
2105,0.0,"? Aga, perhaps tuitive. You essentially sleep to save calories. Now, when you do the sums,\nthough, it doesn\'t really pan out. If you compare an dividual\nwho has slept at night, or stayed awake\n hasn\'t moved very much, the energy savg  sleepg\nis about 110 calories a night. Now, that\'s the equivalent\n a hot dog bun. Now, I would say that a hot dog bun is kd  a meager return for such a complicated\n demg behavior as sleep. So I\'m less convced\nby the energy conservation idea. But the third idea I\'m quite attracted to, which is bra processg\n memory consolidation. What we know is that,\nif after you\'ve tried to learn a task,  you sleepdeprive dividuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed. It\'s really hugely attenuated. So sleep  memory consolidation\nis also very important. However, it\'s not just\nthe layg down  memory  recallg it. What\'s turned out to be really excitg is that our ability to come up\nwith novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a nigh"
2106,0.0,"t  sleep. In fact, it\'s been estimated\nto give us a threefold advantage. Sleepg at night enhances our creativity. And what seems to be gog on\nis that,  the bra, those neural connections\nthat are important, those synaptic connections\nthat are important, are lked  strengthened, while those that are less important\ntend to fade away  be less important. OK. So we\'ve had three explanations\nfor why we might sleep,  I thk the important thg to realize\nis that the details will vary,  it\'s probable we sleep\nfor multiple different reasons. But sleep is not an dulgence. It\'s not some sort  thg that we can\ntake on board rather casually. I thk that sleep was once\nlikened to an upgrade from economy to busess class,\nyou know, the equivalent . It\'s not even an upgrade\nfrom economy to first class.  critical thg to realize is that\nif you don\'t sleep, you don\'t fly. Essentially, you never get there. And what\'s extraordary\nabout much  our society these days is that we are desperately s"
2107,0.0,"leepdeprived. So let\'s now look at sleep deprivation. Huge sectors  society\nare sleepdeprived,  let\'s look at our sleepometer. So  the 1950s, good data\nsuggests that most  us were gettg around eight hours\n sleep a night. Nowadays, we sleep one  a half\nto two hours less every night, so we\'re  the sixahalfhours\neverynight league. For teenagers, it\'s worse, much worse. y need ne hours\nfor full bra performance,  many  them, on a school night,\nare only gettg five hours  sleep. It\'s simply not enough. If we thk about other sectors\n society  the aged; if you are aged, then your ability\nto sleep  a sgle block is somewhat disrupted,\n many sleep, aga, less than five hours a night. Shift work. Shift work is extraordary, perhaps 20 percent\n the workg population,  the body clock does not shift\nto the dems  workg at night. It\'s locked onto the same\nlightdark cycle as the rest  us. So when the poor old\nshift worker is gog home to try  sleep durg the day,\ndesperately tired, the bo"
2108,0.0,"dy clock is sayg,\n""Wake up. This is the time to be awake."" So the quality  sleep\nthat you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor,\naga  that sort  fivehour region. And then,  course, tens  millions\n people suffer from jet lag. So who here has jet lag? Well, my goodness gracious. Well, thank you very much\ndeed for not fallg asleep, because that\'s what your bra is cravg. One  the thgs that the bra does\nis dulge  microsleeps, this voluntary fallg asleep,  you have essentially\nno control over it. Now, microsleeps can be sort\n somewhat embarrassg, but they can also be deadly. It\'s been estimated\nthat 31 percent  drivers will fall asleep at the wheel\nat least once  their life,   the US, the statistics\nare pretty good: 100,000 accidents on the freeway\nhave been associated with tiredness, loss  vigilance,  fallg asleep \na hundred thous a year. It\'s extraordary. At another level  terror, we dip to the tragic\naccidents at Chernobyl  deed the space shuttle Challenger, wh"
2109,0.0,"ich was so tragically lost. And  the vestigations\nthat followed those disasters, poor judgment as a result\n extended shift work  loss  vigilance  tiredness was attributed to a big chunk\n those disasters. When you\'re tired  you lack sleep, you have poor memory,\nyou have poor creativity, you have creased impulsiveness,  you have overall poor judgment. But my friends,\nit\'s so much worse than that. () If you are a tired bra, the bra is cravg thgs to wake it up. So drugs, stimulants. Caffee represents\nthe stimulant  choice across much  the Western world. Much  the day is fueled by caffee,  if you\'re a really naughty\ntired bra, nicote. Of course, you\'re fuelg the wakg state\nwith these stimulants,  then,  course, it gets\nto 11 o\'clock at night,  the bra says to itself, ""Actually, I need\nto be asleep fairly shortly. What do we do about that\nwhen I\'m feelg completely wired?"" Well,  course,\nyou then resort to alcohol. Now alcohol, shortterm,\nyou know, once or twice, to use to "
2110,0.0,"mildly sedate you,\ncan be very useful. It can actually ease the sleep transition. But what you must be so aware \nis that alcohol doesn\'t provide sleep. A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you. So it actually harms\nsome  the neural processg that\'s gog on durg memory\nconsolidation  memory recall. So it\'s a shortterm acute measure, but for goodness sake, don\'t become addicted to alcohol as a way  gettg to sleep every night. Another connection\nbetween loss  sleep is weight ga. If you sleep around\nabout five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percent\nlikelihood  beg obese. What\'s the connection here? Well, sleep loss seems to give rise\nto the release  the hormone ghrel, the hunger hormone. Ghrel is released. It gets to the bra.  bra says, ""I need carbohydrates,""  what it does is seek out carbohydrates\n particularly sugars. So there\'s a lk between tiredness  the metabolic predisposition\nfor weight ga: stress. Tired people are massively stressed. And one  the t"
2111,0.0,"hgs  stress,\n course, is loss  memory, which is what I sort  just then\nhad a little lapse . But stress is so much more. So, if you\'re acutely stressed,\nnot a great problem, but it\'s sustaed stress associated\nwith sleep loss that\'s the problem. Sustaed stress leads\nto suppressed immunity. And so, tired people tend to have\nhigher rates  overall fection,  there\'s some very good studies showg that shift workers, for example,\nhave higher rates  cancer. Increased levels  stress\nthrow glucose to the circulation. Glucose becomes a domant part\n the vasculature  essentially you become\nglucose tolerant. refore, diabetes 2. Stress creases cardiovascular disease\nas a result  raisg blood pressure. So there\'s a whole raft  thgs\nassociated with sleep loss that are more than just\na mildly impaired bra, which is where I thk most people thk\nthat sleep loss resides. So at this pot  the talk,\nthis is a nice time to thk, ""Well, do you thk on the whole\nI\'m gettg enough sleep?"" So a quic"
2112,0.0,"k show  hs. Who feels that they\'re gettg\nenough sleep here? Oh. Well, that\'s pretty impressive. Good. We\'ll talk more about that later,\nabout what are your tips. So most  us,  course,\nask the question, ""How do I know whether\nI\'m gettg enough sleep?"" Well, it\'s not rocket science. If you need an alarm clock to get\nyou out  bed  the morng, if you are takg a long time to get up, if you need lots  stimulants, if you\'re grumpy, if you\'re irritable, if you\'re told by your work colleagues\nthat you\'re lookg tired  irritable, chances are you are sleepdeprived. Listen to them. Listen to yourself. What do you do? Well   this is slightly fensive  sleep for dummies. () Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.  first critical thg is make it\nas dark as you possibly can,  also make it slightly cool. Very important. Actually, reduce your amount\n light exposure at least half an hour\nbefore you go to bed. Light creases levels  alertness\n will delay sleep. What\'s the last thg that most  us"
2113,0.0,"\ndo before we go to bed? We st  a massively lit bathroom, lookg to the mirror\ncleang our teeth. It\'s the worst thg we can possibly do\nbefore we go to sleep. Turn f those mobile phones.\nTurn f those computers. Turn f all  those thgs\nthat are also gog to excite the bra. Try not to drk caffee\ntoo late  the day, ideally not after lunch. Now, we\'ve set about reducg light\nexposure before you go to bed, but light exposure  the morng is very good at settg the biological\nclock to the lightdark cycle. So seek out morng light.

In my experience, the only difference between morng\npeople  eveng people is that those people that get up\n the morng early are just horribly smug. () () OK. So for the last few mutes, what I want to do is change gears  talk about some really new,\nbreakg areas  neuroscience, which is the association\nbetween mental health, mental illness  sleep disruption. We\'ve known for 130 years\nthat  severe mental illness, there is always, always sleep disruption, but it\'s been largely ignored. In the 1970s, when peopl"
2115,0.0,"e started\nto thk about this aga, they said, ""Yes, well,  course you have\nsleep disruption  schizophrenia, because they\'re on antipsychotics. It\'s the antipsychotics causg\nthe sleep problems,"" ignorg the fact that\nfor a hundred years previously, sleep disruption had been reported\nbefore antipsychotics. So what\'s gog on? Several groups are studyg conditions like depression,\nschizophrenia  bipolar  what\'s gog on\n terms  sleep disruption. We have a big study which we published\nlast year on schizophrenia,  the data were quite extraordary. In those dividuals with schizophrenia, much  the time, they were awake\ndurg the night phase  then they were asleep durg the day. Other groups showed no 2hour\npatterns whatsoever  their sleep was absolutely smashed. And some had no ability to regulate\ntheir sleep by the lightdark cycle. y were gettg up later  later\n later  later each night. It was smashed. So what\'s gog on? And the really excitg news is that mental illness  sleep\nare not s"
2116,0.0,"imply associated, but they are physically lked\nwith the bra.  neural networks that predispose\nyou to normal sleep, give you normal sleep,  those that give you normal\nmental health, are overlappg. And what\'s the evidence for that? Well, genes that have been shown to be very important\n the generation  normal sleep, when mutated, when changed, also predispose dividuals\nto mental health problems. And last year, we published a study which showed that a gene\nthat\'s been lked to schizophrenia, when mutated, also smashes the sleep. So we have evidence\n a genue mechanistic overlap between these two important systems. Other work flowed from these studies.  first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certa types\n mental illness,  we\'ve shown that\n those young dividuals who are at high risk\n developg bipolar disorder, they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clical\ndiagnosis  bipolar.  other bit  data\nwas that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate, make worse,\nth"

We\'ve got,  these connections,\nsome really excitg thgs. In terms  the neuroscience, by understg these two systems, we\'re really begng to underst\nhow both sleep  mental illness are generated  regulated\nwith the bra.  second area\nis that if we can use sleep  sleep disruption\nas an early warng signal, then we have the chance  gog . If we know these dividuals\nare vulnerable, early tervention then becomes possible. And the third, which I thk\nis the most excitg, is that we can thk\n the sleep centers with the bra as a new therapeutic target. Stabilize sleep  those dividuals\nwho are vulnerable, we can certaly make them healthier, but also alleviate some  the appallg\nsymptoms  mental illness. So let me just fish. What I started by sayg is:\nTake sleep seriously. Our attitudes toward sleep\nare so very d"

If you could take all  the ozone, which is mostly about\n10 to 20 miles up above our heads,  compress it down\nto the surface  the earth, it would form a th shell\nonly about two pennies thick, about an eighth  an ch. And that th shell does\nan amazg amount  work, though. It filters out more than 90 percent\n the harmful UV radiation comg from the sun.

And actually, ironically,\nit was human safety that motivated the vention\n CFCs  the first place.

For good reason,\nthe refrigeration dustry wanted a safe alternative,  they found that  1928, when a scientist named Thomas Midgley synthesized the first\ncommercially viable CFCs.

But really, at the time, CFCs were a really remarkable vention. y allowed what we now know\nas modernday refrigeration  airconditiong  other thgs.

It led, ultimately, to the banng\n CFC usage  aerosol spray cans  the US  a few\nother countries  1978. Now, the story doesn't end there, because CFCs were used\n much more than just spray cans. In 1985, scientists discovered\nthe Antarctic ozone hole,  this was a  alarmg discovery. Scientists did not expect this at all. Before the Antarctic ozone hole, scientists expected\nmaybe a five or 10 percent reduction  ozone over a century. But what they found\nover the course  less than a decade was that more than a third  the ozone\nhad simply vanished, over an area larger\nthan the size  the US. And although we now know that CFCs\nare the root cause  this ozone hole, at the time, the science\nwas far from settled. Yet despite this uncertaty, the crisis helped spur nations to act. So that quote that I started\nthis talk with, about the Montreal Protocol,\nfrom President Reagan  tha"
2123,0.0,"t was his signg statement\nwhen he signed the Montreal Protocol after its unanimous ratification\nby the US Senate. And this is somethg\nthat's  worth celebratg. In fact, yesterday was the 30th\nanniversary  the Montreal Protocol. () Because  the protocol, ozonedepletg substances\nare now declg  our atmosphere,  we're startg to see the first signs\n healg  the ozone layer. And furthermore, because many\n those ozonedepletg substances are also very potent greenhouse gases, the Montreal Protocol\nhas actually delayed global warmg by more than a decade. That's just wonderful. But I thk it's worth\naskg the question, as we face our current\nenvironmental crisis, global warmg, what lessons can we learn from Montreal? Are there any? I thk there are. First, we don't need\nabsolute certaty to act. When Montreal was signed, we were less certa then\n the risks from CFCs than we are now  the risks\nfrom greenhouse gas emissions. A common tactic that people\nwho oppose climate action use is to com"

And so ask yourself, did you wear your seat belt\nbecause someone told you with a hundred percent [certaty] that you would get\n a car crash on the way here? Probably not. So that's the first lesson. Risk management  decision makg\nalways have uncertaty. Ignorg risk  focusg\nonly on uncertaty is a distraction. In other words, action is an action. Second, it takes a village\nto raise a healthy environment.  Montreal Protocol wasn't just\nput together by dustry  governments or environmental advocacy\ngroups  scientists. It was put together by all  them. y all had a seat at the table,  they all played\nan important role  the solution. And I thk  this regard, we're actually seeg\nsome encouragg signs today. We see not just environmental groups\nconcer"

So wherever you fd yourself\non that spectrum, we need you at the table, because if we're gog\nto solve global warmg, it's gog to take actions at all levels, from the dividual to the ternational  everythg  between. Third lesson: don't let the perfect\nbe the enemy  the good. While Montreal has become the brake pedal\nfor stoppg ozone depletion, at its begng, it was more\njust like a tap on the brakes. It was actually the later\namendments to the protocol that really marked the decision\nto hit the brakes on ozone depletion. So to those who despair that the Paris Climate Accord\ndidn't go far enough or that your limited actions on their own\nwon't solve global warmg, I say don't let the perfect\nbe the enemy  the good.

And we have environments where we have months  humidity followed by months  dryness,  that is where desertification is occurrg. Fortunately, with space technology now, we can look at it from space,  when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well. Generally, what you see  green is not desertifyg,  what you see  brown is,  these are by far the greatest areas  the Earth. About two thirds, I would guess,  the world is desertifyg. I took this picture  the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters  that\'s an ch  ra  was fallg.   it  terms  drums  water, each contag 200 liters. Over 1,000 drums  water fell on every hectare  that l that day.  next day, the l looked like this. Where had that water gone? Some  it ran f as floodg, but most  the water that soaked to the soil simply evaporated out aga, exactly as it does  your garden if you leave t"
2157,0.0,"he soil uncovered. Now, because the fate  water  carbon are tied to soil organic matter, when we damage soils, you give f carbon. Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. Now you\'re told over  over, repeatedly, that desertification is only occurrg  arid  semiarid areas  the world,  that tall grassls like this one  high rafall are  no consequence. But if you do not look at grassls but look down to them, you fd that most  the soil  that grassl that you\'ve just seen is bare  covered with a crust  algae, leadg to creased runf  evaporation. That is the cancer  desertification that we do not recognize till its termal form. Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock, mostly cattle, sheep  goats, overgrazg the plants, leavg the soil bare  givg f methane. most everybody knows this, from nobel laureates to golf caddies, or was taught it, as I was. Now, the environments like you see here, dusty environments  Africa where I grew up,  I loved wildlife,  so I grew up hatg livestock because"

We were wrong then,  we are wrong aga. And I want to vite you now to come along on my journey  reeducation  discovery. When I was a young man, a young biologist  Africa, I was volved  settg aside marvelous areas as future national parks. Now no sooner — this was  the 1950s —  no sooner did we remove the huntg, drumbeatg people to protect the animals, than the l began to deteriorate, as you see  this park that we formed. Now, no livestock were volved, but suspectg that we had too many elephants now, I did the research  I proved we had too many,  I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers  brg them down to a level that the l could susta. Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,  it was political dynamite, frankly. So our government formed a team  experts to evaluate my research. y di"
2159,0.0,"d. y agreed with me,  over the followg years, we shot 0,000 elephants to try to stop the damage. And it got worse, not better. Lovg elephants as I do, that was the saddest  greatest blunder  my life,  I will carry that to my grave. One good thg did come out  it. It made me absolutely determed to devote my life to fdg solutions. When I came to the United States, I got a shock, to fd national parks like this one desertifyg as badly as anythg  Africa. And there\'d been no livestock on this l for over 70 years. And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid  natural. So I then began lookg at all the research plots I could over the whole  the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification, but I found the opposite, as we see on this research station, where this grassl that was green  1961, by 2002 had changed to that situation. And the authors  the position paper on climate change from which I obtaed t"
2160,0.0,"hese pictures attribute this change to ""unknown processes."" Clearly, we have never understood what is causg desertification, which has destroyed many civilizations  now threatens us globally. We have never understood it. Take one square meter  soil  make it bare like this is down here,  I promise you, you will fd it much colder at dawn  much hotter at midday than that same piece  ground if it\'s just covered with litter, plant litter. You have changed the microclimate. Now, by the time you are dog that  creasg greatly the percentage  bare ground on more than half the world\'s l, you are changg macroclimate. But we have just simply not understood why was it begng to happen 10,000 years ago? Why has it accelerated lately? We had no understg  that. What we had failed to underst was that these seasonal humidity environments  the world, the soil  the vegetation developed with very large numbers  grazg animals,  that these grazg animals developed with ferocious packhuntg predators. Now, the "
2161,0.0,"ma defense agast packhuntg predators is to get to herds,  the larger the herd, the safer the dividuals. Now, large herds dung  urate all over their own food,  they have to keep movg,  it was that movement that prevented the overgrazg  plants, while the periodic tramplg ensured good cover  the soil, as we see where a herd has passed. This picture is a typical seasonal grassl. It has just come through four months  ra,  it\'s now gog to eight months  dry season. And watch the change as it goes to this long dry season. Now, all  that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growg season,  if it doesn\'t, the grassl  the soil beg to die. Now, if it does not decay biologically, it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,  this smothers  kills grasses, leadg to a shift to woody vegetation  bare soil, releasg carbon. To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire. But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasg carbon,  worse than that, burng one hectare  gra"
2162,0.0,"ssl gives f more,  more damagg, pollutants than 6,000 cars. And we are burng  Africa, every sgle year, more than one billion hectares  grassls,  almost nobody is talkg about it. We justify the burng, as scientists, because it does remove the dead material  it allows the plants to grow. Now, lookg at this grassl  ours that has gone dry, what could we do to keep that healthy? And bear  md, I\'m talkg  most  the world\'s l now. Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causg desertification  climate change. We cannot burn it without causg desertification  climate change. What are we gog to do? re is only one option, I\'ll repeat to you, only one option left to climatologists  scientists,  that is to do the unthkable,  to use livestock, bunched  movg, as a proxy for former herds  predators,  mimic nature. re is no other alternative left to mankd. So let\'s do that. So on this bit  grassl, we\'ll do it, but just  the foreground. We\'ll impact it very heavily with cattle "
2163,0.0,"to mimic nature,  we\'ve done so,  look at that. l  that grass is now coverg the soil as dung, ure  litter or mulch, as every one  the gardeners amongst you would underst,  that soil is ready to absorb  hold the ra, to store carbon,  to break down methane. And we did that, without usg fire to damage the soil,  the plants are free to grow. When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use muchvilified livestock to address climate change  desertification, I was faced with a real dilemma. How were we to do it? We\'d had 10,000 years  extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunchg  movg their animals, but they had created the great manmade deserts  the world. n we\'d had 100 years  modern ra science,  that had accelerated desertification, as we first discovered  Africa  then confirmed  the United States,  as you see  this picture  l managed by the federal government. Clearly more was needed than bunchg  movg the animals,  humans, over thouss  years, had never been able to d"

So rather than revent the wheel, I began studyg other pressions to see if anybody had. And I found there were planng techniques that I could take  adapt to our biological need,  from those I developed what we call holistic management  planned grazg, a planng process,  that does address all  nature\'s complexity  our social, environmental, economic complexity. Today, we have young women like this one teachg villages  Africa how to put their animals together to larger herds, plan their grazg to mimic nature,  where we have them hold their animals overnight  we run them  a predatorfriendly manner, because we have a lot  ls,  so on   where they do this  hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields, we are gettg very great creases  crop yield as well.

But as you can see, all  that ra, almost  all it, has evaporated from the soil surface. ir river is dry despite the ra just havg ended,  we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid.

But before we began, our l looked like that. This site was bare  erodg for over 30 years regardless  what ra we got. Okay? Watch the marked tree  see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature.

I remd you that I am talkg about most  the world\'s l here that controls our fate, cludg the most violent region  the world, where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent  the l.

Back  the mid\'80s when we were designg Biosphere 2, we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions. I mean, what is a biosphere? Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere  life around the Earth, right? Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you\'re gog to build one. And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed  that is, nothg goes  or out at all, no material   energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is. This is a chamber that was 1/00th the size  Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module. And the very first day that this fellow, John len, walked , to spend a couple  days  there with all the plants  animals  bacteria that we\'d put  there to hopefully keep him alive, the doctors were credibly concerned that he was gog to succumb to some dreadful tox, or that his lungs we"

So if nobody\'s really gettg what they want out  these press conferences, why\ndo we pay so much attention to them? Why air them on TV at all? Rosen has a theory. One way we could look at the White House briefg is that it\'s much more  a\nritual act  communication,"
2265,0.0," than it is transmittg formation. Rituals like\nthe White House press conference are tended to show that there is some\naccountability there, that the president has to answer questions, respond to doubts.

You can\'t really see it here, but my bra lit up when he said\nthat because that ritual theory, it kd  makes everythg click. And  ritual, you\'re not tryg to move formation. Instead, you reaffirm values, you\nadvertise the community what it believes . We don\'t care about the press\nconference because it\'s important, it\'s important because we care about it. Because\nthey affirm this idea that the government has to answer to the public.  ideal  the briefg is that you have this operation  which you get a\nchance to ask questions  people who run the most powerful fice  the\nworld.

But women’s bodies, with variable breast\n hip sizes, were much harder to summarize with a sgle number.

When  Weekend battled for the top spot\nagast Just Bieber “And I know she'll be the death  me” “What do you mean?” And then Himself “I only call you when it's half past five” until fally his Michael Jackson spired\nvoice was was dethroned by Adele’s “Hello.” “Hello, It’s Me” Really the only way to know if this hypothesis\nholds up, though, is to crunch the numbers  quantify it. And that’s where Matt came . It kd  fits a really good mold  the\nquestions that I really like, where we have a cultural question about vocal ranges \nusage  falsetto    there is no perfect data set for that. We wanted to make a chart that showed how\nprevalent the male falsetto was  pop , not just  the last 5 years, but as far back\nas we could go. That meant lookg at  streamg services. Every streamg platform tags the millions"
2293,0.0,"\n songs  their respective libraries with metadata, but each one does it a little differently. For example, Spotify has over 35 millions\nsongs  their library, but their metadata is algorithmically driven  pretty broad. Matt: some  it was around the tempo  \n how danceable it was or its somber or positive tone. Pora, on the other h has a smaller library,\nbut they are committed to very specific data. In their case it wasn’t algorithmically\ndriven. y were actually havg humans review songs\n say what its DNA, or what its genome was.  result is a library  2 million songs\nwith up to 50 dividual identifyg markers. So that was terestg to me because falsetto\n vocal range, while could be determed by a computer, ten lends itself to the human\near because there is some subjectivity to it. So, we asked Pora if they had vocal data. y did. And they shared it with us. So do you actually have available the origal\ndataset that we received? Oh yeah yeah I can. Should I just brg that up? It's forty "

So what we said was “OK this is great to\nsee these forty three thous songs but really we only care about songs that charted.” So we created a data set  the Billboard\nHot 100, a 28,000 song list  the 100 most popular songs  the US every week sce 1958.  we went back to Pora. And said we only really want the falsetto\ndata for these songs,  not only do we want the falsetto data, but we also\nneed data about the register. And a few other important thgs, like the\ngender  the person sgg. It’s not just a matter  like puttg\nto their system  it spits out the falsetto data.

So the biggest gap  the data is actually\nthe missg songs that aren't on streamg services, but were on the Billboard Hot 100\n did have very valid falsetto data behd them. So  1958 we have data for 50%  the songs\nthat charted. In 2018 we have data for 95%  the songs\nthat charted.  good thg though is, you thk  an\naverage number one hit from 1958  that's more likely to appear on Pora than a song\nthat hit number 100 for one week. When I first sat down with this giant spreadsheet,\nI immediately wanted to see how songs that I thought had a lot  falsetto had actually\nbeen scored.  first song that I looked for was Childish\nGambo’s “Redbone.” “If you want it, you can have it, ohhhhhh” His voice is super high  very memorable. Not only that, a lot  articles about this\nsong mentioned it had a lot  falsetto. To my astonishment, Pora determed there\nwas no falsetto  the song, stead they said it"

I don't care if it takes all night\nI gonna set this town alight, come on Knowg this, let’s defe what falsetto\n vocal register actually are. To do that I’ve brought  an actual opera\nsger. Hi I'm Anthony Roth Costanzo  I'm a countertenor\n opera sger. Prove it. Perfect, let’s talk about vocal range first.  voices startg from the bottom  the\nclassical tradition are bass, baritone, tenor, contralto, countertenor, mezzo soprano, Soprano. Countertenor is kd  a catch all term \nit's a range that goes up  down. Most male pop stars today are tenors. That means their average range is somewhere\nbetween here  here. Pora’s data scores vocal register  which\nmeasures a sgers ability to go up  down their range consistently. A super high register Pora rates songs from 010 from low to\nhigh. “Rock  Ages” ranked super hi"

But it's not crazy. So when these artists want to access even\nhigher notes they’ll likely switch to their falsetto register. Falsetto is an Italian word which means “false\nlittle voice.” Falsetto is typically a technique ascribed\nto a male sger that switches from their chest voice to their head voice. Whenever you're gog from chest voice  meang\nthe speakg register  to head voice, there's ten a little break because there are two\ndifferent sets  muscles hg f to each other,  that's how you yodel right.

Notice how Freddie Mercury goes from his chest\nvoice to falsetto when he says the word “decle” “A built remedy\nFor Kruschev  Kennedy At anytime an vitation\nYou can't decle” Okay so let me just pause for a second \nsay that “falsetto,” as a term, has been around forever, but its defition has changed \nevolved. Many vocal coaches would say that falsetto\nis that breathy, light sound you heard from Freddie Mercury. And they say the generic term “head voice”\nshould describe crisper, reforced high notes. A perfect example  that is from this 90s\nclassic. “I knew I loved you before I met you. I knew I loved you.” That's amazg. I mean you know that's like a really well\ntegrated strument. For your average  listener, aka me, the\ntechnical distction between head voice  falsetto is less important than the fact that\nthey both just sound impossibly high. That brgs us aga to the scorg system. A 10 on the Pora scale is a song that’s\nsung entirely  Falsetto “Stayg alive” That’s pr"

She’s like oooh oooh baby ahh ah ah” Pora gave this song a 6   their ears,\nDream only used the technique moderately. This is where I could split hairs all day. Because while, yeah, Dream doesn’t use\na falsetto the whole time, the technique plays does play a central role  the track.  hook  the song, the most memorable part,\nis sung  falsetto. Just Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River”\nalso got a 6. “Cry me a river (go on  just)\nCry me a river (go on  just) Cry me a river (baby, go on  just)” So, I’m gog to look at songs with a falsetto\nabove a 5 If there’s one thg I can’t stress enough,\nit’s that this data can be addressed  a 1,000 different ways.

I thk this is probably the first chart I\nmade that just was super simple  just said all right “What is the average value \nall the songs that charted  a year.” First let's focus on vocal register. I was not expectg to see this just a very\nclear like march to the top  the late 80s  average vocal register for male sger\n 1988 was a 7.1. But as you can see across any time period,\nthat average never really dropped below 5.. Because there were so many songs  1988 that\nhad a register  7 or higher, we’re gog to make this a little bit tougher. I’m gog to boost the register to an 8\n only allow songs that made it  the top 10. We’ve got a strong hard rock  heavy metal\nshowg. “She's got a smile it seems to me” re’s my man Phil Colls “I'm always right there beside her\nWe're two hearts” I’ve literally never heard this song “I can rocket 2 u” Okay, wow.

So let’s see how this chart changes when\nwe just focus on falsetto. Thgs start to shift gog back from the\n1980s to the 1970s  the disco era. 1975 was the highest year for falsetto. Where 18%  songs had a value over . It also serves as a turng pot for the\nBee Gees. This might be surprisg to hear, but before\n1975 the Bee Gees’s average falsetto was around 0.8. After 1975 it rose to a 5.5. And that makes sense. y had to compete with the likes  Earth,\nWd,  Fire, Ohio Players, Eddie Kendricks, Curtis Mayfield  all artists whose careers\nwere defed by their high voices.

Some experts say that this is partly because consumers\ndon’t go around lookg for prices comparg them between hospitals. Like they do when\nthey buy a car or anythg else for that matter.

For just the cost  the hospital room, this\nstudy found that the price varied between $1,189  $11,986. So I realized I am gog\nto have to go ask the specific hospital where my wife is givg birth figure this out. Every\nhospital has a giant list they call the chargemaster which details all the services they provide\n what they cost. And each item  service  the hospital has a code. If a doctor spends\n20 mutes with you, that’s a different code  a different price than if they spent\n0 mutes with you.

(dramatic ) In late 2018, thgs were\ngog pretty well for Boeg.  Before the first crash,\nBoeg thought  the MAX as a cash cow that\nwould keep on producg.  y were just breakg\nall sorts  records for revenue  airplane deliveries.  [Narrator] A global boom  air travel had helped the company\nearn record prits, which drove it\'s stock\nprice to new heights.  Problem prior to the crash for Boeg was that Boeg couldn\'t\nmake the MAX fast enough. We wrote about how Boeg was runng out \nparkg spots for the MAX.  [Narrator]  MAX\nis the latest iteration  Boeg\'s 737 aircraft, which first entered\ncommercial service  1968.

And essentially what\'s the big deal.  [Narrator] Boeg at the time argued that pilots didn\'t need to know about the existence  the\nautomated flight control system, who\'s name the public would\neventually learn was MCAS.  Well how can that be? How can there be somethg on a plane, not only that pilots\ndidn\'t fully underst  weren\'t traed on, but also just didn\'t know that it existed.  After the first crash I thk\nwe still didn\'t yet realize how big the story would become. (mellow )  [Narrator]  orig  the MAX scal has it\'s roots  the rivalry\nbetween Airbus  Boeg. Ever sce the 1990\'s the two companies have\nbeen locked  competition. By the 2010\'s the\ncommercial aviation market was essentially a stable duopoly, with each company controllg\nroughly half  the market. At the heart  this rivalry has long be"
2480,1.0,"en each company\'s flagship commercial passenger plane. For Boeg, that aircraft is the 737, for Airbus, it\'s the A320. (dramatic ) In 2010, Airbus shook up the market when it announced the A320 Neo, an updated version \nthe A320 aircraft le. Neo planes wouldn\'t\njust be updated versions  a familiar aircraft, they\nwould also be cheaper to run.  Fuel efficiency\'s the\ntouchstone  anythg that airles do. I mean, if you talk about bean\ncounters  penny pchers, airles are the ultimate  those areas.  [Narrator] It\'s time to thk max.  Boeg did not design\na completely new plane from the ground up because\nit would have taken too long.  [Narrator] To make the MAX, Boeg took the existg 737 air frame  paired it with a new,\nmore powerful enge. But dog that changed\nthe plane\'s aerodynamics. One effect was that \nrare flyg conditions the aircraft\'s nose would pitch up. This is where the MCAS stware came . It was designed to automatically\npush the plane\'s nose down.  One former Boeg engeer"
2481,1.0,"\nwho didn\'t work on the MAX, characterized the stware\nfix as a b aid. We\'ve been learng for the last year how the b aid wasn\'t as\nstrong as Boeg needed it to be. (slow piano )  [Narrator] On March\n10th 2019, a second crash. This time  Ethiopia. l 157 people on board were killed.  [Male] I heard about the second crash.  When on Sunday morng.  I woke up  kd  rolled\nover  looked at my phone.  I got a text from an airle ficial,  it simply read, ""MAX eight"". I thought, how could this be, another one?  From the moment that\nthe second crash happened, we\'ve really thought or written\nabout almost nothg else.  Plane crashes \ngeneral are pretty rare. Plane crash with five\nmonths  each other, is pretty stunng. (dramatic )  This is unparalleled \nmodern commercial aviation. It doesn\'t happen.  [Narrator] A day after the crash,  an unprecedented move,\n grounded the MAX. Other nations quickly followed.   groundg the planes before the FAA had done\nthat was a huge deal,  it came as a hu"
2482,1.0,"ge\nsurprise to all  us.  Historically speakg,\nthe FAA has always been the, the leader that all the\nother countries followed.  [Narrator] This was the\nfirst time  aviation history that any nation\'s regulatory\nbody had overruled the FAA.  An emergency order  prohibition to ground all flights\n the 737 MAX eight.  [Narrator] Two days\nlater, the FAA relented  decided to ground the MAX. This marked the begng\n the agency\'s troubles, as the MAX crisis brought the regulator under creased scruty. In April, Boeg began to face\nthe fancial consequences  the scal.  then emerged that Boeg\nhadn\'t formed the FAA the warng system that\nhelped pilots diagnose an MCAS malfunction wasn\'t\nworkg as tended. Boeg\'s lack  transparency about MCAS was highlighted yet aga when a recordg emerged  a meetg.  [Michael] If you\'re\ngonna give us a system that we are gonna be affected by, it\'s hugely important that\nwe get briefed on what it is.  [Narrator]  story was\nbased partially on a recordg made "
2483,1.0,"about a month after the first crash, when a group  Boeg executives met with the American\nAirles pilot union. In the tape, the pilots\nconfront the executives, sayg they were not told\nenough about the plane.  [Michael] Most people say, ""If it a\'t Boeg, it a\'t go\'."" That\'s where most  us get that from because we thk we\'ve\nbeen dealt with honestly by the company. We\'re gettg told via the news media that you know what, the average pilot, that\'s a little bit too much formation for him to underst \nbe able to comprehend.  [Narrator] n  July it was revealed that after the first crash, the FAA had done it\'s own\nternal risk analysis  a potential second crash.  ir analysis showed that if the FAA  Boeg didn\'t do anythg  just kept the planes\noperatg as they had been, there would be 15 crashes\nover some two decades. That would make the 737 MAX\nthe most dangerous jet airler ever developed  the modern world.  What was gog on side Boeg? What was gog on side FAA? Did anyone discuss grou"
2484,1.0,"ndg the plane after the first crash?  A lot  questions have been raised about what the FAA\'s role was. Whether the agency was\nreally dog it\'s job  overseeg the design\n production  the MAX. You know, the FAA\ndelegates Boeg employees to do some  that oversight itself,  I thk some people\nhave questioned whether that has gone too far. You know, whether it\'s sort  the fox guardg the hen house. (mellow )  We set out to p pot the root cause  how Boeg created\na plane that crashes. We really tried to get to the heart  how they came to these decisions.  Why didn\'t they use two sensors? y only used one sensor  that is sort  a\nviolation  basic engeerg.  At the root  it Boeg made an credibly\nflawed assumption.  But they failed to recognize badly, that all these other emergency\nsignals would be confusg. Would make it very very\ndifficult for a crew to do the right thg\n a fast enough way.  [Narrator] Despite the tense scruty surroundg the MAX, at that time Boeg wasn\'t\nespecially forthc"
2485,1.0,"omg with formation about the plane.  I spent much  the summer\nknockg a lot  doors  the Seattle area, tryg\nto fd Boeg  FAA people who would help us underst\nhow all this happened. People would politely\nsay no, close the door, sometimes it was more  a\ndoor beg slammed  our face.  We went to, I thk it was\nsomethg like 200 houses, you know, drove 500 miles. It was really difficult to get people to agree to talk with us.  [Narrator] That fall,\nBoeg CEO, Dennis Muilenburg appeared before congress, where he was sharply\ncriticized by senators.  How did you not,  February, set out a ne alarm fire to say, we need to figure out\nexactly what happened.  We\'re not quite sure\nwhat Mr Faulkner meant by that exchange.  I thk it was widely thought that he did not perform\nwell  those heargs.  He survived two days \nreally tough questiong, but he was brutally wounded.  In conjunction with those heargs he sat down with family members\n a closed door meetg,  they sat there with large posters with"
2486,1.0," photos  their loved ones. In one case, a family\nmember brought photos just  the cfs  his\nwife  his mother  law,  his three children,  he lost  he told the Boeg ficials, cludg Dennis Muilenburg, that he didn\'t feel they deserved to see his family members\' faces. In December, the company fally said, we can\'t keep makg these planes, we\'re gog to have to\nshut down our factory. And that has a huge ripple effect throughout the supply cha,  I thk, all  the relatively rosy projections that Dennis Muilenburg had been\nmakg throughout the year, fally it came to a head,  the board said enough is enough.  [Narrator] Less than a month\nlater, Muilenburg was fired.  It wasn\'t surprisg when\nMuilenburg was pushed out, it was more surprisg\nthat it took the board as long as it did to push Muilenburg out.  He wasn\'t visible. You know a question that came up a lot was ""Where is Dennis?""  [Narrator] In the new year, Boeg has contued to\ngrapple with the fall out from the MAX scal.  end  which d"

On January 10th, Boeg released a batch \nternal communications.  y showed Boeg employees talkg about trickg regulators  say some really unflatterg thgs about the regulators that\nthey were dealg with.  It gives you a real glimpse\nto culture side Boeg.  [Narrator] It was\nthese ternal messages that likely led to\nBoeg\'s h beg forced to reverse their long held stance that pilots didn\'t need\nsimulator trag.  That is a stunng development.

Frieden that contact
2550,0.0, tracg is really a key component a key approach that will allow us to reopen safely one thg that I don't hear a lot about about contact tracg though that I want to brg to your attention is that it's also a key source  data that we badly need we currently have very little understg about where people are gettg fected our most new cases  longterm care facilities or correctional facilities which we know are highrisk settgs but we don't have a good sense  whether 99%  our cases origate  those special settgs or whether it's a small fraction we don't know whether people who are essential workers still performg duties  the community are gettg fected or we don't know whether most fections are happeng at home gettg a better understg  what that looks like will help us to guide better terventions if it is special settgs we know we need to be dog more to protect people there but we might also assess the risk to the general community to be lower on the other h if most people are gettg fected at home
2551,0.0, that pots for a need for some sort  central isolation capacity by which I mean if people feel that they would be safer recoverg  a hotel away from their families for example that should be an option that should be made available to them but we would want to know what fraction  cases are origatg  the household to underst whether that is an important vestment this formation on where transmission is occurrg is  critical importance but it's not currently beg prioritized  it is contact tracg that allows us to collect this data so  addition to beg a key tool for contament it's also a key tool for helpg us to guide our response  the decisions that we need for that the third pillar is health care capacity we were able to secure enough healthcare capacity to treat everyone with kovat only through extraordary measures like cancelg an elective procedures  turng operatg rooms to ICUs but right as we start to thk about unwdg some  those decisions is when states are movg to reopen  so we need to be

2567,0.0,ause you could test 1% but exactly as dr. River said if you test the wrong 1% you're not gog to be optimally controllg you have to look at those with symptoms most likely to spread most likely to die  congregate facilities healthcare workers with symptoms contacts who are symptoms symptomatic hospitalized patients even without symptoms because they can spread it widely all people  a nursg home if there is a case there because there can be explosive spread essential workers who are asymptomatic so I thk it's key to look at the numbers but our estimate is that you would need at least two or three times a current volume even if you only tested the highest priority people to do it but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot we can't do at the same time to ramp up our other thgs because it's not gog to be one thg gets us out  this accept a vacce that's right  so we have to do all these thgs but with the tests to get to where we need to be to be testg those essential workers part  my understg is
2568,0.0, the test that we are usg now is efficient  expensive  requires a lot more  the swabs  other equipment that we frankly are just havg shortages  so where are we with potcontact testg more stant testg  even if their accuracy is not as good as the current test we're usg is it worth it if it is more widely distributed  lets us test more  these essential workers  people at the greatest risk there are two broad ways  testg for the virus itself through lookg for the genetic particles like the PCR that's beg done  lookg for antibodies I'll leave antibody testg aside because there are many unknowns about it with the potcare testg for the virus there are some systems that are relatively rapid now but they're low throughput so you're only gog to be testg a few people each hour or people over a fourhour period so that rapid pot  care needs to be looked at there are newer technologies  older technologies that may be helpful but you're always gog to have to take a good sample  you're always gog to h

2571,0.0, specific objective data about that do we prospectively looked at for their coronavirus for kovat 19 for kovat 19 if we look at formation from around the world it's very clear that when people stay home it reduces the spread but it's also clear doctor that there are countries cludg Sgapore  South Korea that been able to limit the amount  physical restrictions or physical distancg  still control the virus  there are differences  different environments so Florida for stance didn't put  stay at home but their case rate is lower than Maryl's for stance right there are many factors that go to what the case rate is that's right so so so my pot is that that shelterplace might work but it might be just the fitness the social distancg the shelter  place obviously implies now dr. rivers I looked at the recommendations from AEI there a month old is that right yes so we've learned a lot  the last month haven't we about this disease so for stance as we ramp up testg the first criteria is that your 
2572,0.0,case count has to go down well as you ramp up testg you're gonna fd cases that you wouldn't have found so for stance I'm sure you're aware there's a Michigan prison where they tested all their prisoners 60% tested positive they were asymptomatic  an Ohio prison 73% tested positive the vast majority asymptomatic so they're clearly asymptomatic cases around  as you ramp up testg so what you're gog to do is you can be chasg your tail  now sce the entire purpose  restrictions was to mimize stress on the healthcare system right because we want our healthcare system take care  people so that they don't die then why wouldn't hospitalizations or ICU occupancy even more importantly be the benchmark because  Maryl we've plateaued  ICU utilizations but our case counts contue to go up as we beg to go to a hot spot for stance the processg facilities poultry processg facilities well you go  there there are a lot  healthy people they may have corona virus but they're otherwise healthy they're asympto

Gottlieb suggested where it would be people who come  to doctors fices so that you're gettg a rom sample startg with people who have symptoms  the nice thg about contact tracg is once you get  that network  once you are connected to people who are fected  the people who might get fected because they have been exposed you can contue to follow the network outward  so you don't have to be as concerned about checkg here there  everywhere because you really start to get a hle on transmission  the community so this sort  brgs us back to where we started that to even open somethg essential like child care th

Out  the myriad problems that emerged \nthe world  Sprg 2020, there is one that is quietly beg solved—one that has to\ndo with the behdthescenes  a globalized, modernday economy. Understg it is easy. At its core, it’s a simple supply  dem\nmismatch. You see, back  March 2020, when COVID19\nreached pemic status, almost every airle  the world drastically scaled back its flyg. It varied from region to region  airle\nto airle, but the common trend everywhere was that, if any route got cut, it was almost\ncertaly a longhaul one. In the era  quarante periods, border closgs,\n other travel restrictions, there is nearzero dem for longhaul, ternational travel,\nso tercontental flights were quickly removed from airle schedules. For example,  April 2019, about 500 roundtrip\nflights per day would fly between Euro"
2670,0.0,"pe  the US, however,  April 2020, that number\nwas reduced to about 80 per day. That represents between an 80%  90% reduction. Ignorg airle revenue, you’d thk that\nthat would be a lossfree situation, though: it reduces carbon emissions, many governments\nare coverg the salaries  furloughed workers, it reduces airle expenditure,  nobody’s\nridg  the cabs anyways, but that doesn’t consider what rides below the cab. On nearly every tercontental flight, \nthe belly hold, among the hundreds  passenger bags, there is cargo. In fact, 5%  the world’s air cargo is\ncarried  this method. Now, the math to expla the supply  dem\nmismatch is simple.  proportion  cargo carried on passenger\naircraft varies from route to route, so 60%  Western Europe to US air cargo, for example,\nflies on passenger planes. 80% to 90%  transatlantic passenger flights\nare not flyg, which means that about 50%  air cargo capacity  this market has disappeared\n a matter  weeks.  situation is less severe  other markets,"
2671,0.0,"\nbut, dustrywide, the overall air cargo capacity reduction was about 23%  March,\n2020. So that’s the supply figure, but what about\ndem? As a huge proportion  the world entered\nvarious lockdown scenarios, economic forecasts plummeted.  extent  the fancial toll will not\nbe clear for a while, but it is clear that it is deeply negative. This all has an effect on air cargo dem. On a macro level, consumers are buyg less,\nwhich means less is shipped, which means companies are buyg less, which means less is shipped,\nwhich means suppliers are makg less, which means less is shipped. On a micro level, different jurisdictions\nworldwide differ on the exact details  their Coronavirus response, but  many places,\nfactories are shut down which means supply chas are cut. So, from an economic perspective, one would\npredict that dem would almost certaly be down, but like all thgs  the age \nCoronavirus, there is another domant perspective—that  public health. From almost the moment COVID19 emerg"
2672,0.0,"ed, it\nbecame clear that it was a highly fectious virus, which means that a crucial component\n the safe treatment  an fected dividual is the use  personal protective equipment,\nor PPE. In this context, that means, masks, shields,\ngowns,  more, which healthcare facilities always stock, but never  the quantity needed\nto cover nearly universal staff usage for a long period. That means that,  order to reduce the risk\n staff exposure, nearly every hospital  the world needed more PPE. Purely by chance, it turns out that the number\none medical PPE producg country  the world was also the first country to experience COVID19—. Before the pemic, the country produced\n20 million medical masks per day, or about half  the world’s supply. By the begng  March, though, this had\nalready been scaled up to more than 100 million per day. It was at exactly this time when, simultaneously,\n’s manufacturg dustry started to ch back to life  the virus  took\nhold  the rest  the world. With how fast COVI"

Considerg air cargo capacity dropped by\n23%, that means that there was an 8% gap between supply  dem. In the context  this enormous dustry,\n8% is huge,  so the laws  supply  dem followed their course.  cost to transport goods by air spiked,\nespecially  the crucial Asia to US  Europe markets. In the last two weeks  March, air cargo\nrates from Hong Kong to North America jumped 27% above normal, while rates from Shanghai\nto Europe creased by 50%. Of course, after a supply  dem mismatch\neconomic forces push companies to crease supply, which is exactly what happened. Cargo airles"
2674,0.0," that could massively ramped\nup their flights. Kalitta Air, for example, an American cargo\nairle, brought some aircraft out  storage  creased its longhaul flyg by nearly\n50%. However, there is only so much that these\ncargo airles can do. y only have so many aircraft, so many pilots,\n so many mechanics so they can’t massively ramp up their operations  a short time. Who did have extra capacity, though, were\npassenger airles,  that’s where a small solution emerged. A plane with no passengers is not necessarily\nan empty plane. An average airle earns 15% to 20%  its\nrevenue through cargo, but keep  md what an average airle looks like. Most  the average North American airles’\nflyg is domestic  shorthaul, where little cargo is carried, so the proportion  revenue\ncomg from cargo on a longhaul flight is far higher. Consider too that, on a normal longhaul passenger\nflight, a considerable portion  the cargo hold is filled with baggage so that 15 to\n20% is derived from only some  the c"

Now, normally, a passenger a330, for example,\nhas capacity for 38 thous pounds or 17 thous kilograms  cargo  its belly hold. That’s compared to the freighter version\n the a330 which can carry 132 thous pounds or 60 thous kilograms  freight thanks\nto its completely empty cab. That means that the passenger a330 can only\ncarry 29% as much cargo as its freighter counterpart. However, considerg that freight rates have\nrisen by as much as 50%, that means that flyg these aircraft can earn about % as much\nper flight as their freighter counterparts normally do. Makg less than half as much as cargo airles\nclearly would not make flyg passenger aircraft for cargo purposes worth it, but there is\nmore to consider.

In normal conditions, fuel is airles’\nnumber one cost so havg that drop by a factor  five reduces the cost to operate a flight\ndramatically. That means that they need to earn far less\nthan what a cargo airle does  normal conditions to breakeven. In addition, most airles are payg their\npilots  other staff anyways. In the US, for example, airles are required,\nas a condition  their government relief fundg, to not lay f or furlough any staff,\nso the margal staffg cost to operate an additional flight is mimal. Thirdly, with no passengers, airles have\nquickly novated new ways to carry cargo. Many airles have loaded their passenger\ncabs with cargo placed directly on top   fastened to seats. This dramatically creases complexity \nloadg time, but it also dramatically creases capacity. l  these conditions  circumstances\ncombe to the pot that, for this brief moment  time, economics dictate that an\nairle can tur"

This also created flights that have never\nhappened before, like a 16hour nonstop cargoonly trip from Sydney to Toronto by Air Canada. But it wasn’t all just big airles on long\nflights.

This probably seems countertuitive.  more lanes there are the higher the capacity\na road has so cars should be able to drive faster... but that’s a very narrow analysis\n the problem. You can’t just thk about how this would\nwork on one road, you have to thk about it  the context  a whole city. Many people choose not to drive places because\n how long it takes. If the traffic is bad, they can take public\ntransit or wait until a less busy time, or just not travel at all. When a road is exped, travel times itially\ndecrease so all those people who chose not to drive or to take an alternate route or\nwhatever decide to switch to usg that newly exped road. What’s fascatg about roads is that this\nhappens at a perfect 1 to 1 ratio. If the capacity  a road doubles, the amount\n people usg that road will also double. If it doubles aga, the amount will aga\ndouble. Of course if you kept dog this over \nover aga"
2683,0.0," you would eventually build a big enough road that there wouldn’t be any more\ncars to fill the road, but  the real world where dem for roads far outstrips supply,\ndrivers will adjust to any change  road capacity. So does that mean that it’s hopeless? Is there no way to solve traffic? No way to make our roads better  safer\n more efficient? Well... no. re’s plenty we can do. Here’s the thg about traffic—it slows\ndown exponentially.  20,000 car on the road slows down traffic\noverall significantly more than the 5,000 car. This is a major driver for a lot  jams—a\nsmall addition  cars leads to a large addition  congestion—but it also makes solvg\ntraffic a bit easier sce you only need to remove a small amount  cars from the road\n that’s just what ramp meters do. Ramp meters are set up on the onramps \nhighways to restrict the amount  people gettg on the highway. y usually let one car on every five or\nsix seconds. Sce the amount  cars actually on the highway\nis kept down, the highway"
2684,0.0," stays at its most efficient speed. Mnesota did an experiment where they shut\ndown their longused ramp meters for eight weeks  order to see if they actually worked\n they found that the highway capacity decreased by 9%, travel times creased by 22%, speeds\ndropped by 7%,  crashes creased by 26%. Stockholm, Sweden used that exponential nature\n traffic to decrease travel times by up to 0%  2006. Stockholm as a city lies across 1 isls\nwhich means that all the bridges act as huge chokepots. Traffic, therefore, was historically horrible\nfor the relatively small city. On January 3rd, 2006, Stockholm started to\ncharge drivers who entered this central perimeter—the busiest area.  charge wasn’t much—between 10 \n20 krona, the equivalent  1  2 US dollars— but it was enough to persuade 20%  drivers\nto not enter the central perimeter. y either went downtown on public transport\nor walked or didn’t go at all. se are the amounts  daily drivers \nthe perimeter  the years leadg up to the charge."
2685,0.0," As soon as the charge was implemented  2006,\nthe daily amount dropped down to here. It wasn’t a fluke. After the 6 month itial trial period drivg\n the central core became free aga  the amount  daily drivers creased to nearly\nthe level it was before. When the charge became permanent  2007,\ndaily numbers once aga plummeted. Even though the charge was muscule, it was\nenough to dissuade 10s  thouss  people from usg those roads. re are really two costs  drivg—the\nmoney  the time. When the time it takes to drive isn’t enough\n a cost to prevent people from drivg, these charges crease the overall cost to\na level where some people will decide not to drive. But what about safety? Roads are still unbelievably dangerous. In any given year, 1 out  every 10,000 people\n the US die  a car accident. Just thk about how high  a proportion\nthat is. If you go to a Redsks game at FedEx field\nnear Washgton, DC, eight  the people sittg  the sts with you will die  the next\nyear  a car accident. It"
2686,0.0," turns out one  the best ways to prevent\naccidents is with somethg you’ve almost certaly already seen or used—the roundabout. re’s a reason you see these more \nmore. Roundabouts reduce deaths  serious juries\nby 90%. That is not an error. With roundabouts, there’s almost no opportunity\nfor the worst type  collision—the head on full speed crash. In a traditional tersection, cars come with\nfeet  each other while gog at a relative speed  up to 100 mph. A headon crash at that speed is undoubtedly\ncatastrophic. With roundabouts, cars naturally slow down\nto about 1525 miles per hour sce they’re gog around a curve. so, if there were to be a collision, it\nwould either be a sideimpact collision if a car failed to turn to the circle or a\nsidetoside collision if a car misjudged the curve. Both  these collisions happen at a low relative\nspeed so fatalities are low. But what about capacity? Surely the lowerspeed roundabouts cause horrible\ntraffic problems. Well... they don’t. A sgle lane "
2687,0.0,"roundabout can hle a maximum\n 1800 vehicles per hour which is exactly the same as a traditional twolane signaled\ntersection. While cars will move through a signaled tersection\nat a much higher speed, they have to wait both for the light to change  leftturng\ncars. With roundabouts, you have a smooth, consistent,\nalbeit slower, flow. So what’s the problem? Why haven’t we replaced every tersection\nwith a roundabout? Well there are disadvantages—they’re more\ndifficult for pedestrians, especially those who are deaf or bld, they require a larger\nfootprt, they’re more expensive to mata—but the real reason roundabouts are not ubiquitous\nnowadays is because  the biggest fallacy  road design—that drivers need rules. Poynton, just outside  Manchester, , used\nto have a typical, rather dreary tersection  nobody really liked it. Cars would back up for miles, pedestrians\nhad to wait forever for the light to change,  it essentially split the town apart. So someone had the idea to remove the"
2688,0.0," traffic\nlights, remove the zebra crossgs, the curbs, remove almost every safety device  the tersection\n just set up two adjog roundabouts. Surely this would wreak havoc, but it didn’t. Turns out, when people are uncomfortable,\nwhen people aren’t really sure what’s gog on, they pay more attention.  green light was a signal to people that\nthe road was clear, that it was safe to speed, that they could let their guard down, but\nafter the change the cars were able to flow freely, albeit at a slow pace, stead \nwaitg for the lights to change. Pedestrian cidents went down, collisions\nwent down, traffic flowed faster,  the city center fally had some character. So, all around the world cities are replicatg\nwhat Poynton did. y’re removg curbs, traffic lights,\n pedestrian crossgs to make one shared space. l around the world, these streets are resultg\n fewer accidents  more pedestrian space. Discomfort is savg lives. On a larger scale, there’s one more novative\ntersection design that’s "
2689,0.0,"begng to save lives—the divergg diamond terchange. This terchange is designed as a way to get\nmore cars on  f highways faster. After the onramp to the right side, the road\ncrosses over so cars never have to traverse active lanes to get onto the highway. A car headg north can effortlessly jo\nthe onramp without crossg traffic,  a car headg south will cross over so it\ndrives on the left side  can effortlessly jo the onramp to head south. Not only is this easier for drivers, it improves\nsafety.  dangerousness  an tersection is ten\nrated by determg the number  conflict pots—possible pots where accidents could\nhappen under normal circumstances. With a traditional onramp tersection there\nare 26. With a divergg diamond tersection, only\n1. And they’re faster too.  US Department  Transportation found\n a study that universally, whether the traffic was light or heavy, divergg diamond terchanges\nlet more cars through faster. It costs less too.

But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook? Probably quite far sce its a frequent\n substantial purchase. That’s why Apple stores are rather rare\neven  cities. You need an enormous amount  people to susta\none Apple store  we can actually figure out roughly how many. In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is\nabout 20 miles away from the New Haven store to the northeast  the Stamford store to\nthe southwest. In the 10 mile radius around the Trumbull\nApple Store there are about half a million habitants which tells us that you need about\nhalf a million people to susta one Apple store. We can compare that to the Starbucks’ \nlower Manhattan which are spread out at an "

Of course both Connecticut  New York are\nplaces with higher than average comes which means less people are needed to susta one\nStarbucks or Apple Store.  numbers would be very different , say,\nrural Kansas, but sce each store generally only builds  areas with higherthanaverage\ncomes this gives a good sense  how many people Apple  Starbucks looks for  an\narea before openg up a store. So, our model shows where cities should be,\nbut its not like this  reality. This is the most efficient spread  cities\nif you’re assumg that the cities are on a perfectly flat plane with no geographic\nfeatures, no social fluences, no variability  come, equal distribution  resources—essentially\nassumg the world is one homogeneous place… which its not. In reality,  course, our world has an enormous\neffect on where  "
2697,0.0,"why cities develop. To start out, let’s cut this down to one\ncity on a flat, featureless plane for simplicity. What affects the location  cities more than\nanythg is water. If we put an ocean on one side  our isotropic\nplane, our city will almost certaly locate near it. Oceans have always been  still are what\nconnects the world. re’s no other means  transport that\ncan move such enormous amounts  cargo for so little. Any city needs to be economically efficient\nto grow  it will cost more to brg goods to a city that’s 1000 miles l than\none right by the ocean. Just look at Europe. 6  the 10 largest European cities are with\n100 miles  the coast. But oceans aren’t the only bodies  water\nto affect cities. Rivers are just as or perhaps even more fluential. Milan, the 19th largest European city, is\nthe largest to not be either directly on the ocean or on a river,  even then its only\n15 miles from a river  75 miles from the ocean. Until the last century or so, cities could\nnot survive"
2698,0.0," without direct water access. If you need more pro, 1  the 15 largest\ncities  the world are with a few dozen miles  the ocean. Perhaps the most obvious attractor for cities\nis resources, so gog back to our isotropic plane, puttg natural resources anywhere\non this map will draw cities near it. Cities that existed before the last century\nor so generally sprung up right near the resources, much like Pittsburgh, sce they acted as\nmanufacturg  transportation hubs for those resources, but more recently new resource\ndependent cities don’t need to be as close to the resources themselves. New transportation technologies can brg\nthe resources from their source. Just look at Dubai. Of course the UAE has enormous oil deposits,\nbut they’re much closer to    the SouthWest than Dubai. In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 residents, less\nthan half that  Carlisle, Pennsylvania—one  the farmg towns we talked about at the\nbegng. That only grew to 0,000 by 1960, but today\nits known worldwide  has more tha"
2699,0.0,"n 2.5 million residents. It was able to grow at this enormous rate—even\nfaster than  —sce it cemented itself as the economic  admistrative\nhub for the oil dustries  the region. Another geographic feature that we can add\nto the plane is mountas. Now, mountas don’t always have a uniform\naffect on cities. Mexico City, Bogota,  Addis Ababa are all\nenormous cities at elevations above 7,000 feet. Mountas do make transport  trade difficult,\nbut they also provide protection. Many ancient cities grew  these locations\nsce they were easy to protect, which left more time to focus on growg the city, but\nmountas can also hder development. For quite a while, the United States could\nnot develop west  the Appalachian mountas. y just served as an enormous barrier. In 1800, the average center  population\nfor the entire United States was here even though the US had sovereignty over this entire\narea. Of course technology eventually conquered\nthis barrier  moved the mean population center all th"
2700,0.0,"e way out to Missouri today,\nbut if the Appalachian mountas didn’t exist American history  geography would\nbe completely different. We would have seen urban development much\nearlier  the midwest. But mountas can have another effect. You see, coal, silver, gold,  other meral\ndeposits are all ten located  mountaous regions, , just like Dubai, cities can\ndevelop  less hospitable  easy places due to resources.  economic advantage  exploitg the resources\noverpowers the economic disadvantage  beg  an hospitable location. Denver, Colorado grew 650% between 1870 \n1880 with the openg  a railroad branch connectg with the transcontental railroad. It served as an access pot to transportation\nto the gold mers  the rockies. So mountas can either push cities away or\nbrg them nearer—it really just depends on the circumstance. Let’s exchange our isotropic plane for a\nworld map. Where should cities be on here? Well, our world’s cities are not necessarily\nall  the most geographically efficient"
2701,0.0," locations. While there is a certa level  natural\nselection that grows the efficiently placed cities  shrks the efficiently placed\ncities, humans are not always able to put cities  the most efficient locations. Let’s put up the 22 cities  the world\nwith a population over 2 million. You can immediately see some patterns. Puttg up the equator, you can see a clear\ndivide. Only 32  these cities lie  the southern\nhemisphere. One might thk this is because there is so\nmuch more l  the northern hemisphere, but that’s not entirely true. You see, the southern hemisphere still has\n32%  the world’s l, but only has 1%  the world’s large cities. re’s clearly a higher density  cities\n the northern hemisphere. You can pretty much trace this all back to\nEurope  Asia.  first large civilizations  empires\nwere on these two contents even though the human race likely origated  Africa. re’s hundreds  different theories on\nwhy civilizations succeeded  some places  failed  others, but one  the more\"
2702,0.0,"nplausible  terestg theories is that Europe  Asia succeeded because they’re\nwide stead  tall.  very shape  the contents may have\nchanged the course  human history. You see, when a content is wide, you have\na ton  l with roughly the same climate. Climate tends to change when you go north\n south rather than east  west as a nature  how the earth rotates around the sun. Much  the success  early civilizations\nhad to do with the domestication  plants  animals  the correspondg technology. When expg horizontally, the climate is\nsimilar enough that an empire can use the same successful plants  animals, while\nexpg vertically requires the domestication  new plants  animals. If a civilization started  centralamerica,\nfor example, there would be very little l on the content with a similar climate \ntheir expansion would be severely limited. In Europe  Asia, on the other h, theres\nthouss upon thouss  miles  similar climate that can be reached just by travelg\neast or west. re’s evidence to "

Just look at the maps  the four largest\nearly empires—the Qg Dynasty, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate,  the\nMongol empire. y were all  Eurasia  they all exped\nhorizontally. When some  the more modern empires exped,\nthey had the technology to do so overseas.  three major modern empires were the British,\nSpanish,  French empires—each  which came from relatively similar climates. A major reason why America was able to succeed\nis because all the agriculture from Europe worked there. Climatically, Europe  America are nearly\nidentical.  majority  developed colonized countries\nare  the northern hemisphere just because they were closest to Europe, but formerly\nBritish countries like South Africa, Australia,  New Zeal are all highly developed \n the Southern Hemisphere. ir success over more northern countries\n the southern hemisphere can also be partially attributed to their greater climate similarity\nto Europe. Let’s ask one more question. If our world onl"
2704,0.0,"y had one city, where would\nit logically be? Well if you take the location  every person\n the world  average it out, you come to southcentral Asia. That means that this general region is the\noptimum place to live on the planet, but where more specifically should our world city go. Well, this region is already  the Northern\nHemisphere   Eurasia, so we’ve already covered those two criteria. We want a place with a hundred  so miles\n the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountas with rich meral deposits—the sgle best\nplace for a city on earth just might be… Dhaka, Bangladesh. Every geographic model  theory says that\nthere is no better place on earth to put a city than here. re’s evidence to back this up: Dhaka\nis between the th  18th largest metropolitan area on earth dependg on how you defe\nmetropolitan area,  Bangladesh is the sixth densest country on earth—there are 161 million\npeople livg  an area about the size  Engl.
