1,0.0,"[] yeah Irish aqua five bucks North North Korea ah here we go [] so this is  right here right across the river as North Korea  it is absolutely dark [] respect for the president   they told them I said you'll make a much better deal Andre rid  this menace or do somethg about the Menace  North Korea because that's what it is it's a menace right there the relationship between   North Korea has always been complicated 's Mao Zedong famously said that the two countries were as close as lips  teeth a relationship forged  blood  steel durg the Korean War agast the United States the leaders have famously kept up with that appearance sce the times  Mao  North Korea's founder Kim ilsung  to the next generation with Kim jongil but somethg's changed kim jongm sce he came to power  2012 this supposedly close relationship is shaped at the seams as leader Kim has never left the country not even to visit Beijg like his father  his grfather had this is the last time Kim was seen with a highlevel Chese leader  it's been downhill sce despite North Korea's reliance on  mistrust has been brewg on both sides   North Korea share an 880 mile border split by two rivers the Yalu  the two men both comg from the same source a slumberg supervolcano straddlg the border known to Chese as Chung by Shan  to the Koreans all Koreans as mount paektu many believe this border is the lifele  the North Korean regime nety percent  North Korea's trade is with  I have been reportg from side North Korea for many years reportg will be closely watched but we expect to show you a country that the world knows very little about but we have rarely been allowed to leave their showcase capital  Pyongyang to see the rest  the country I'm curious to fd out exactly what we could see from over here our plan to travel the entire border or as far as we can from the Yellow Sea  the south to the regions rattled by Pyongyang's nuclear testg  the north our startg pot dondon't it's a bustlg unmistakeably Chese city  Commerce  condos connectg to the North Korean city  cn a Jew by a sgle bridge the sokorean hip Bridge 70 percent   North Korea trade passes across this bridge despite UN sanctions there's a steady stream  trucks  tourists gog back  forth I would love to know what's side these trucks what this trade is [] so wanna see where there's trucks go when they come f the bridge I thk they wd around  go to a transportation center maybe that's where they unload what they've gotten loaded up aga  the morng [] yep written  Korean licenses so these are clearly North Korean yeah ha your thumb don't worry mom looks like the back is open let's see what he got  there this thg might may have already been unloaded [] so this was clearly somethg they loaded up took it over to North Korea earlier today  then they just came back so the probably gonna reload for tomorrow all  these trucks have North Korean license plates this was loaded up now it's empty thouss  curious Chese tourists descend on dondon't to gawk at the reclusive neighbors from across the Yalu all along the river there are many tourist spots set up like some human safari what did you see what do you thk have you been there before 18:02 thought nigga Shamu it's never been there go they sound too normal you want to go there what do you thk about all this nuclear testg oh I don't thk they are as good as you have better nuclear bombs   than they do this site is called one leap across that's how close North Korea is okay here's the border right across this field this says no drones flyg over the border  look at this warng do not converse or exchange objects with people on the other side  the border they told us to be careful  warngs not to irritate the North Koreans  don't even try crossg appearg across glimpses  what appears to be normal life mundane but hypnotic at the same time there is way to get even closer efficient qui m'a this is a fast boat so I guess we're gonna go over the le to to North Korea from here back  forth you says it's a it's an unclear le  the middle  the river but this river is split  on this side North Korea on that side let's see if we run  any military the capta tells us we've technically entered North Korean waters [] so none  this should we can't shoot is [] [] so this right here is where all the the generals houses are so it's kd  a joke they said if there's a conflict some kd  war that they can get a lot faster than  than the rest [] maja now all around us another surprisg sight North Korean boats filled with North Korean products gseng kimchi alcohol  cigarettes a sort  floatg dutyfree store cash only the other tourists  our boat were ready to shop you can see the shoes sellg thgs right f the beach ship North Korea you can buy your cigarettes a lot cheaper but certaly not very safe all the money from this goes back to her to the people on shore back to the government ficial ficially all right so we're told this is a pretty fancy North Korean restaurant with North Korean waitresses very North Korean entertament an estimated 0,000 North Koreans work here  the dong dong area  send cash back directly to the North Korean government one  the highest prile jobs waitress  performers  North Korean restaurants the kdly ass is not the videotape the waitress told us they live  work   without their families for three years with the promise  gettg better jobs  Pyongyang when they get back but just outside  dong dong the symbiotic relationship starts to show signs  frayg so just headg south  dong dong headg to the was called the new district this is where a br new bridge is beg under construction for the last seven years or so but it's just almost stopped it's slowed down  it's probably because  Kim jongun when the new leader came to power this was his father's project  it's just the buildgs are not completely filled struction is not what they thought it was gog to be people are sayg this is a catastrophe we meet Shg to John a truck driver who used to trade with North Korean farmers  most recently helped  the construction  the new bridge he moved his family to this new district which was built at 700,000 new residents but only a quarter  that has shown up so he's gonna take us now to his buildg where there were about 2,000 rooms that were supposed to be filled so we'll see what what his life is here  this new district North Korea over there well if you go through this hole yet haha North Korea everywhere so you're you're able to see normal North Korean people we we can never leave Pyongyang Kim Jong Hyun is testg so many nuclear bombs  launchg missiles is there much fear here look I do die jeollado zombie this to me on Jan do you thk he thought yeah how many back to that Yan ji devera cost yeah leave the Tong fish on it Tommy yeah you wanna do sentido boy stop wish you 100 or 10 so what do you thk will happen  this new district if if this relationship with   North Korea comes back to normal sometimes you know you know you your w do more with you their new autumn with head out with you the bridge is not opened yet oh you bet you do look at this bridge this is supposed to be the great dream this is gonna step up the relationship between these two countries   North Korea but it's just not openg there's 350 million dollar project built by the Chese was expected to hle 50,000 people  20,000 vehicles a day it now sits as a bridge to nowhere literally satellite pictures show that that bridge abruptly ends on the North Korean side  a dirt field why why is it takg so long to open this bridge where the teens who are children attendg a tea know how happy you either you either w here Jang songthaek was kim jong un's uncle the one he brutally executed  2013 for treason Jon championed closer economic tegration with  at openg up North Korea's economy this bridge was supposed to be the lchp shakeela citizen yet on the Odyssey via an employee [] see that watchtower that's where the North Koreans are starg at the Chese  the Chese have their video cameras on that tower right there to look at the North Koreans as we drive north  dong dong an unexpected scene the Chese military trag on the river with bridgg exercises guards lg the road to keep people from stoppg a remder that there are 150,000 Chese troops stationed along this border with their supposed ly 's biggest fear is that our regime collapse would brg refugees floodg over this border  usbacked South Korean troops right up to it there's a new great wall it was existg back  the 15th century but it went down they built  1992 aga as a as tourism so they say it's about 160 yards up to the top  this mounta  hopefully we'll be able to look out over the Yellow River scene  North Korea [] Nicosia rule yellow never hurt students we de on her oh yeah so right here this is this farm area right here is uh that is North Korea so this is absolutely the best view we've seen so far you can see there's the Yellow River right on that side are all the buildgs the successful economy    then this is North Korea there's nothg but l agriculture  buildgs so this is a this is just gorgeous you're afraid  these nuclear bombs that kill mutes developg thank you thank you I wish I ever dangerous reason so what do you thk we can do about it can we stop him from dog this peaceful solution yeah peaceful solution whenever so long someone's lookg for your total knockout we thk this is dangerous very different very strange so your nessam a way they're not some way  that position you heard I know we have Guardian you some work a salut y'all let me know what you do or more yeah oh yeah get some way how you eat dry years about okay I'm not talkg at each end edges I'd say the D versus all yeah so I'm gonna stop so ready I'm not for the wood doesn't your neck it what do any  you  this area I thk there could be some kd  war other than what I knew all  us you need saucers don't push you on good luck thank you our next stop is G on an ancient Korean capital now on the Chese side  the border this place is bigger than I thought it was gonna be unlike dondon't tourism appears to have come to a halt  this town okay so this is Jian I mean you just look across the river you wonder white why can't they just swim over it's so close there's no cops there's no police why don't they just come over here  get on the kd  dock  walk to freedom [] there have been defectors here but the border is tighteng  sends back any defectors they catch it was a farmer right down here I mean you feel like you're back  then  the 1930s  North Korea punishes the defectors entire family I don't thk you see those kd  plows much anymore you never see any  those  the United States this is another one to see the difference so there's  on this side  there's North Korea on the other you know you see the difference  wealth as we peer across the Yalu a man who claims to be an outwork tour guide approaches us with an fer so this guy told us that they just stopped the oneday tour is for tourists to come  go over to North Korea sit for the last 5 days because  the tension they're not allowg anybody to go over to North Korea he says he can take us close to it but we'll see it's we've had about 12 kilometers down the street to the very edge  Jeon  that's where the bridges that goes over to the other country I'm no idea this guy [] okay so we're gog down underneath huh is he openg the gate I say he say he's claimg that he's sneakg us  underneath the bridge just a secret baby just is it bizarre this guy's got a mysterious where he's takg us what is this like a secret place do you know any defectors that have ever come here oh yeah do you ever get over them you can go there though man yeah boobala so he a't usually not gog on yeah well what is what is the tension is this tension because  the the nuclear tests III sorry people I'm the the Americans more than the North Koreans for stoppg this tourism to Austria yeah see I knew from our defy me I'm gonna call you nervous about to beg terviewed oh yeah every year the annual jot military exercises between the u.s.  South Korea sends North Korea to a defensive frenzy Yong Yong the drills just over their southern border justifies their chasg missile  nukes at all costs  turn the Chese fault the drills for settg f North Korea I would say this is two football fields away from North Korea love to know who's  that nerves apparently call me the tour guide fers to take us further to the new bridge  town I know I say it's everythg that even even here   they're blamg the United States for this tension almost as if it has nothg to do with North Korea we could see that down  down dome where we just were there was there's tourism gog back  forth there was a lot  trade we saw the trucks we saw the tras this might be completely different this further north the importance People's    but this is the bridge right here okay we're gonna get out here so was he concerned about the police tom  the country yeah we do that's a prison right there please hold on can you fd out who Jenny reportg from Paul this way kim jongm built this bridge but why did Kim German want to build this bridge for a war get ready for the war is that what Kim jongun said what do you hear that from he tells us his friends  the Chese military told him about the bridge what she says is just wide enough for two tanks to go across at the same time it's meant for the North Korean generals to get over the border if the war breaks out once we get back  our vans the tour guide speeds f so let's say there's a military zone so we should probably get out  here so we just walk about a thous yards along this tra rail you'll end up  North Korea as we leave the tra tracks we get spotted by the Chese army outpost  the distance so I guess it came true with the military I came out  they stopped us  take us side to their headquarters  they told us that we're  the military area  so we shouldn't be there but then they ultimately let us go they didn't take any  our recordgs so I thk we're good to go but we're just gonna head up to another town to stay tonight stead  stayg  Jeon so we'll see what happens next drivg north we reached the source  the Yellow River Mount paektu so we're go to the top  the mounta now this is perhaps the most sacred place for all Koreans the border here is split by this immense volcano known as Cheung by Shan  Chese  peck busan  korean it is known as the spiritual home  the korean people every day when north korea state TV starts its programmg the national anthem plays agast images  mount paektu  the sacred lake Chon which sits  its vast crater the volcano looms everpresent  the daily lives  North Koreans so much so that after their successful ICBM launch  July news  its success was announced agast the backdrop  none other than Mount paektu testifyg  the tercontental ballistic rocket pass on 1 successful  fact the rulg Kim family derives their legitimacy from the mounta kim jong un's grfather  father are ten depicted stg on top  Mount paektu their endurg myth says the sacred blood  Mount paektu runs through the ves  the Kim family  therefore they are the rightful chosen leaders  the Korean people so we joed the busloads  tourists to hike to the top  the volcano it is accordg to mythology this is where the first kg  the korean kgdom began he was born here also kim ilsung fought back the Japanese turned to his son Kim jongil they say was born here although it should be said that the real records say that he was probably born  the Soviet Union but fally there's a very popular folk song [] [] [] [] [] [] [] you from South Korea South Korea what do you thk about this oh yeah many  the tourists here are from South Korea they only have access to their sacred mounta here on the  side whether you're  the north  the South  North Korea this is me where North Korea the rest  you Chese tourists [] so there's this story  North Korea that when Kim jongil died the ice  this lake cracked  it was so loud that it shook heaven  earth [] so that's the le that goes between this creature   North Korea right there turn f did I tell you the other thg I see from North Korea over there he's on that Ridge down from the peak a little buildg sce about a hundred miles just over this Ridge to North Korea they say that there that's where the location is for one  the nuclear test sites they've actually felt that when they sg so close what's it like to be here right next to North Korea what for the first time I see the site yeah well how do you feel very excitg  one wonderful for one person will Korea  said but is that someday will be one Korea aga North Korea [] [] [] leavg Mount paektu the border is now formed by the Tumen River so the signs they'll have both Chese  we enter 's predomantly Korean region half  's two million ethnic Koreans live  this region  this is Yong Jie their largest city  much to 's chagr this region feels the direct impact from Pyongyang's nuclear testg that breakg news successful nuclear test by North Korea they claimed it overnight South Korea confirms this is just the latest  a series  provocations from North Korea it certaly is rge this overnight test is believed to be the biggest yet last year as it did this September the ground shook here because  what happened just over the border students across Eunji were evacuated out to the open at this high school we met this security guard who felt the shakes it all happened right over here huh what it was you're dancg or like this really evaluate new glories  thoughts forever you know this was their nuclear test I don't know these are yeah cuz see  Saudi there comes with me can you thk there's gonna be another nuclear test on that site he's gonna know so it doesn't was lawyer we turn  head towards the border towards the town  nan pg along the river the Tumen River is shallower  calmer than the Yalu makg it more manageable for defectors sce the mid1990s almost 30,000 North Koreans have fled to    recent years violence  crime have also crossed the border they say that the at the North Korean soldiers are underpaid  underfed  so that's one reason why they've been comg over the river it's Rob the people here      few cases  non pk murder we run to a checkpot he's lookg through all  our bags who they askg for they askg their boss no the security  the national security is actually FBI's it's likely after the state security agent arrives about the border they didn't send any about the killgs this can't be the same right I mean this is this most different than it was months ago even local they keep us on the side  the road for over an hour although they check every vehicle that passes our van was the only one they turn side out after takg pictures  our team  our passports they let us go the ultimate decision was to turn us around send us back to where we came from  not allow us anywhere closer he said further because the border is oh the guy is followg us will they be followg us from it from now on who knows but we're gonna maybe try a different route back to the border  see what's gog as we go further north you know clearly  the south it was pretty easy we were not really stopped by any police or security but now at the further we go north  we get closer to the more pure Korean areas  towns then clearly it's gettg a little bit more difficult they're more sensitive we later learned that just a month earlier seven defectors overpowered North Korean border guards  crossed to  near non pg we make one last attempt for the border  head towards the border town  Tumen named after the river we have yet to see we pass a sign sayg just eight mutes to North Korea this is another region Kim jongun's uncle had hoped to develop with  before his execution this is not far from the Russian border city for 30yard river to get across you know song the Kim Jong Il the posters are on top  that buildg it's the first time we've seen that across the room is the furthest north we've gotten so far it's probably the most narrow River  also most shallow it's the easiest ones to defect cut the Chese flag  they get the North Korean flag sidebyside is that why does she take that part out but once aga they stopped us from shootg the security agent told us we had two choices leave or sightsee with the rest  the tourists no more reportg so we sightsee what we're really seeg is the further we go north  the more strict they become here on the  side  you know the Chese came up to us  said we can't shoot we can't shoot anythg across to the other side if they do the North Koreans do see someone dog this they will compla to the authorities on this side the  side so it's obviously this guy's job to stop us from dog it now we saw people with our cell phones takg video across there everybody said partly because I'm a foreigner that they're even more strict all right we're gettg followed aga this time by this black car I thk probably until we get out  this town so this has been quite a trip I thk we got to wrap it up  head home all these towns are I thk they're gonna be watchg see if we're gonna come sce our trip Kim jongun conducted North Korea's sixth nuclear test  what appears to be open defiance   Beijg has committed two additional rounds  new UN sanctions banng all imports  North Korean coal seafood textiles  now cappg Pyongyang's fuel imports until Beijg decides to really cut f the lifele the trucks will still criss cross the bridge  dondon [] North Korea will still fd a way to send its workers  the empty bridges spanng their border st ready for whatever they were supposedly built for Fears on the Chese side  the border are not over imment war but the disruption  their livelihood 's reluctant tolerance  Kim jongun  the convenience status quo has always been  always will be about stability

11,1.0,"My name is Pressor Michio Kaku. \xa0I\'m a\npressor  theoretical physics at the City   New York  I specialize \nsomethg called strg theory. \xa0I\'m a physicist. Some people ask me the question, ""What has physics done for me lately? \xa0I mean, do I\nget better color television, do I get better ternet reception with physics?"" \xa0And the\nanswer is yes. \xa0You see, physics is at the very foundation  matter  energy. \xa0We\nphysicists vented the laser beam, we vented the transistor. \xa0We helped to create the\nfirst computer. \xa0We helped to construct the ternet. \xa0We wrote the  Wide Web. \xa0In\naddition, we also helped to vent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI\nscans, PET scans, xrays. \xa0In other words, almost everythg you see  your livg room,\nalmost everythg you see  a modern hospital, at some pot or other, can be traced to a\nphysicist. Now, I got terested  physics when I was\na child. When I was eight,\na great scientist had just died. \xa0I still remember my elementary school teacher comg\nto the room  announcg that the greatest scientist  our era has just passed away.\n\xa0And that day, every newspaper published a picture  his desk. \xa0 desk  bert\nEste. \xa0And the caption said, I\'ll never forget, "" unfished manuscript  the\ngreatest work  the greatest scientist  our time."" \xa0And I said to myself, ""Why couldn\'t\nhe fish it? \xa0I mean, what\'s so hard? \xa0It\'s a homework problem, right? \xa0Why didn\'t he\nask his mother? \xa0Why can\'t he fish this problem?"" \xa0So as a child  eight, I decided\nto fd out what was this problem. Years later, I began to realize that it was\nthe theory  everythg, the Unified Field ory. An equation that would summarize\nall the physical forces  the universe. \xa0An equation like E=mc². \xa0That equation is half\nan ch long  that equation unlocks the secret  the stars. \xa0Why do the stars she?\n\xa0Why does the galaxy light up? \xa0Why do we have energy on the earth? But then there was another thg that happened\nto me when I was around eight years old. \xa0I got hooked on the Saturday morng TV shows.\n\xa0In particular, Flash Gordon. \xa0And I was hooked. \xa0I mean, every Saturday morng watchg\nprograms about alien from outer space, star ships, ray guns, visibility shields, cities\n the sky, that was for me. \xa0But after a few years, I began to notice somethg. \xa0First\n all, I began to notice that well, I didn\'t have blond hair  blue eyes, I didn\'t have\nmuscles like Flash Gordon, but it was a scientist who made the series work. \xa0In particular,\na physicist. \xa0He was the one who discovered the ray gun, the star ships.\xa0He was the one who created the visibility shield.\n\xa0And then I realized somethg else. \xa0If you want to underst the future, you have\nto underst physics. \xa0Physics is at the foundation  all the gadgetry, the wizardry,\nall the marvels  the technological age, all  it can be traced to the work  a physicist. \xa0\nPhysics  the Impossible Physics  the Impossible Most  science fiction is  fact well with\nthe laws  physics, but possible with maybe 100 years. \xa0And then we have \nimpossibilities that may take 1,000 years or more. \xa0That cludes time travel, warp\ndrive, higher dimensions, portals through space  time, star gates, worm holes. You know, if you were to meet your grparents\nat the year 1900, they were dirt farmers back then. \xa0y didn\'t live much beyond the age\n 0, on average. \xa0Long distance communication  the year 1900 was yellg at your neighbor.\n\xa0And yet, if they could see you now, with iPads  iPods  satellites  GPS \nlaser beams, how would they view you? \xa0y y would view you as a wizard or sorcerer. However, if we can now meet our grkids\n the year 2100, how would we view them? We would view them as gods, like  Greek\nmythology. \xa0Zeus could control objects around him by pure thought. \xa0Materialize objects\njust by thkg. \xa0And there\'re perks to beg a Greek god, Venus had a perfect body,\na timeless body. \xa0And we are begng now to unravel the genetics at the molecular level,\n the agg process. \xa0And then Apollo, he had a chariot that he could ride across the\nheavens. \xa0We will fally have that flyg car that we\'ve always wanted to have  our garage. By the year 2100,\nwe will have the power  the gods. To paraphrase Arthur C. Clark, ""Any sufficiently\nadvanced technology is distguishable from from divity."" So let\'s now beg our story.  History  Physics  history  physics is the history  modern\ncivilization. \xa0Before Isaac Newton, before Galileo, we were shrouded with the mysteries\n superstition. \xa0People believed  all sorts  different kds  spirits  demons.\n\xa0What made the planets move? \xa0Why do thgs thgs teract with other thgs? \xa0It was a mystery. So, back  the Middle Ages, for example,\npeople read the works  Aristotle. \xa0And Aristotle asked the question, ""Why do objects\nmove toward the earth? \xa0And that\'s because,"" he said, ""objects yearn, yearn to be united\nwith the earth. \xa0\xa0And why do objects slow down when you put them  motion? \xa0Objects\n motion slow down because they get tired."" se are the works  Aristotle, which\nheld sway for almost 2,000 years until the begng  modern physics with Galileo \nIsaac Newton. When the ancients looked at the sky, the\nsky was full  mystery  wonder,   the year 1066, the most important date on\nthe British calendar, there was a comet, a comet which sailed over the battlefield \nHastgs. \xa0It frightened the troops  Kg Harold,  a young man from Normy, swept\nto Engl  defeated Kg Harold at the Battle  Hastgs, creatg the modern British\nmonarchy. But the question is, where did the comet come\nfrom? \xa0What was this comet that mysteriously paved the way for the comg  the British\nmonarchy? Well, believe it or not, that same comet,\nthe very same comet that itiated the British monarchy, sailed over London once aga \n1682. \xa0This time, everyone was askg the question, ""Where do comets come from? \xa0Do\nthey signal the death  the kg? \xa0Why do we have messengers from heavens  the sky?""\n\xa0Well, one man dared to penetrate the secrets  comets,  that was Isaac Newton. \xa0In\nfact, when Isaac Newton was only 23 years old, he stumbled upon the universal force\n gravitation. Accordg to one story, he was walkg on\nhis estate  Woolsthorpe,  he saw an apple fall. \xa0And then Isaac Newton saw the moon,\n then he asked the key question which helped to unlock the heavens. \xa0If apples falls,\ndoes the moon also fall? \xa0And the answer was, ""Yes."" \xa0And answer overturned thouss\n years  mystery  speculation about the motions  the heavens. \xa0 moon is\n freefall, just like an apple. \xa0 moon is constantly fallg toward the earth. \xa0It\ndoesn\'t hit the earth, because it sps around the earth,  the earth is round, but it\'s\nactg under a force, a force  gravity. So Newton immediately tried to work out the\nmathematics  he realized that the mathematics  the 1600\'s was not sufficient to work out\nthe motion  a fallg moon. \xa0So what did Isaac Newton do? \xa0When he was 23 years old,\nnot only did he stumble upon the force  gravity, but he also created calculus. \xa0In\nfact, he created calculus at the rate at which you learn it, when you are a freshman  college.\n\xa0And why did he create calculus? \xa0To calculate the motion  a fallg moon. \xa0 mathematics\n his age was capable  calculatg the trajectories  objects movg under an verse\nsquare force field,  that\'s what Isaac Newton did. \xa0He worked out the motion \nthe moon. \xa0And then he realized that if he understs the moon, he also understs\nthe motion  the planets  the solar system. And Isaac Newton vented a new telescope.\n\xa0It was the reflectg telescope  he was trackg the motion  this comet. Well, it turns out that everyone was talkg\nabout the comet, cludg a rather wealthy Englishman by the name  Edmund Haley. So Edmund Haley, beg a wealthy merchant, decided to make\na trip to Cambridge to talk to Engl\'s illustrious scientist, Sir Isaac Newton. \xa0Well, Edmund\nHaley asked Newton, ""What do you make  this comet? \xa0No one understs comets, they\'re\na mystery. \xa0y\'ve been fascatg people for centuries, for millennia, what are your\nthoughts?"" \xa0And then, I paraphrase, but Isaac Newton said somethg like this, he said,\n""Oh, that\'s easy. \xa0That comet is movg at a perfect ellipse. \xa0It\'s movg  an verse\nsquare force field. \xa0I\'ve been trackg it every day with my reflectg telescope \nthe path  that comet conforms to my mathematics exactly."" \xa0And  course, we don\'t know what\nEdmund Haley\'s reaction was, but I paraphrase, he must have said somethg like this, he\nsaid, ""For God\'s sake, man, why don\'t you publish the greatest work  all  scientific\nhistory? \xa0If correct, you have decoded the secret  the stars, the secret  the heavens.\n\xa0Nobody understs where comets come from."" And then Newton responded  said, ""Oh,\nwell, it costs too much. \xa0I mean, I\'m not a wealthy man, it would cost too much to summarize\nthis calculus that I\'ve vented  to work out all the motion  the stars."" \xa0And then\nHaley must have said this, he must have said, ""Mr. Newton, I am a wealthy man. \xa0I have\nmade my fortune  commerce. \xa0I will pay for the publication  the greatest scientific\nwork  any language."" \xa0And it was Prcipia.  prcipals, the mathematical prcipals\nthat guide the heavens. Believe it or not, this is perhaps one \nthe most important works ever written by a human beg  the 100,000 years sce we\nevolved from Africa. \xa0Realize that this book sets to motion a physics  the universe.\n\xa0Forces that control the motion  the planets, forces which can be calculated, forces which\ngovern the motion  cannonballs, rockets, pebbles, everythg that moves, moves accordg\nto the laws  motion  the calculus  Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, even today, when we launch our space\nprobes, we don\'t use Este\'s equations, they only apply when you get near the speed\n light or near a black hole. \xa0We use Newton\'s laws  gravity. \xa0y are so precise that\nwhen we shoot a space probe right past the rgs  Saturn, we use exactly the same equations\nthat Isaac Newton unraveled  the 1600\'s. That\'s why we have glorious photographs\n the rgs  Saturn. \xa0That\'s why we have flyby\'s right past Neptune. \xa0That\'s why\nwe\'ve been able to unravel the secrets  the solar system, compliments  the laws\n motion  Isaac Newton. So what Newton did was not only did he set\nto motion the ability to calculate planets, he also set to motion a mechanics. \xa0Maches\nnow operated upon welldefed laws: Newton\'s three laws  motion. \xa0 first law  motion\nsays that objects  motion stay  motion forever, unless acted on by an outside force.\n\xa0You see that  an ice skatg rk. \xa0You should a puck  it goes all the way down\nforever, unless acted upon by an outside force. That\'s different from Aristotle\'s law \nmotion. \xa0Aristotle said, ""Objects  motion eventually stop, because they get tired.""  second law  motion says, force is mass\ntimes acceleration. \xa0And that equation made possible the Industrial Revolution. \xa0Steam\nenges, locomotives, factories, maches, all  it due to the mechanics set to motion\nby Isaac Newton\'s second law  motion, force is equal to mass times acceleration. And then Newton had a third law  motion.\n\xa0For every action, there\'s an equal  opposite reaction, that\'s the law  rockets. \xa0That\'s\nwhy we have rockets that can sail to outer space. which could have been calculated by Isaac\nNewton himself. So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel\nthe first force  the universe, gravity, that number, 25,000 miles per hour, that\'s\nthe escape velocity  the earth, a number So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel\nthe first force  the universe, gravity, that set to motion the Industrial Revolution.\n\xa0A revolution which toppled the kgs  queens  Europe, which displaced feudalism,\nusherg  the modern age. \xa0l because a 23yearold gentleman looked up  asked\nthe question, ""Does the moon also fall?"" You know, when I was a kid growg up  California,\nI would see pictures  the Empire State Buildg. And I said to myself, ""How could that possibly\nbuild such a big buildg  not know that it\'s gog to fall? \xa0I mean, why doesn\'t\nit fall? \xa0y didn\'t build scale models  the thg, you couldn\'t have an Empire\nState Buildg that big to test whether it\'s gog to fall or not. \xa0How did they know\nahead  time that that buildg wouldn\'t fall? \xa0And the answer is: \xa0Newton\'s laws\n motion. In fact, today, I teach Newton\'s laws  motion,\n you can actually calculate the forces on every sgle brick  the empire state\nbuildg, usg Newton\'s second law  motion, force is mass\ntimes acceleration. When Newton unraveled\nthe force  gravity, that was the first force. Now, let\'s take a look at the\nsecond force, an even greater force which has touched all  our lives,  that is\nthe electromagnetic force. Ever sce humans saw lightng bolts light\nup the sky, ever sce they were terrified by the sound  thunder, they\'ve been askg,\n""Do the gods propel lighteng bolts  create thunder? \xa0Are they angry at us?"" Scientists began to\nrealize that the lightng bolts  the thunder can be duplicated on the earth. \xa0That\nwe can actually create mi lightng bolts usg electricity. But it wasn\'t until the 1800\'s that fally\nwe beg to unlock the second great force which rules the universe, the electromagnetic\nforce. Michael Faraday would give Christmas lectures  London, fascatg everyone from\nadults to children. \xa0And he would demonstrate the credible properties  electricity. Some people, for example, ask a simple question.\n\xa0If you\'re  a car or an airplane, you get hit by a lighteng bolt, why don\'t you all\nget electrocuted? \xa0Why don\'t you all die? Well, Faraday answered the question. \xa0He\nwould create a cage.\xa0He would walk to this steel cage, electrify it, \nhe wouldn\'t get electrocuted at all. \xa0That\'s called a Faraday cage  every time you walk\nto \xa0metal structure, you get shielded by this metal object. Well, what Michael Faraday did was, he helped to unleash the second great revolution\nwith somethg calls Faraday\'s Law. A movg wire  a magnetic\nfield, has this electrons pushed, creatg an electrical current. That simple idea unleashed the electric revolution. And that\'s why we have hydroelectric generators, dams that produce enormous amounts  power, That\'s why people build nuclear power plants. That\'s why we have electricity  this room right now! On a very small scale, you use that  your\nbicycle. \xa0When you put a bicycle lamp on your bicycle, the turng  the wheel sps\na magnet. \xa0 magnet then pushes electrons  a wire  that\'s why electricity lights\nup  your bicycle lamp. So  other words, electricity  magnetism were unified to\na sgle force. \xa0We once thought that electricity  magnetism were separate. \xa0Now we know\nthey are  fact the same force. So if a movg magnet can create an electric\nfield, this means that a movg electric field can create a magnetic field. \xa0But if they\ncan create each other, why can\'t they oscillate  create a wave? \xa0So that movg electric\nfields create magnetic fields, create electric fields, create magnetic fields, fitum\nto create a wave? Well, around the time  the American Civil\nWar, a mathematical physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, calculated, usg the work  Faraday,\nthe velocity  this wave. And  one  the greatest breakthroughs\n all time, James Clerk Maxwell calculated the velocity  this wave  found out it\nwas the velocity  light. \xa0And then he made this credible discovery: this is light.\n\xa0That\'s what light is. \xa0It doesn\'t by accident travel at the speed  electricity, it is\nlight itself. wave,  that wave is called light. And the equations were written down by James\nClerk Maxwell. \xa0Unfortunately, Michael Faraday And the equations were written down by James\nClerk Maxwell. \xa0Unfortunately, Michael Faraday himself did not have a formal education. \xa0He\ncould not put to mathematical form his own work. \xa0James Clerk Maxwell was a theoretical\nphysicist, just like myself. \xa0He wrote down the mathematical physics  oscillatg electric\nfields  magnetic fields  they are called Maxwell\'s equations. \xa0se equations have\nto be memorized by every physicist  grad school. \xa0You cannot get your PhD without\nmemorizg these equations. \xa0Every engeer deals with radar  radio has to memorize these equations. \xa0And so, if you go to Berkley,\nwhere I got my PhD, you can buy a tshirt which says, ""In the begng God said, the\nfourdimensional divergence  an antisymmetric, second rank tensor equals zero,  there\nwas light. Ladies  gentlemen, this\nis the equation for light.  light, we physicists today want to have\na one ch equation that summarize all physical reality. Well, Michael Faraday  his own lifetime\nwas heralded as a great scientist,  how many scientists do you know appear on money?\n\xa0Well, there he is, on the British 20pound note. \xa0So it\'s very rare that a scientist\nappears on a nation\'s currency, but so great was a contribution  Michael Faraday that\nthere he is on the 20pound note. \xa0\xa0\n Electromagnetic Revolution\xa0  Nuclear Age  consequences  the electromagnetic revolution\ntouch all  us. \xa0This is a picture  the  consequences  the electromagnetic revolution\ntouch all  us. \xa0This is a picture  the earth from outer space. \xa0Look at this picture.\n\xa0Europe electrified, you can actually see the fruits  all  our efforts to create\nelectricity, to energize our lives,  one picture, seeg the earth from outer space.\n\xa0So let\'s now talk about how Faraday  Maxwell\'s work touches your life as well. This is the ternet. \xa0 ternet is a\nsimple byproduct  the electromagnetic force. And\nyou can see that where there is the ternet, there is prosperity. \xa0re is science, there\'s\nentertament, there\'s economic activity. Where there\'s no ternet, there\'s poverty.\n\xa0And  the future, the ternet will be miaturized  it will be placed  your\nglasses. \xa0Your glasses will recognize people\'s faces  display their biography next to\nthe image as you talk to them,  then when they speak Chese to you, your glasses will\ntranslate Chese to English  prt out subtitles right beneath their image. \xa0So\n the future, you will know exactly who you are talkg to without even talkg to them,\n this means that at a cocktail party, if you\'re lookg for a job, but you don\'t know\nwho the heavy hitters are,  the future you will know exactly who to suck up to. In the future, chips will only cost a penny, because we can manufacture tier  tier transistors You will have Faraday\'s electromagnetic force side your body This is a pill. It has a chip  it.  chip is smaller than an aspir pill, It also has a TV camera  a magnet. When you swallow it, the magnet guides the camera, takg pictures  your stomach, your testes, because we all know what middleaged men fear the most: colonoscopies. And, this gives new meang for the expression ""tel side."" Now, let\'s talk about the next great forces\nwhich rule the universe. \xa0We talked about gravity, which allows us to calculate the\nmotion  the planets. \xa0 mechanics created by Newton helped to unleash the Industrial\nRevolution. \xa0Michael Faraday worked out the electromagnetic force, which gave us the wonders\n the electric age. \xa0And now, let\'s talk about the nuclear age, the stars  the sun.\n\xa0People have been fascated by the sun, Apollo was the god that strode across the\nheavens  his fiery chariot. \xa0But hey, when you calculate how long coal or oil will burn\nlike the sun, you realize that  just a few hundred years, the sun would burn to a crisp.\n\xa0So what could possibly last for billions  years? \xa0re must be a new force, a nuclear\nforce. Este  others helped to unravel the\nsecret  the stars. \xa0 nuclear force comes  two types, weak  strong. \xa0 weak nuclear force governs radioactive decay.  strong nuclear force is one  the strongest forces  the entire universe. It\'s so strong it holds our protons together, ever sce Genesis, the begng  time.  equation which allows for the liberation  energy is Este\'s famous equation E=mc². What Este showed was that the faster you move, the heavier you get. So your weight is not a constant. When you move very rapidly you get heavier, somethg which we measure every day  the laboratory. Now, this means\nthat the energy  motion transformed to mass, because you get heavier. \xa0Now, listen\ncarefully. \xa0 faster you move, the heavier you get. \xa0Which means that the energy \nmotion, ""E"" turns to ""m"", your mass. \xa0And the relationship between E  m is very simple,\nit takes one second to write it down on a sheet  paper, it is exactly E=mc². So the nuclear force helped to expla the\nsecret  the sun. \xa0But it also created a Pora\'s box, because side the nucleus\n the atom, are particles. \xa0And when you smash these particles, what do you get? \xa0More\nparticles. \xa0And when you smash them, what More particles. In fact, we are drowng  subatomic particles. Hundreds, thouss  subatomic particles every time\nwe smash atoms. Now, we smash atoms usg somethg called atom smashers, or particle accelerators. I built my own particle accelerator when I was  high school. When I was  high school, I went to my mom one day  I said, ""Can\nI have permission to build a 2.3 million electron volt betatron particle accelerator  the\ngarage?"" \xa0And my mom said, ""Sure, why not? And don\'t forget to take out the garbage!"" And as a high school kid I asked for 00 pounds  transformer steel. I asked for 22 miles  cooper wire. Because I wanted to create a six kilowatter, 10,000 gauss magnetic field, to energize my atom smasher. With 22 miles  copper wire, how could you wd it? We did it on the high school football field. With 22 miles  copper wire on the goalpost, gave it to my mother, she ran to the 50 yard le unravelg the spool  wire, she gave it to my father who then ran to the goalpost  we wound 22 miles  copper wire on the high school football field. Well, fally my atom smasher was ready. It consumed six kilowatts  power, that\'s every sgle ounce  power my house could deliver. I plugged my ears, I closed my eyes, I turned on the power,  I heard this huge cracklg sound as six kilowatts  power surged through my capacitor bank  then I heard a ""pop pop pop"" sound as I blew out every sgle circuit breaker  the house.  whole house was plunged  darkness. My poor mom, every time she\'d come home she\'d see the lights flicker  die. And she must\'ve wondered ""why couldn\'t I have a son who plays baseball?"" Why can\'t he learn basket ball? And for god\'s sake why can\'t he fd a nice Japanese girl?"" I mean, why does he have to build these maches  the garage? Well, these maches that I built  my garage earned the attention  a physicist Edward Teller, father  the hydrogen bomb. And he arranged for me to get a scholarship to . And my career got a head start! He knew exactly what I was dog. I didn\'t have to expla to him that I was experimentg with antimatter. I was creatg antielectrons  my mom\'s garage,  usg atom smashers to eventually create beams  antimatter. Antimatter is the opposite  matter. It has an opposite charge. So an electron has negative charge.  positron, or antielectron, has positive charge. This means that you can now create antimolecules  antiatoms. Antihydrogen was made at CERN, outside Geneva, Switzerl And also at Fermilab outside Chicago Where you have antielectrons circulatg around antiprotons. And  Brookhaven ional Laboratory on Long Isl just recently they detected antihelium! We have two antiprotons with two antineutrons to create antihelium. For every piece  matter there is a counterpart made out  antimatter. And when the two collide, by the way, it releases the greatest energy source  the universe. It is 100 percent conversion  matter to energy by Este\'s equations E=mc squared. Inside the nucleus  the atom we have particles upon particles when you smash them apart. In the 1950\'s we were drowng  subatomic particles. In fact, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father  the atomic bomb, once made a statement. He declared that ""the Nobel Prize  physics should go to the physicist who does not discover a new particle this year."" That how many particles were beg discovered. So, let\'s talk about the Particle Zoo. Right now, we physicists have unlocked hundreds, thouss  subatomic particles. And we\'ve been able to piece them together to a jigsaw puzzle. It\'s called the ""stard model."" It has 36 quarks, 19 free parameters, 3 generations  quarks no rhyme, no reason, but this is the most fundamental basis  reality that we physicists have been able to construct. Billions  dollars. 20 Nobel prizes. have gone to the creation  the stard model.  it is the ugliest theory known to science, but it works. re\'s one piece missg,  that one piece missg is called the HiggsBoson. We expect to fd it. We want to create a higher version  this theory  that theory, we thk, is strg theory. Strg theory is based on the simple idea that all the four forces  the universe Gravity, electromagnetic force,  the two nuclear forces, can be viewed as .   ty little rubber bs. So if I had a super microscope,  I could look right to the heart  an electron What would I see? I would see a vibratg rubber b. And if I ""twang"" it, it turns to a neutro. I ""twang"" it aga  it turns to a quark. I ""twang"" it aga  it turns to a YangMills particle In fact, if I ""twang"" it enough times, I get thouss  subatomic particles that have been cataloged patiently by physicists. Strg theory, we thk, is a theory  everythg. Now, strg theory,  turn, can be summarized  an equation about an ch long That\'s my equation! This is called strg field theory. And how will we test it? We are buildg a mache.  biggest mache  science ever built  the history  the human race. Outside Geneva, Switzerl. It is the Large Hadron Collider. So the HiggsBoson, we thk, will be created by the Large Hadron Collider. A tube 17 miles  circumference with two beams  protons circulatg  opposite directions n slammg together creatg a shower  particles,  among these particles we hope to fd the HiggsBoson, but not only that. We hope to fd particles even beyond the HiggsBoson.  next set  particles beyond the HiggsBoson are ""sparticles""  next layer  the jigsaw puzzle are called sparticles—super particles Nothg but higher vibrations, higher al notes  a vibratg strg. And what else can we do? We can also unlock secrets  the big bang. You see, Este\'s equations break down  the stant  the big b  the center  a black hole.  two most terestg places  the universe are beyond our reach usg Este\'s equations. We need a higher theory,  that\'s where strg theory comes . Strg theory takes you before the  Bang, before Genesis itself. And what does strg theory say? It says that there is a multiverse  universes. Where did the  Bang come from? Well, Este\'s equations give us this compellg picture that we are like sects on a soap bubble. A gigantic soap bubble which is expg.  we are trapped like flies on fly paper, we can\'t escape the soap bubble  that\'s called the  Bang ory. Strg theory says there should be other bubbles out there  a multiverse  bubbles. When two universes collide it can form another universe. When a universe splits  half it can create two universes,  that, we thk, is the  Bang.   Bang is caused by either the collision  universes or by the fissiong  universes. If there are other dimensions, if there are other universes, can we go between universes? Well that,  course, is very hard, but ice  Wonderl gives us a possibility that maybe one day we might create a wormhole between universes. This is a wormhole.   takg a sheet  paper  puttg two dots on it.  shortest distance between two pots is a straight le. But if I can fold, if I can fold that sheet  paper n perhaps I can create a shortcut. A shortcut through space  time, called a wormhole. This is a genue solution  Este\'s equations. We can actually see this  strg theory.  question is: how practical is it to go through one  these thgs? We don\'t know. In fact there\'s a debate among physicists today, Stephen Hawkg, many physicists are jumpg to the game  tryg to figure out whether it\'s physically possible to go all the way through a wormhole. Because if you could, then you might be able to use this as a time mache. Sce strg theory is a theory  everythg, it\'s also a theory  time. And time maches are allowed  Este\'s equations, but to build one is extremely difficult. Far more energy is required than a simple Delorean with plutonium. You know, trillions  years from now the universe is gog to get awfully cold. We thk the universe is headed for a big freeze. Stars will blk out, stars will cease to twkle,  the universe will be so big it\'ll be very cold. At that pot all telligent life  the universe must die.  laws  physics are a death warrant for all telligent life. re is only one way to escape the death  the universe,  that is leave the universe. We are now enterg the realm  science fiction, but at least now we have equations equations  strg theory which will now allow us to calculate if it is possible to go through a wormhole, to go to another universe where it\'s warmer,  perhaps we can start all over aga. If you were to summarize the march  physics through the last 10,000 years it would be the distillation  the laws  nature to four fundamental forces. Gravity, electricity  magnetism,  the two nuclear forces. But then the question is ""is there a fifth force?"" A force beyond the forces we can measure  the laboratory. And believe it or not there are physicists who have looked very carefully for a fifth force. Some people thk maybe it\'s psychic phenomena. Maybe it\'s telepathy. Maybe it\'s somethg called psi power. Maybe it\'s the power  the md. Maybe consciousness! Well, I\'m a physicist. We believe  testg theories to make sure they are falsifiable  reproducible. We want to make sure that on dem your theory works every sgle time without exception. And if your theory fails one time, It\'s wrong. In other words, Este\'s theory has to work every sgle time without exception. One time Este\'s theory is proven to be wrong, the whole theory is wrong. Well, so far we can reproduce these four physical theories, but a fifth theory cannot be reproduced. We\'ve looked for it. Some people thk that maybe a fifth force may be short range. Like, not over the nucleus  an atom, but rangg over several feet. And we can\'t fd any. We physicists  the last ten years have discovered a new energy source larger than the galaxy itself. Dark energy. Realized  our universe today 73 percent  our universe, matter  energy, 73 percent is  the form  dark energy.  energy  nothg! That\'s what\'s blowg the galaxies farther  farther apart. That\'s the energy  the  Bang itself. Kids ask the question, ""If the universe banged, what made it bang?"" And the answer is dark energy. 73 percent  the universe\'s energy is dark energy. 23 percent is dark matter. Dark matter is visible matter. If I held it  my h it would go right through my h. It holds the galaxy together. 23 percent  the universe is dark matter. Stars made out  hydrogen  helium make up four percent  the universe. And then what about us? We, the higher elements. We made out  oxygen, carben, nitrogen, tungsten, iron We make up .03 percent  the universe. In other words, we are the exception.  universe is maly made out  dark energy.  universe is maly made out  dark matter. Overwhelmg the stars, overwhelmg the galaxies  fact. Now what is dark matter, which makes up 23 percent  the universe? No one knows. Strg theory gives us a clue, but there\'s no defitive answer. So  other words, for you young aspirg physicists out there  the audience, You may be sayg to yourself right now, ""Why should I go to physics? Because you guys already have a cidate for the unified field theory, right? Just realize that every sgle physics textbook is WRONG. Every sgle physics textbook on the Earth says that the universe is maly made out  atoms Right? re it is!  universe is maly made out  atoms. Wrong! In the past ten years we have come to the realization that most  the universe is dark. And there\'s a whole shelf full  Nobel Prizes for the young people who can figure out the secret  dark matter  dark energy. Let me give some advice to you if you are a young physicist, perhaps just gettg out  high school You have dreams  beg Este, you have dreams  workg on strg theory  thgs like that  then you hit freshman physics. Let me be blunt: We physicists flunk most student takg elementary physics. And we\'re more or less encouraged to do so by the engeerg department. We don\'t want to tra engeers who make bridges that fall down. We don\'t want to create engeers that create skyscrapers that fall over. re\'s a bottom le: you have to know the laws  mechanics. So before you can work with the laws  Este, you have to work with\nthe laws  friction, levers, pulleys \ngears. As a consequence we have a very high flunkout rate  elementary physics. So if you\'re a young physicist graduatg from high school with stars  your eyes,  you encounter freshman physics for the first time, watch out! If you have a rough time, that\'s the way it is. I started out my life as an experimental physicist. n I went to   then I talked to my adviser, one  the world\'s greatest experiment physicists, Pressor Pound And he told me maybe it\'s time to give it a rest. He said to me, ""Your skills are much better suited to what you love the most, which is theory."" ""Mathematics.  world  higher dimensions."" And I realized that he was probably right.  thg about physics, or science that really trigues me the most is to fd the most fundamental basis for everythg Rather than tryg to massage a theory, or make a theory prettier, Why not fd out why it works? What makes it tick? And that\'s what I do for a livg. I\'m a theoretical physicist. Thank you very much!"
12,0.0,here's a scary thought what if we can't stop climate change most  the talk about climate change has been about reducg the emissions we're gog to make but what about the emissions we've already made so if we cut all emissions to zero tomorrow it could be that the world still warms up quite a lot over this century because  what are called carbon feedbacks sce the begng  the Industrial Revolution we've already added 531 billion tons  carbon emissions to the atmosphere that has led to a roughly one  a half degree rise  average global surface temperatures so far which  turn is causg ice caps to melt sea levels to rise  has been lked to extreme droughts  storms we need to have technologies which allow us to have a high stard  livg while beg  carbon balances  we have done it with clean air  this country  I thk we can also do it with stoppg climate change cleang up our existg nests is gog to be hard expensive  controversial but it's also gog to be necessary fortunately some people are already figurg out how we'll do it Klaus Lackner  his colleagues want us to rethk our relationship with carbon dioxide here at Arizona State 's Center for negative carbon emissions they see it as a waste management problem this is like sewage this is like garbage  you cannot just dump it  the atmosphere  I'll give you an example if I were to dump my garbage  the street  front  my house got my neighborhood you would object  you wouldn't thk it was all that cool on my part to come back to you the next day  say I ternally improved my efficiencies  I'm happy to announce that I'm only

for the co2 already  our atmosphere Lackner is workg on a technology to actually suck co2 out  the sky he started his research by lookg at a device that already does this pretty well  a way it all started with trees right the question is can you pull co2 out  the atmosphere  you look at a tree  the answer is yes you can he wants to make a synthetic version that works even better certaly you can pull up plow over the horse but you're better f gettg a tractor this is his tractor Lackner steam has been workg on different versions  this technology for more than a decade the key component is this papery material which is embedded with a res that can absorb carbon dioxide from the air our take on this material  our twist  our discovery is that it also has a strong affity for carbon dioxide especially when it's  a dry state now I have sort  a spoon I can grab the co2  it crucially the material also lets go  co2 dunk it  water or expose it to high humidity  it releases the carbon dioxide for collection it can be pumped underground fed to greenhouses or to algae for biuel or perhaps  the future even used to make carbonbased materials once the co2 is gone you can dry the membrane  the air  reuse it Lackner expects the material will work for thouss  cycles this particular piece  material is probably 10 years old  it's workg just fe right now the lab is workg on different designs to maximize the materials contact with air so this was just the material run through a pasta maker kd  thg that rug  there was literally woven by some poor undergrads this was a bit  a reality check to see if  fact this accordion idea would work   fact it does black nurse data suggests the material soundly beats nature  capturg carbon from the atmosphere you have an object the size  this tree made out  our material we roughly collect a thous times as much co2 we  a given amount  time to suck up the amount  co2 humans are currently emittg would require a massive number  synthetic trees  that's the scale  cleanup Lackner is terested  this is the mockup Lackner  his colleagues created to show what their device would look like if implemented on a large scale  fits to a stard shippg contaer  if you wanted to balance current emissions you would need a hundred million contaers that's not a small footprt it's not a quick fix  the technology isn't cheap but neither were solar panels  wdmills when they were first developed on an optimistic note when I started this  1995 people just thought is crazy even to work on it  that that has changed dramatically critics  this technology argued that the ability to scrub co2 from the atmosphere might weaken our will to stop usg fossil fuels but the damage has already been done  it needs fixg sooner rather than later we have done it on ozone we have done it on rivers yeah we have the same thg  it's only a question  how much does it have to hurt before we make this step the danger is by the time it hurts it's too late blockg out the Sun sounds like the plot  a Bond villa but for David Keith a physicist at   it's not a plot to destroy the planet it's about to save it Keith is researchg solar geoengeerg that's the proposal to spray ty reflective particles to the upper atmosphere bouncg sunlight back to space  lowerg global temperatures this technology might be able to quickly cool the earth if thgs get devastatgly humped I don't thk we know enough now to say that we should do it I thk  fact it would be lunacy to argue that we should start right now but what I do thk is there's enough evidence that it could have enormous benefits benefits  many cases to the poorest  most vulnerable the old the world will be most affected by climate change that we ought to have a serious research program but we don't  does  there are some research programs  Europe but  America just advocatg for geoengeerg research is very controversial the kd  ficial u.s. position is ignorance which is really disturbg people on the side  the community will say it's reckless to research this or talk about it because it will weaken the political force to cut emissions  I thk that really misconceives the job  science if we actually thk these technologies can reduce risks it's our duty to say so obviously it's impossible to get approval  the u.s. to ject particles to the stratosphere to measure what happens so keeps lab is built a ty atmosphere  its bone for testg specifically the glass tube that you see  here is a simulation  the stratosphere we can simulate these very cold temperatures  the stratosphere we can also put UV lamps around this that simulate the sunlight conditions  the stratosphere the goal is to fd materials that can effectively reflect light while not damagg the atmosphere we will look at Diamond dust as one  the potential cidates yes it is the diamonds  the sky experiment the leap from lab experiment to deployg this worldwide is a large one  that's not lost on Keith no amount  research on this technology will remove the uncertaties the fact is we've put now for a hundred years an enormous amount  co2  the atmosphere  we still don't know the climate's response to co2 accurate because the climate is a noisy beast if we engeerg the Earth's atmosphere sounds a bit extreme to you you're not alone even though we accidentally messed up the climate some feel fixg it by deliberately manipulatg the climate could have unknown consequences ones worse than our current problem it's a deep question why people seem to be more concerned about deliberate tkerg that actually aims to reduce environmental risks then they are about all sorts  hideous ways we damage the environment Solar geoengeerg would work quickly  cheaply but it's not a permanent solution it addresses the symptoms  climate change not the causes but if our efforts to cut carbon emissions don't work fast enough it may be our only option I thk it's very fair to thk  this as a bad date or a kludge but baids aren't a bad thg if you're wounded you want baids it's somethg that is imperfect that doesn't deal with a root cause but might substantially reduce the risks you
13,0.0,"entrepreneur Mark Cuban never calls time out I always look at busess as a sport  football you play 60 mutes basketball you play 8 mutes  busess it's 2 by 7 by 365  the whole world's tryg to kick your ass I will never forget talkg to mark about you know where are you gog with this broadcast thg  he goes I'm gog to the  billionaire boys club Mark Cuban parlayed his passion for Indiana basketball to a company worth five pot seven billion dollars the day that broadcast.com was sold to Yahoo I thk a lot  folks felt like we had hit the lottery twice the unorthodox entrepreneur has disrupted every busess he touched he said never blow the stuff this is not what I want rip everythg I always start aga he's been slammed elimated  vestigated Mark Cuban order to appear before the SEC but almost always comes out on top he is smart beg one  the smartest people but he goes ooh you could make the argument it was one  the luckiest people  the age  the Internet somebody has got to be the luckiest person  the world nobody's got it it appears that they are facility gamebygame basis but I can't feel  Mark Cuban got  at the begng  the ternet boom  it served him well his gold me was called broadcast comm one  the first ternet sites to stream events live everythg from Victoria's Secret models to countless sportg events we were the first ones to scale ternet broadcastg you know to take five hundred radio stations  broadcast them on the Internet a hundred television stations earngs calls product launches college football games deals with the NHL Major League Baseball mean we had really become a broadcast network on the Internet the fiercely dependent entrepreneur has blazed a trail to TV movies NBA ownership  he even stars on a TV show though he decled to participate  this one mark has been an entrepreneur from the moment the word was vented before it meant drug deal Mark Cuban was born  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania  grew up  a suburb called Mount Lebanon from the getgo Cuban was a money maker sellg trash bags newspapers  even postage stamps I started a stamp company I started with a quarter  bought a stamp  left with $50 thkg hey if I could do this I could do anythg by the time he was 16 he had already built a reputation Brian Cuban is his younger brother I remember mark beg given $5,000 by one  our neighbors to go buy stamps  New York with my father now he was always the entrepreneur a stamp shows but that just shows you at that age what people thought  his ability to make money that skill only grew at Indiana  the tireless busess major taught disco started a cha letter  decided to run a bar if he could come up with $15,000 Evan Williams was an engeer at General Motors who played on the school rugby club with Mark Cuban he was at my house one day he was callg banks to try to get a loan so I could buy this bar so on my way out said hey mark if you have any problems gettg that loan just give me a call two days later he goes hey EV so I ended up late 1979 loang mark fifteen thous dollars so he could buy a bar  Bloomgton Kuban awarded Williams stock certificate number one  with months opened his bar Motley's Wayne Wston teaches graduate statistics at Indiana   my over 35 years  teachg I've never had a student really start a busess while they were an undergrad or an MBA here on campus  he started Motley's which became by far I thk the best bar  town the busess model he used  Motley's is very close to the same busess models he used  his next two or three busesses he always would have 51%  it even though he didn't put up any  his own money but no one really complaed because he was the one that built up the busess until it came crashg down after a wet tshirt contest it's pretty common knowledge around town  underage girl won a wet tshirt contest  so I thk that hurt the future  the bar let's put it that way Kuban graduated  soon led  Dallas with a year the born entrepreneur launched micro solutions providg stware hardware  trag to busesses at the dawn  the PC revolution it was a family affair Marko's you come work for me so I said fe so my first day at work you're not a big lawyer I show up with my suit  tie  he goes why are you wearg that well you know come to work for you at micro solutions no go home  change put on crappy clothes  your jeans you're  the stockroom mark doesn't give you anythg you have to learn it  earn it Mark Cuban learned the computer busess fast   seven years sold his company to CompuServe for six million dollars I retired  you retired  what did you do with that money your biggest purchase my biggest purchase I bought a lifetime pass on American Airles  I had one mission  md I wanted to be already go to as many countries around the world as I could  get drunk with as many people as I possibly could  I was so good  1995 Mark Cuban came out  early retirement to revent radio accordg to Cuban college friend Todd Wagner brought him the concept it's a story that Hoosiers basketball fan has told ten as  this terview on 60 mutes he sat me down he said look I've got this idea where I thk we can listen to Indiana basketball sportg events you know anywhere  the world by usg the Internet so mark  I just basically said let's fd out if this is a busess or not so we set up shop  his upstairs bedroom  his house  you know got us a computer got the stware  started playg with it  that is the birth  audio net what eventually became broadcast comm but another young entrepreneur tells a different story Chris jabe says he was also a founder  the company when I was pretty young I was a Mnesota Tws fan I moved to Texas oh it's a displaced fan I was always tryg to figure out how to get access to those games that I couldn't see on regular TV when the ternet came along it's like it was a slam dunk because now it was just a matter  queryg broadcast rights he took his plan to vestors one  them was Cuban I probably had this pitch dyed given to maybe 150 people over the previous year  a half to two years  so I'm gettg to my pitch this shoots about a 20mute pitch  with three mutes he goes I'm  I'll do it Jeb asked for a million dollars  said that Cuban wrote a check for 10,000  months later tried to cut him out completely mark said Chris I really don't need you you really don't have that much to add I can pretty much do or get people to do what you're dog so I was a little bummed to say the least  I really give Todd a lot  credit when he came to me  said you know we can work a deal with you know for 2,500 a month  10%  the company  the way he described it  the Ray he showed me the paperwork I knew it was real  it really made me feel really good actually even though it was hard to take 10%  a company that I developed 100% from scratch cuban became the drivg force  audio net mark overall really wanted to see it as his company he had made it gone from really idea to reality he never really want to acknowledge me as a founder but counder Todd Wagner does acknowledge Jeb's participation he was there for a very brief period  time  then he went on to the next thg he owned the slug  equity  did just fe audio net did better than just fe you go back  there  all they did was have all these servers with all these different sportg events gog on  people tryg to keep the server's up virtually what is gog on  here they're planng a nuclear strike you know but it was controlled chaos  they're keepg all those servers up  all the game streamg it was pretty cool Kuban  Wagner changed the name from audio net to broadcast comm  1998  positioned the company to go public the ternet boom was  full swg  on July 17th the stock hit the market priced at $18 a share the first trade pops up  it was you know $63 or whatever it was I mean it was just through the ro nada Oh Cena led the sports properties  marketg departments at the company I recall our head  HR poppg her head out  a cube like a game  whackamole  sayg we opened at whatever the number was  everyone looked up  we thought she missed by a decimal she must be wrong  we all started a look  you could just see heads poppg out  the excitement  the room it was literally like a parade went f the stock closed at 60 to 75 at the time it's set a record for the highest percentage crease on an openg day I'm the first to realize that luck plays a huge part  it I happen to have a company broadcast comm that went public at the right time when the ternet stock market was gog nuts Cuban wanted to exp their content  was lookg for a breakout event he founded  lgerie there were a lot  pnacle events for broadcast comm  one  those was certaly the Victoria's Secret webcast rappg hightech with highfashion the webcast was a phenomenon millions  people tuned   it became the largest viewed event ever on the web we like to position it as the first soldout event on the Internet it helped to cement us as the goto place if you wanted to do somethg multimedia on the Internet Jeff Sweeney is an entrepreneur  friend  Cubans from Dallas I will never forget talkg to Marc about you know where are you gog with this broadcast thg  he goes I'm gog to the  billionaire boys club you're not gonna make a billion dollars on this thg I mean you're gonna make one hundred million dollars no no no dude no  dude that's what I'm dog  pursuit  that billion Cuban  Wagner led the charge straight to the executive fices  Yahoo I remember mark  I gog to the conference room  basically just sayg look we're where you guys need to be so you're either gonna have to compete with us or you're gonna have to buy us because we are big players  what we thk the Internet's gonna go Yahoo felt the breadth  competition accordg to Paul Sappho a leadg technology forecaster it's a moment where there's a sense  the rise  the maches algorithms the form  Google are really takg over the search space  it's begng to dawn on people that  fact there is a lot  volatility  customer loyalty around place as you visit on the web I can remember gog to Yahoo  you could just feel the anxiety at the company how do we bulk up our technology side lookg for an answer  April 1999 Yahoo grabbed broadcast.com for a staggerg sum 5.7 billion dollars  stock the deal secured Cubans membership  that billionaires Club I thk a lot  folks felt like we had hit the lottery twice you had this tremendous IPO  to top it f one  the the great companies  Silicon Valley Yahoo comes   acquires this little old company that was set up  Deep Ellum Dallas Texas it couldn't have been frankly scripted any better but not scripted all that well for Yahoo it is so easy to quarterback this thg  as people say it's one  the stupidest moves  the history  the ternet but there was so much stupidity  that period it was like a sgle note  a vast symphony  stupidity yahoo struggled with their new acquisition it's pretty simple to see what happened if you're on the side you had a five billion dollar acquisition hed to a number  NBA's who had never actually tegrated anythg before we ah who really took a poundg they took their eye f the ball  search which opened the door for Google who smoked them with months  the buyout Kuban protected a stock by buyg puts  calls agast his terest  began to cash out buyg a twenty four thous square foot mansion  a forty 1 million dollar jet but his next purchase would be the billionaire's prized possession you  January 2000 sports fanatic Mark Cuban bought majority ownership  the Dallas Mavericks from Ross Perot jr. it was the crowng purchase for the billionaire with the satiable desire to w except that the franchise had one  the worst wloss records  any team  the NBA you've gotta start givg these guys who have been  damage programs let's call him the thought process that they can w that they are expected to w Cuban was gog to change everythg his way terr Dima Ussery the buttonedup CEO  the Dallas Mavericks recalled his first meetg I didn't need the whole day because we're havg dner at his house that night  I want to be a great guest  I was  suit  tie  you know tell my Sunday best is my mom called it he opened doors  jeans  no shoes him tshirt  we sat on this floor  watch basketball for four or five hours  eight I thk anythg was cocoa puffs  Doritos is what we had  bottled waters so it was it was just a new reality that new reality took effect the moment Cubans saw the traditional wood paneled locker room  the Mavericks new arena he said you've got to blow this up this is not what I want I want a law  come on open ceilgs I want the guys to fly kits a clubhouse the place they hang out  we got to get a pool table  here  we got to get the DVDs rip everythg out  start aga  the clubhouse the radical new owner booked firstclass hotels for road games  went by a team jet with legroom for seven footers all that stuff was noon none  that stuff had been done  the league before nor had an owner worn a Mavs fan for life tshirt or put his email address on the jumbotron or broken custom by ditchg the skybox for courtside seats  yellg at the referees mark is the plenty that's gotten him  trouble Scot sosnick reports on sports busess for   my favorite one is when he said that a referee wasn't qualified to manage a Dairy Queen but when he said that Dairy Queen got upset but they wanted mark to know what their managers were highly traed highly skilled folks  so the guy challenged mark to come down  serve ice cream  to see how difficult it really was there were probably six helicopters hoverg above at this poor Dairy Queen there were probably 3,000 people outside  he was there additional ice cream he's a very very smart marketg guy  if he can turn a negative to a positive he will but Cubans courtside criticism was a negative for David Stern the longtime Commissioner  the NBA I thk mark was very impatient when he first became an owner because he strives for perfection  he expressed his views  that regard it wasn't a constructive enterprise to publicly criticize our ficials  it's prohibited by our rules those rules resulted  Cubans first fe  $5,000 followed by fes  15,000 25,000 250,000 100,000 10,000  100,000 aga all  his first full season as an owner my job is to st up for my my guys enough I thk somethg's wrong I'm gonna do somethg about it reporter John Swartz followed Cubans career for 13 years that connects with people you don't see that among many billionaires they thk they have to act a certa way now that he cares I thk you honestly just could give a damn what anyone thks about him Cubans hson volvement brought immediate success attendance shot up more than 35% the estimated teen value left fifty million dollars  the Mavericks went to the playfs  2001 for the first time  over ten years before he owned the Dallas Mavericks they were the laughgstock  the NBA they were wng 15 games a year once he took over their wng percentages got to be one  the best it's done beg the top five despite their surgg success that year the Mavericks fell short  the championship  success for Cuban  the film  TV busess was also provg elusive at the dawn  HDTV  2001 he launched the first highdefition television network called HD net as he explaed to Charlie Rose we're available on cable were available on satellite but viewers can go knowg that not only they're gonna get great entertament but they're gonna get great entertament  the best possible picture quality the network sputtered barely reachg 350,000 homes  its first year Cuban hit pause long enough to marry longtime girlfriend Tiffany Stewart throwg a reception bash on his home court the American Airles Center by 2003 he reteamed with Todd Wagner  plunged to the movie busess we bought Lmark atres which was a national dependent theater cha we vested  then bought Magnolia Pictures a theatrical distribution company we built on a home entertament unit as well to that  all  a sudden we had built a vertically tegrated media company meang with production distribution  exhibition all under one ro  a way that frankly we had not seen done before it gave Cuban the pieces to shake up the movie busess by releasg a film  theaters on DVD  TV simultaneously Andy fix mer is an entertament reporter for   back then nobody was dog this nobody even thought that you would dare put a movie on television before it was released  theaters it just wasn't done Cubans movies met with mixed success some films like good night  good luck had found critical acclaim  a niche audience while others struggled  there was a disappotment aga on the basketball court star Dirk Nowitzki led the team to the fals  2006 the Mavs were up two games to none when momentum suddenly shifted  the team dropped three straight Cuban was livid when he was pissed he may as well have been Satan the players literally ran the other way  the locker room after their collapse  the championship Nowitzki publicly called for Cuban to control his temper for the owner who hated to lose the loss was pure devastation I believe he didn't leave the house for three weeks  he became a shut so what did it cost him it cost him his dream really his dream was to turn the Mavericks to Champions Mark Cuban the former disco teacher returned to dancg  2007  front  millions mark likes as much air time as he can get as long as it's fun  it's entertament for him he's gog to do it he appeared on almost anythg even hostg his own reality show the benefactor canceled after one season viewers were also  short supply on his own network with it's strange blend  biki themed programmg mixed martial arts  dan Rather dan Rather  Dan Rather reports on HDNet is kd  my own personal dulgence you know I'm a news junky  always have been dan Rather was dog his show for them which was actually very good but the rest  it was just like a Sargasso Sea  just crap Cuban had more troubles loomg the Securities  Exchange Commission filed a suit agast him we return now to the crackdown on sider tradg  it has ensnared billionaire the SEC alleged that Cuban dumped 600,000 shares  mama calm as an sider trade the 2008 lawsuit from the SEC says he sold shares the company ahead  the company's own plans to sell more discounted shares to vestors  avoided threequarters  a million dollars worth  losses on his blog Cuban stated the claims were false the suit was dismissed  District Court but the SEC appealed  the case was restated  2010 while Cuban battled  the courtroom he also prepared for battle on the basketball court he dealt for key players hired a new coach   2011 the Mavericks fought their way back to the fighters surprisg everyone the loudmouth behd the team bench went silent it was different I mean still people went up  talked to him but he said not today not me talk to the players with Mark  the background it was this other guy Dirk Nowitzki  the team that Mark had assembled that  the end was able to live f what he's always dreamed  we've had the ceremony side the buildg  all  a sudden chant broke out thank you Mark thank you Mark thank you mark how many times have you heard  a buildg chantg thank you to the owner that's pretty unique with a championship banner fally  place Cuban rebred HDNet callg it access TV  addition to Ryan Seacrest Cuban partnered with two  the most powerful names    entertament he lives  Dallas with his wife  three children on his personal blog he sounds f on everythg from executive compensation to personal health weather brilliant are just pla lucky Mark Cuban will always be lookg for his next big move is gog to challenge conventions he's gonna change how people thk he's defitely a guy to always keep your eye on he's brash he's not afraid  controversy but he's also one  the most brilliant strategic thkers I've ever met is the glass  water halffull or halfempty Mark's gonna be the guy askg whose porn you can look at thgs  say this is the way they've always been done I like to look at  said well if everybody's dog this way that's not where the

14,0.0,"thk about everythg you touch  a day now thk about how much  it is plastic plastics are amazg materials they're lightweight but strong flexible but impermeable they're  our cars planes hospitals weapons  electronics plastic is everywhere but  course that's the problem plastic is everywhere more importantly plastics don't biodegrade that water bottle you use for ten mutes it could take 500 years or more to fully decomposed most plastics that we use are sgleuse short time use packagg  then they're discarded that mismatch between plastics short use  long life results  an overflow  plastic waste thk about how crazy this is to get the raw materials for plastics we spend billions pullg fossil fuels out  the earth then we pollute the earth to make plastics  then we toss those plastics right back to the ground where they came from I thk 50 years from now what will happen is people will be diggg out l fields  takg out product to recycle  they will thk we were crazy people  dumpg thgs  lfills so we should just get rid  plastic small problem there is nothg better at dog what plastic does than plastic when it comes to its low cost versatility  durability the plastic we use today is unbeatable we're not gog to get rid  plastics anytime soon so we better deal with them  a more telligent way from where they come from  also where they go after we're done usg them that means two thgs we have to develop new environmentally friendly materials that can replace petroleumbased plastics  we have to fd a way to clean up the plastics we've already discarded one  the team's that's developg a sustaable replacement for plastic is here  this lab at the Center for sustaable polymers at the   Mnesota the majority  plastics that we use now are from petroleum  by majority I mean more than 90 percent maybe more than 95 but the team at this lab is tryg to change that they are tryg to totally rethk where a plastic can come from could you make a plastic  livg materials like plants or bacteria one  the common misconceptions  the world  plastic is that there's plastic well actually there's several different varieties  plastic you familiar with recyclg symbols there's seven  those so there's no one plastic that will replace all plastics at the lab researchers are workg on several types  bio plastics that's plastic made out  renewable resources that could be used for everythg from the soles  shoes to housg sulation the latest breakthrough is a new type  foam that could replace petroleumbased cushiong like what's  car seats  beddg  it all starts with bacteria it's eco life its STD check life so that's the stra that we use for our experiments the e.coli is genetically modified meang it's given a new set  structions  this case to synthesize molecules that can be polymerized to create new materials then they're fed sugar shaken  fermented the byproduct  this process is a molecule that's a precursor to plastic when mixed with a catalyst  the lab the chemical reaction produces this bubblg gellike substance when it hardens you've got foam so it's still pretty sticky but this can then be cut  thrown to pillows the ma reason that I thk this is important is because the feedstock is renewable there's an endless supply  bacteria  sugar a far cry from petroleum which is limited  supply  expensive to fd so that's where the foam comes from but what happens when it's time to throw it away when you're ready to get rid  that car seat or pillow most phones aren't recycled  if they are they're chopped up  broken to a degraded material but if this foam is collected it can be chemically broken back down to the same precursor they started with which can then be used to create new foams over  over aga the lab is also workg on a replacement for rubber  thgs like shoes tires sportg equipment or household items so we want to look for rubbery materials thgs that are stretchy that are elastic that can be extended  they snap right back this process starts with starch from corn chemists can synthesize the polymer  the lab dry it  then mold it once we form some  the rubbers that we use today we can't reprocess them they can just be ground up  make the playground rubber material but this you can melt  reprocess  reuse it  it's compostable that's what we strive for right because we don't want to have our ocean filled with process so why aren't materials like this  all  our couches  shoes already so I tentimes joke that my lab has produced a lot  materials that have terestg  excitg properties but nobody really cares about him that's because the bio plastics  this lab are still relatively expensive to produce especially now with oil prices so low the unfortunate reality is that consumers like you will not pay a premium for bio renewability or degradability they're not much  a premium an ideal bioplastic would not only look  perform as well as petroleumbased plastics it would be just as cheap  easy to produce it probably won't look any different I'll still grab the bag to put my fruit at the grocery store except it'll be from biobased feedstocks  except when I throw it away it'll have a facile route to decomposition to give environmentally nocuous byproducts if this lab succeeds a better world might look a lot like the one we already live  bio plastics may be a few years out but there are steps we can take today to help clean up the plastic we've already used we're at carbon light dustries  Riverside California it's a plastics recyclg plant one that specializes  recyclg a type  plastic called PE tea that you fd  most soda  water bottles every day 300,000 pounds  plastic bottles arrive  bales that's 3 billion bottles a year they're sent through a maze  hightech maches that sort clean melt  sanitize them it's what you thk  when you thk  a recyclg plant except carbon light does somethg few recyclers are actually able to do turn plastic bottles back to material for new plastic bottles this is Leon Ferran ik founder  CEO  carbon light by the way Leon's been  plastics for a long time he ran one  the first companies that troduced plastic bags to grocery stores  the 80s I feel that ok I brought grocery sacks  all that now I'm what do you call it redeemg myself  I'm dog recyclg until recently most plastic bottles collected for recyclg  the US were sent overseas a lot  the bottles that was collected  California for example or other places were beg shipped to  so what the Chese would do take the bottles transform it to a lesser material like a carpet like fabric  then ship it back to us bottle to bottle like what we do that we call it cradle to cradle that that happens a lot less what most people don't realize is when they throw a plastic water bottle to a blue or green recyclg b that bottles less likely to become another bottle than it is to become somethg else like carpet or teddy bear stuffg  if it wds up livg a second life as carpetg or teddy bear stuffg then it more than likely ends it's recyclable life there that's because those materials are harder to collect  recycle why not just turn old plastic bottles to new ones well it's expensive  you have to have a very sophisticated facility like this one to be able to make the necessary material for people to use it for their beverages Jeff Walsh vice president  operations took us around to show us the ner workgs ok so this is where the process starts one  these bales weighs about 1300 pounds or so first bottles are broken out  bales trash  non PE tea materials are separated usg optical sorters then a rse cycle begs to remove labels  camps colored  clear materials are separated then they get crushed  hot washed fally the bottles are ground to what carbon light calls cornflake the last step is meltg the flake  cuttg

15,0.0,"A Lion Air Boeg 737 crashed to the sea this morng. Rescuers have located debris, but they do not expect\nto fd any survivors. Some  the warng signs,  retrospect were there all along. Some  the decisions, or changes, were so subtle that people\nmight not even have realized the importance, as they were takg place. And Ethiopian Airles flight has crashed shortly after takef from Addis Ababa, killg\nall 157 passengers  crew thought to be on board. Boeg\'s bestsellg plane is comg under creased scruty after another deadly accident. We\'ll do everythg\npossible to earn  reearn that trust  confidence from our customers  the flyg public  the weeks  months ahead. Boeg is an American icon, revered around the world for\nits engeerg novation. But with two crashes  under six months, critics have asked if Boeg is strayg from its origal mission.  SEC is vestigatg whether Boeg properly disclosed issues\ntied to the groundg  its 737 Max Airlers. One message described the 737 Max as a plane designed by\nclowns, overseen by monkeys.  safety culture at Boeg was corrupted under pressure from  ,  executives,  board members who were look\' more at their bonuses than they were at the\ntegrity  the organization. Boeg was playg a\ngame, to a certa extent. It was a game  numbers. y were meetg \n\'s expectations, but unfortunately, that came at the expense  the end\ncustomer,  the flyg public.  failures that happened at Boeg are really complicated,\n volve subtle forces  cultural changes\nthat have been underway for decades at the company. This is a story  how an American icon lost its way,  whether or not it can fd it aga. 2019 was not the best year for Boeg. Just five months apart, two\nBoeg 737 Max planes crashed,  the planes have been\ngrounded sce March  2019. re\'s simply no precedent,  aviation, for a plane this important\nto be grounded this long. In the first crash, Lion air flight 610, somethg was discovered with\nthe technology on the plane. Investigators believe the plane\'s sensors or its computers, had bad data\nsuggestg a potential stall. re was this stware system, known as MCAST, that sts for maneuverg characteristics\naugmentation system. This obscure flight control stware was created so the Max hled\nthe same way for pilots as the previous generation  737s. Black box data dicated that a bad sensor had triggered MCAST, which automatically pushed the plane down. With probably 2 hours\n them discoverg this, Boeg  the FAA put out a warng, dicatg that this could occur,  then also tellg\nthem how to counteract it. re is a fix, simply flippg a switch should have turned the\nautomatic system f.  second crash,\nhowever, the same failure. I\'ve covered dozens \ndozens  plane crashes,  one  my mantras has always been that crashes don\'t occur\nfor the same cause.  grounded the plane,  it just set f a ripple effect. Any plane currently  the air will go to its destation,\n thereafter be grounded. Boeg is an credible company,  hopefully they\'ll very\nquickly come up with the answer. What had been billed as a relatively simple stware\nfix proved not to be so simple. Every time it seemed like Boeg\nwas just around the corner, then a new issue cropped up. MCAST wasn\'t the only\nissue on this airplane, you had issues where the computers were gettg overloaded with formation, now there\'s a new issue that the computers don\'t start up properly, when you want them to. And then, the first batch  really embarrassg\nemployee emails leaked.  FAA is demg answers from Boeg after they waited months\nto disclose to the agency ternal messages between test pilots who were workg  the\n737 Max flight simulator. ""It\'s runng rampant  the sim on me."" One pilot, referencg\nthe flight simulator. "" plane is trimmg itself like crazy.""  emails came out two weeks before Boeg\'s Chief Executive,\nDennis Muilenburg, was due to testify before Congress,  it was a bipartisan shellackg. 36 people are dead because what these chief\npilots describe as egregious. You\'re the CEO, the buck stops with you, did you read this document,  how did your team not\nput it  front  you, run  with their hair on fire, say\' \'We got a real problem here.\' Ultimately, we don\'t quite know exactly what caused the MCAST design, just like we don\'t know all\nthe causes  the crash, we don\'t quite know, but it\'s very clear that the one big cultural change at Boeg had been a disruption  the communication between engeers  top management. But this kd  cultural change for a company as old as\nBoeg happens slowly, over the course  not years, but decades. Boeg\'s history goes back over a century,  while its early sea\nplanes weren\'t iconic, by  War Two, their\nmilitary aircraft were. When news  the successful raid by the Flyg Fortresses comes , these are the people who\nget the biggest thrill, the thouss  Boeg\nworkers who build them. Boeg\'s an American manufacturg icon. It was churng out bombers that were critical to the\nallied defense effort,  gave us Rosie the Riveter. Sort  a symbol for\nAmerican co culture. Employers fd that women can do many jobs as well as\nmen, some jobs better. y were the great survivors\n the post War Two shakedown  aircraft design,  the most successful new entrant  the new jetler\nmarket  the late 1950s.  company gambled\neverythg on a prototype  what became its first\njetler, the Boeg 707. Nearg completion  the Boeg plant at Seattle, America\'s first jet transport is a unit  glisteng beauty. And that was followed by the 727,  built this revolutionary\nbehemoth, the 77, you probably know it for\nthe hump behd the nose,  at the same time, they\ncame up with what became Boeg\'s greatest commercial success,  that was the 737.  737 wasn\'t immediately successful. It took several design\n engeerg iterations to turn it to the\nplane that we see today. It became a work horse for\nairles like Southwest, that fly primarily shorter routes,  really brought travel\nto every day people. And even as more  more travelers flew on these aircraft, the aviation safety\nrecord durg this time made flyg one  the\nstatistically safest ways to travel. We\'ve been the technology\nleader  aviation  the world. Boeg was a magnificent company, who made,  my opion, the\nbest airplanes  the world, until some  these\nrecent cultural changes, which all came from\npressure to  ,  bad management. You know, over the years, Boeg was this tremendously important  novative company, but it wasn\'t necessarily a great stock. In 1997, Boeg merged\nwith McDonnell Douglas, another aerospace  defense giant. Boeg said \'let\'s do a merger, we\'ll\ncontue with the novation, \' maybe McDonnell Douglas will help us \' terms  our structure \' tellg our story to  .\' most immediately you began to hear kd  a bitter joke\ncomg out  Seattle, that McDonnell Douglas had used Boeg\'s money to buy Boeg,  certaly,  terms\n management structure, it began to look that way. Harry Stonecipher, a former GE executive  McDonnell Douglas CEO, becomes COO  the combed companies. And more  more  the\ncompany\'s style  culture began to be more  a McDonnell\nDouglas sort  picture. He almost immediately signaled there was a new sheriff  town,  he was gonna brg\nfancial disciple to Boeg. Stonecipher would eventually become CEO,  contued his emphasis on controllg costs with the company. A culture that engeers\nwith the company would beg to feel. We had breakfast with\nthe president  the This is Stan Sorscher, he was a physicist at\nBoeg for over 20 years,  felt these changes firsth. And he said he was so proud  cuttg his capital expenditure budgets by 60%. Capital expenditures, for us, were improvements  the\nfactory,  our shop floor,  processes  materials\n thgs like that. By 2000, there was a great\ndeal  dissatisfaction with the way our problem solvg culture\nwas beg displaced,  we thought it was\njust much more difficult for us to do our job. And that\'s when a lot  people trace this sort  fundamental shift  thkg  terms  what you prioritize, whether that be prits, or\nwhether that be engeerg. Further evidence  a move away from engeerg prowess  novation, to prit,\nwas Boeg\'s decision to move company headquarters to Chicago, when Boeg\'s jet manufacturg  airplane designers were  Seattle. Probably the biggest motivation was to send a message to the  that this was a company\nthat was not gog to make vestment decisions\non the basis  legacy, or heritage, or anythg like that, but rather, purely make\nvestment decisions on the basis  returns,  by movg to a place\nwhere there were no legacy loyalties, no heritage\nproduction facilities, they were sendg that message. And it also started to shape how Boeg viewed its own ternal vestments  thgs like airplane programs, tremendously important as the company started planng for what\nbecame the 787 Dreamler. Ladies  gentlemen, your 787 Dreamler. For this event, it was held\non July 8, 2007, so 787, Tom Brokaw was there, I was there just sittg  the audience, just tryg to soak it all . I thk they raised the factory door,  there was the plane. But at the time, it was\njust, it was an empty shell. We didn\'t know it, but it\nwas all for appearances. For the 787, Boeg attempted a new system for designg the aircraft. Instead  dog everythg  house, it would outsource much  the plane\'s design  manufacturg\nto its biggest suppliers. It was gonna be about outsourcg, outsourcg to the places where we could produce thgs more cheaply, as opposed to the fest, best, safest airplanes  the world, which is what Boeg made for decades. This works for runng\nshoes, ladies garments, cell phones, hard drives,\ntegrated circuits, it works for everybody, it\'ll\nwork for you,  I thought \'No, it won\'t.\' Boeg had never done a plane\nusg the system before, this was very different from Boeg controllg the processes itself,  it did not go well. We launched the 787, the\nworst I could thk  was that we\'d be three months late, which is a shootg fense at Boeg. It wasn\'t three months late,\nit was three years late, it wasn\'t 5 billion dollars over budget, it was 30 or 0 or 50\nbillion dollars over budget. Grounded the fleet for three months.  suppliers were just\n over their heads, most  them, we had years  issues, there was an enge\nexplosion at one pot, there was an electrical fire\non flight test aircraft. And I thought \'Okay, this experiment is done.\' This didn\'t work. And the executive said \' busess model is fe,\nwe just didn\'t execute it.\' Every new airplane has growg pas, especially those that kd  push the edge  the\nenvelope  technology. Eventually, Boeg would fix many  the 787\'s issues,  the Dreamler slowly\nstarted to brg  big returns,  with a pritable plane, Boeg looked at other measures to boost its returns to shareholders. re\'s different ways \ngettg your prit up, so one is just that you make\nthe best product imagable,  everybody wants to buy it,  so your sales go up,  you make more money on that plane.  other is that you do\nfancial engeerg. One common technique for companies to boost their stock price is a practice known as stock buybacks, where a company uses its capital to buy back its own stock\nfrom the marketplace. And the math is really\nsimple to underst, if you have fewer shares\ntradg, absent all else, the price goes up, the shares worth more, they get a nice return\non their vestment. Boeg\'s stock was on the rise,  by 2015, new CEO Dennis Muilenburg would ramp the program up even more. From 201 to 2019,\nBoeg would repurchase about 38 billion  its own shares. y went from a relatively\nnormal percentage, somethg like 30%, to over 90%  cash beg returned to vestors. And the contrast to pensions beg cut was really shockg,  sort  a bitter\nmoment for some people. Buyg back shares, \npayg huge dividends, while you\'re layg f senior engeers to hire cheap labor \nIndia, that\'s a sickness. But while long time employees at Boeg may have been frustrated, at the time, this was viewed as a huge success. In less than a decade, the\ncompany\'s stock price tripled.   just loved this\ncompany, its stock shot up. I see a new Boeg, I just\nsee just straight le growth. And Muilenburg was gettg\nthe rockstar treatment. You\'re obviously a very\naccomplished executive, you\'ve done a great job for\nBoeg  its shareholders, I wish I had bought the\nstock when you took over. It\'s still a good deal.\nStill a good deal. Around the same time all\n this was happeng, Boeg was sellg record\nnumbers  its newest plane, the 737 Max.  737 Max was born out \na competition with Airbus.  aviation dustry is a duopoly between Boeg  Airbus, with the two giants controllg almost all  the jetler market. For both companies, it\'s\nbeatg commercial heart is an enormously pritable\nfamily  sgleaisle jets, the Boeg 737,  Airbus A320. While Boeg had planned\nto build an allnew jet to replace the 737, it was sidetracked by\nthe Dreamler debacle. Airbus shocked everyone by\nannouncg a simple upgrade to its A320 family  planes,  what became known as the A320 Neo. Sce the new planes had enges that creased fuel efficiency  required no lengthy\ntrag for pilots to fly, it became a huge cost saver for airles,  a big hit for Airbus. So Boeg had to do the same thg, if Boeg didn\'t act, or waited too long, they could lose significant market share. American Airles called Boeg  said \'We\'re gonna buy 00 planes, \' they will all be Airbus \'unless you can match their fuel economy, \' the fact that no\npilot trag is required, \'it\'s identical to their\nother Airbus models.\' And the Boeg CEO said \'No no no no, we\'ll match that, \'we want half that order.\' With the Max, Boeg\nwas also tryg to shake the image  competence\nthat had followed the 787 debacle, so there was a lot  pressure there, to show that the, \'Hey, look, we can design planes, \' we can meet deadles with the Max.\' And to their credit,\nwith the Max, they did. Unfortunately for Boeg, some  the critical engeerg\ndecisions that were made came back to haunt them. In late 2015, Boeg\'s first 737 Max takes\nshape, right on schedule. Flight testg begs  early 2016,   2017, the Max enters\nthe commercial market, months early,  it is,  fact, that fastest sellg\naircraft  company history. You saw huge orders\ncomg for both companies, airles seemed generally pleased with it,  to be honest, they still are. Even after the crisis, some\n the biggest customers say \'You know what, this is a good airplane.\' But ternal emails, made public from vestigators, revealed that Boeg had gone\nto extraordary measures to get the Max to the air, cludg some employees lyg to the FAA.  Chief Technical Pilot on the plane described how he used Jedi\nmd tricks on regulators. In one exchange, a Boeg employee says ""I still haven\'t been forgiven by God ""for the coverg up I did last year.""  most disturbg thg we\'ve found is, there was a 2013 meetg,  they conspired to conceal the system. MCAST was created so that the larger, more\nfuelefficient enges on the Max wouldn\'t make the plane\nhle any differently than the previous generation  737s. At that meetg, they said \'Well wait a mute, wait a mute, \'if we tell anybody about this system, \'then they might require that \'pilots have additional trag, \' our bosses, from the top,  Boeg, \' our contracts with the airles say \'no additional trag required, \'so we have to conceal this, \'no one outside Boeg can know \'that this safetycritical system exists.\' Another week, another shakeup at Boeg.  company\'s former\nCEO, Dennis Muilenburg, forced out after 35\nyears with the company,  four years as CEO. After firg Muilenburg, Boeg would close their books on one  the worst fancial\nperformances  history, estimatg 18.6 billion  total costs for the grounded 737 Max,  it would report its\nfirst annual loss sce 1997. Dave Calhoun, a member  Boeg\'s board, was tapped as the next CEO,  immediately starts to make sweepg changes with the company.  first couple  weeks on the job, he moved very quickly to get\nany embarrassg overhang from the last year, just\nclean out the cobwebs, get all the bad news out there right now. Tryg to be more transparent, Calhoun dumped even\nmore damng documents,  holds a conference\ncall with reporters. When boards reach a\nconclusion to change a CEO, they expect change. And they recognize the arguments that have been presented from\nthe outside world as legit,  they\'re gonna experience a different style  leadership, a different way  do\' thgs. But it\'s unclear whether or not Calhoun will shift Boeg\'s priority\naway from pleasg  ,  return the company\nto its engeerg roots  heritage  creatg\ntop flight planes. We believe this airplane\'s safer than the safest airplane flyg today. Every next airplane has to be that way, it has to be that way for Boeg, it has to be that way for our competitors. He\'s been on the board sce mid2009,  also one  the, well, almost all  the board members that do not have an engeerg degrees, from a purely accountg background, private equity, hedge\nfunds, that kd  thg. This is a bit strange,\nbecause on one level a company really needs to change. On the other h, other\nthan a shareholder emergency, I\'m not really sure what would be the\nstigator  that change. We are gonna have the most open book the world\'s ever seen, on this subject. Transparency is what we lost for a moment,  it\'s somethg we have to rega, because it speaks to the trust\nthat the world has  us. I am very hopeful that he can restore the safety culture there, so that they can focus\non makg safe airplanes.  old days  simply harvestg cash from legacy programs,  returng it to\nshareholders, needs to stop,  the idea  engeers\nbeg some sort  a commodity that you can rely upon\nto come through for you, that needs to stop, too.  bigger issue  settg the tone, changg culture, which,\nthese thgs happen gradually, bit by bit, he\'s sayg all\nthe right thgs right now, about correctg course, but we won\'t know for awhile as to whether Boeg\'s on the right course."

worth at the time to a dream to take on the militarydustrial complex now here's an immigrant from South Africa comg to America to say you know  that whole rocket thg you do with the space shuttle I got a better way actually travelled to Russia three times look at buyg a refurbished ICBM without the nuke  I Kim's conclusion that the real thg that was really holdg us back from makg much more progress  space it was really that Rockets had not evolved sce the 60s so the trick isn't figurg out how to get to orbit it's figurg out how to get to orbit cheaply so I had to come up with lowcost ways to produce enges the primary structure the electronics to the launch operation as well as run the company with very little overhead  to some  ventions  all those areas is what has led us to a roughly three to fourfold improvement over the cost   other rockets  the United States what SpaceX has been very successful at is takg basically ftheshelf technology stuff that was developed by  50 years ago  streamlg it so  that way he's kd  the Henry Ford   space because Henry Ford didn't vent the automobile he just figured out how to make the automobile you know commercially viable musk was more than just an entrepreneur if you ask yuan how he managed to teach himself rocket science he'll just look at you very seriously  just say very quietly read a lot  books thirty twoyearold Elon Musk had his next big idea at his family's annual visit to Burng Man the counterculture desert happeng although still fascated by rockets  fast cars he wanted to fd a way to end Earth's addiction to fossil fuels I was one that the idea  gog to the solar power arena to Lyndon  Peter I  my couss he's basically hs this idea to his couss  says if you want to start this I will I will fund you  it'll be your company but I'll be the Chairman  they say okay  it works almost perfectly what they've figured out is that if you sort  do a hundred thgs ten percent better  the area  solar cell stallation for homeowners you can dramatically consolidate an dustry that's currently a bunch  mompop shops so it Solar City stead was they say how about no money done you want solar cells we'll just put it  you don't pay a cent right it's like leasg a car but even better Solar City started  five western states  soon grew to the largest solar service provider  the US the solar cells keep gog solar city that only goes up at the end at least so the fascatg busess model were  the long run they may become the largest energy generator  America all  these but renewable energy was just one part  a much bigger goal musk had a more ambitious plan for a sustaable future he had this idea that he wanted to make electric cars help humanity get f fossil fuels  so cities about sustaable energy creation whereas Tesla's but sustaable energy consumption  April 200 musk helped launch Tesla with six pot three million dollars  his own money it was the first auto dustry startup  decades  the only one born  Silicon Valley  it's really pretty simple it's you know make a highpriced car at low volume because that's essentially the only thg we could afford to do  then step 2 is a medium priced car at medium volume sce f3 is a low priced car at high volumes Tesla's plan to troduce a highend highperformance product to first attract outliers then make an affordable car for the masses teslascope founder  first CEO Mart Eberhard we expect to to change the way people thk about electric cars with this car  that we hope to open the market for us to sell other electric cars but we also know that if you start f by sayg let's first change human nature  make everybody Drive crummy little cars that doesn't work so stead let's build a car that people want to drive let's build a car this is hot  desirable  beautiful  convce people that drivg you know electric car is not a compromise its idea  actually gog   puttg it  a highend car  breakg the mold  what an electric car wars was excitg this is no longer gonna be a golf cart this is gonna be a Ferrari any cops watchg when we first saw Tesla it had a good explanation for how they get to market without havg to spend exorbitant amount  money how they would create a br  the object  desire  consumers  it's part  the story clicked together he talked about Silicon Valley smarts beg able to show Detroit how to do somethg that Detroit didn't thk was possible its batteries its Drive electronics it's electric motors those are skills that are present  Silicon Valley  our president Detroit Tesla's revolutionary technology for the Roadster started with a computer battery as the power source for the automobile JB Straubel Tesla's chief technology ficer was the ma designer  the electric powertra for the first time it was possible to drive over 200 miles  have performance that was directly comparable competitive with what a gasole car could do  Tesla was the first company to to take those prciples  put that to practice  try it California Governor Schwarzenegger showed up for the roadsters 2006 comgout party a test  this one it's hot he bought one so did Leonardo DiCaprio  rge Clooney but could must sell regular customers on his idea at that time there was very little activity  the auto dustry  electric vehicles we were  the age  the large SUV so it was a little unusual to hear about this company  California that was planng to come to market with a highend allelectric sports car we were very passionate about tryg to make sure that this car was gog to just throw down the gauntlet on what the technology could do  really prove to the world that electric vehicles you know could be credibly fast  could have credibly long range there was kd  a sense  adventure you know dog these thgs for the first time  dog it  a really scrappy way you know we did some  the very first battery packs  my garage  Menlo Park before we actually were able to rent a real fice the big issue for Tesla as with all electric cars has been the batteries their cost  how long they last Eric Noble is president  car lab an automotive consultg firm that evaluates new cars  trucks American consumers are very ready for battery electric vehicles unfortunately battery electric vehicles aren't ready for American consumers the first results at Tesla seemed to support this gloomy forecast when we first started out the thought was simple  really obviously  retrospect quite naive which was to make use  some technology that we developed ourselves but also some technology that would license from AC propulsion put that together  create an electric sports car that would be compellg so let's see where did that fall apart it fell apart when the teen told musk that the projected cost had skyrocketed from $65,000 to 10,000 as the problems mounted musk faced a doordie decision at Tesla he would have to choose between vestg his paypal pay f or let his new company collapse  Elon was lookg at this  sayg the dream is still there but oh my gosh what do I got I got to get this under control by 2007 Tesla was runng out  money fast no one wanted to step up to save the unproven automobile startup Elon Musk had to take the leap alone with make some pretty dramatic changes essentially recapitalized the busess  vest about twice what we origally expected what we really expected as the outer limit basically Tesla got to this pot where they only had enough money  the bank for a couple  months  there's nobody around who are willg to put more money  I take all  my reserve capital  vested  Tesla which was very scary because you know it would actually be quite sad to have the fruits  my labor with subduer  PayPal not amount to anythg but there was no question that I would do that  my md because tells it was too important to till I die I'm available 2/7 just to help solve issues right I call me 3:00 a.m.   Sunday morng I don't care we had to go   make some really hard decisions on on personnel changes  even really had to dedicate his time to the company I want I want I want names named so if someone's always on the hot seat  it's always the root cause for problems they will not be positive organization long term it's not okay to be unhappy  part  this company  if somebody can't get happy right musk  his board replaced Mart Eberhard one  the counders who had been runng Tesla  I thk we kd  really really exceeded the level that Everhart could hle  they're freakg apparent  2007 we either were gonna have to shut the company down or you know wasn't have to take over as CEO it was actually a process  buildg a company as well as buildg a car you know a lot  people that fit  very well with a company when it was extremely small you didn't end up you know fittg  as well when it was larger Everhard didn't go quietly he sued musk for libel sler  breach  contract I believe that I was scapegoated to take the blame for the programs that were not run well must resolve the disputes through mediation but his company was  serious fancial trouble  September 2007 musk flew to Germany with a scheme to raise extra cash by forgg an alliance with Daimler Mercedes it down is the company that vented the ternal combustion enge car the maker  Mercedes smart  their endorsement carries great deal  weight so that was a just a very important moment he had to convce the company that Tesla could supply battery packs for its cars they were skeptical really the key thg was to demonstrate a hardware that worked you know if they can't touch it they can't drive it it's not particularly real he pushed his team to retrit a Daimler smart car with Tesla's electric motor but first they had to fd one the Challenger convertg a smart card to electric was doubly difficult because we couldn't fd a smart card the small cone for sale  the United States we had to send somebody down to Mexico to buy a smart car brgbrg 1/2 to the US  then the smoke is really ty so we had to fit up a motor how electronics  charger  everythg  the squad car the challenge was dauntg to replace the smart cars gas enge with a Tesla drivetra  battery fitted  the ty space under the hood  do it all  less than  weeks we didn't have much time at all we knew that from the begng  we kd  prepared for almost battle  you know setup war room  the shop they worked around the clock stealg maps on the factory floor right up to the deadle the Daimler executives arrived  nut it all convced that it made any sense to work with an American car company let alone a little ty American car company  Silicon Valley while waitg for Daimler's decision must brought  one  the world's leadg automobile designers to help create his next project a modern  sexy family sedan what she called the Model S origally with Model S I thought well let's let's have Kerry Kiska who was had a design studio do the stylg we paid him up pretty good sum  money to do that curiously enough the designs that he worked on that he came up with for us were terrible  what he didn't tell us was that he was actually workg on a competg car company Tesla ficials claimed that perhaps Henrik had come  to learn what Tesla was dog well all along he was planng to form his own company do his own vehicle we were pretty upset with him for basically takg what we're at the time the origal specifications for the Model S  then gog  shoppg a busess plan to create that same car Tesla sued him he sued Tesla  there was all kds  you know fightg Henrik Fisker wouldn't grant  an terview but he told us that I believe there is enough space  the market for several new car companies that pursue a new type  electrified powertra with different philosophies  November 2008 the court ruled  Fiskars favor it was a setback for musk who was also gog through a tough time personally after eight years  marriage  five children Elon  Juste musk divorced I got divorced personal life  somewhat  a shambles   addition gettg you know attacked by some  the media my exwife every bad thg you could image there was more bad news when his bold space transport company SpaceX aga failed to get a rocket  support the First Lord didn't get very far got about a mute up  then it was that there was an enge fire  that was it the second flight actually did make it to space but not too overt  then also flight 3 we didn't get all the way to orbit he started sayg I've got enough money for three cracks at it he put a hundred million dollars  his own money  he sort  hted that the idea that after three he didn't make it it would be over SpaceX would would die must burn through the 100 million he had sunk to SpaceX now he was on his way back to the drawg board three days after the failure he announced like first that he knew what was wrong he announced that they raised money to fance a fourth  the fourth launch was gonna happen  a matter  months which  the rocket dustry was a crazy announcement we were able to sell the palms  then just as we'd solve those problems where you ran smack to the the worst economic recession sce the Great Depression it's been one  the darkest days on    recent memory stock markets fallg the most sce 9/11 the Dow f more than 500 pots this is what fancial Armageddon looks like red screams that scream sell sell sell it was a week that shook    deed the world  a realization that the economy may still head to a deeper downturn as 2008 drew to a close Elon Musk faced the worst crisis  his career all three  his companies appear to be  freefall the worst pot was probably just the weekend before Christmas  2008 we had the economic tsunami take place  made thgs even worse if it wasn't needed we had to shut it down   just figure out what's how do we get through this the stock period  not go bankrupt General Motors shares fallg to more than a 20year low after Goldman cut the automakers ratg to sell on a worseng sales outlook that was tough it was obviously an economic period that swore the bankruptcy  General Motors  Chrysler  there we were a young company sellg a very very optional car I mean it was really you'd people don't need $100,000 sports car  they certaly wouldn't want one gettg poor reviews the popular  programme Top Gear took the Tesla Roadster on a test drive  December 2008 this car then really was shapg up to be somethg wonderful [] although Tesla say it'll do 200 miles we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles  if it does run out it's not a quick job to charge it up aga the combative CEO charged the cident was faked  said he had pro that the Roadster had not run out  power he sued the  to block reruns  the show the case was later dismissed but thgs would get even tougher his energy company Solar City founder the bank that had backed their leases pulled out  the deal I certaly did not anticipate that we would have the worst economic climate sce the Great Depression   one which was disproportionately bad for cars I mean General Motors went bankrupt I mean general general effg motors you know musk was  the fight  his life we had maybe about a week's worth  cash  the bank all or less  there was just very little time left  the year to resolve these these thgs I mean they were like two or three busess days left  the year I never thought I was hot it was possible for me to have a nervous breakdown but if it was possible for me to have a nice break down there that was about as good as that's gog to come when Eden was gog through his sad period I was so sad I felt like I had a hole  my heart  there's nothg you can do you just hurt so much  I just didn't see him gettg out  it he was just so sad  then the next thg I get this call sayg wow you have made a wonderful woman the one bright spot was meetg Talulah Riley a British actress who had never heard  Tesla SpaceX or Elon Musk they married  2010 I could be some sort  hapless engeer that had wered to a London club  he just looked so forlorn he was just sat  the corner on his Blackberry cific he was really out  place  sad I was you know tryg to be very sweet to him  stead  humorg him gog oh yes when he was gay this is my rocket  this is my Musk's personal life was lookg up  the future  SpaceX was fally takg f the fourth attempt to launch the Falcon 1 was a huge success  three months later  rewarded SpaceX with a 1.6 billion dollar contract to resupply the International Space Station but musk had no time to celebrate Tesla was on the verge  fancial disaster I had to make a choice then that either took all  the capital that I had left from the sale  PayPal to eBay  vest that  Tesla or Tesla would die the company is really teeterg on the brk  failure  there's this board meetg late  2008 where they're discussg what's gonna happen  Elon just says well I'm gonna raise a 0 million dollar round to keep the company gog  the board members are kd  wonderg well how is he gonna do that  he says I'm gonna put it all  myself  that credible braggadocio confidence catalyzed a change  people's opion  we  everyone else around the table is like oh my gosh we want to be part  this want to get as much  this vestment as we can he saved the company  its darkest hour with an act  heroism that is hard to describe there's nothg quite like spendg your last remag dollar on a project you believe  it was thankfully they could a good week but it defitely took its toll from the mental stra stpot hicapped man play just burned out a few circuits just after his emergency cash fusion came the news they desperately needed a 0 million dollar deal with Daimler for smart car batteries Daimler later added 50 million for 10%  the company determed not to repeat past mistakes musk focused on brgg his family car to life so I said look we really we need to have our own design studio  that's when I hired fronts from the host housg to design the Model S his green agenda was irresistible to van Holt thous a legendary figure  car design who had already revolutionized the looks  the wgm  Mazda he's completely passionate to really rid the world  this addiction to fossil fuel  that that was somethg that he talked about from the very first sentence first conversation that we had with a new team  place must completely revamp the look  the Model S a sedan doesn't have to be a brick doesn't have to be a big blocky car we wanted to brg this kd  passion  feelg back to this marketplace the architecture  monoliths is really similar to escape word the floor  the vehicle is the battery pack  the motors between the rear wheels  everythg above that is the opportunity's base  March 2009 musk unveiled the prototype for the Model S it could hold seven passengers  as much luggage as a station wagon but to build it he knew he needed a piece  the US government's new 7.5 billion dollar loan program to support alternative energy vehicles  order for Model S to  be successful you know it was important that the the loan come through the government fundg was controversial the New York Times writer Ry Stross called the program the bailout  very very high net worth dividuals who vested  Tesla Motors act musk struck back Ry's cross is a huge douche bag  an idiot okay it wasn't a bailout but alone the Obama admistration agreed to lend Tesla four hundred  sixty five million dollars to massproduced the Model S a move that astounded many  the dustry it's very unlikely that the Tesla vestment has ever repaid to the taxpayers electric vehicles are really not possible  ways that would be effective for most consumers still this is just the religion  electric vehicles  like Jonestown that religion will come to an end there are most certa people who want to see Tesla fail because it is an attack on the mastream car dustry  course the biggest impact that test will have is not the cause that we make ourselves but the fact that we show that you can make compellg electric cars that people really want to buy the government loan came with a challengg condition to get the money he had to first fd a place to build his electric car Tesla burned through 300 million dollars sce 2003 Elon Musk needed to get his model s to production fast ever the risktaker he took another giant gamble purchasg a plant  Fremont California aboned by Toyota  Dream Factory location where Tesla was always the new me factory which was a 50percent Toyota factory sent General Motors factory it's one  the biggest car plants  the world it's a great location close to Tesla headquarters the reality is for very little money Toyota got an albatraoz f its books from an dustry perspective it looked credibly savvy on Toyotas part  credibly naive on Tesla's part car factories are big pieces  sunk capital to retool a factory it takes a tremendous cremental vestment the acquisition released the government funds to beg production despite the fact that Tesla had posted a prit just once sce its foundg musk took his company public  June 2010 the smartest money  the world is is bettg on Tesla not everyone was as upbeat about the company's future Tesla stock voted by   as the least likely to succeed you don't want on this stock you don't want you shouldn't even write the darn thg there hasn't been an IPO  a car company  America sce Henry Ford  that caught people's attention vestors ignored the skeptics Tesla raised 226 million dollars  its IPO must now had the capital to get rollg on the Model S you just saw on his face this sort  just relation  this feelg like all  this sufferg is worth it  it's anger  it's real now  2010 after wng the 1.6 billion dollar contract from  SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch  return a spacecraft from orbit so SpaceX was the first purely commercial groundup development to reach orbit the first successful launch at SpaceX was I'm just wishg through any entities that are listeng please bless this launch  two years later  May 2012 it made history as the first privately held company to send a cargo payload to the International Space Station back on earth the longawaited launch  Tesla's new sedan was also takg f its time delivery model s the Model S started rollg f the production le although questions about range  service remaed not everyone was cheerg  a 2012 presidential debate an cidate Mitt Romney blasted President Obama for the government loan to Tesla lumpg Tesla  with other fancially troubled green companies you put 90 billion dollars like 50 years worth  breaks to to solar  wd to suck it Solyndra  Fisker  Tesla  enter one I mean I add a friend who said you don't just pick the wners  losers he picked the losers but Tesla was no loser  the eyes  the automotive dustry the Model S was the first electric sedan to w motor trends Car  the Year musk didn't have much time to celebrate a few months later the New York Times delivered a devastatg review  the Model S it reported the battery died on its test drive from Washgton to Boston  published an image no CEO would want there was a sad shot  about car owner on a flatbed as though that was the only outcome possible for for such a drive  that's just that's just not true musk went on the fensive unless people said oh you know should it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong you don't battle the New York Times  it's like the hell with that the battle between the reporter  the renegade CEO ended when the New York Times public editor concluded the reportg was imprecise but not done  bad faith but the story didn't affect his bottom le remember that loser comment from a presidential cidate about the 65 million dollar government loan it really feels good to have have repaid the US taxpayer that's that's really what's important here   we're not we didn't just repay the prcipal we actually repaid it with terest   a bonus pay  so ultimately the the US taxpayer actually made a prit  over 20 million dollars on this Tesla repaid the loan ne years ahead  schedule never short on optimism or confidence musk made a stunng promise for the nearly $70,000 car we're guaranteeg that the value  the Model S will be no less than that  a Mercedes sclass after three years I am personally guaranteeg that value  stg behd that guarantee with all  my assets not just with with Tesla he has guaranteed free chargg for the life  the car  has exped the chargg system across the country you'll be able to travel all the way from LA to New York just usg the Tesla supercharger network  supercharger system is free so it's not just free now it's get free forever that's the Tesla commitment his commitment to customers has paid f sce its IPO Tesla shares were up more than fivefold SpaceX  Solar City were also turng prits  this is a biggest  most important customer but almost three quarters  our customers are commercial SpaceX says it has more than four billion dollars  revenue under contract but  all his companies perhaps the greatest success was the one addressg the world's energy need Solar City is now the largest solar service provider  the US  has more than quadrupled  value sce its itial public ferg  December 2012 Solar City has been very very impressive I mean there are you know thouss  people with panels on their ros   lots  big fices I believe eBay has solar city panels so it's it's havg a very big very visible impact on the world he really wants to change the world   my vision  the future that you'll have clean  renewable sources  energy feedg the grid  our all  our vehicles will run f that this is really the future it's somethg wonderful stories about Iran has a selfconfidence that is just it's breathtakg  it's especially breathtakg when you thk about the thgs he's confident about the idea that Humanity is gonna get to Mars that not just humanity is gonna get to Mars that but that he  his lifetime Elon Musk will get to Mars Crusader or canny busessman named one  Time Magaze's most fluential people  the world the risktakg multitaskg CEOs estimated net worth was six billion dollars  June 2013 divorced for the second time musk splits his time between his

18,0.0,"earlier this month Airles for America trade group representg the major US airles as a federal government for 50 billion dollars  assistance to protect  preserve the 750,000 jobs  hardworkg men  women who are directly employed by US airles this set up a heated showdown there's the dustry which says it's  desperate need  fancial help  then there are elected ficials  activists who say the airles would not be  this position if they did not spend so much  their money on stock buybacks which a lot  people see as the companies lg the pockets  shareholders over all else buybacks are ten used as a way to boost a company's stock price the repurchase a shrk shares outstg which creases the value  the remag units they're frequently viewed as a signal from management that the stock is attractively priced so we're gog to take a look at the airle's as own data to help expla why people are so mad about this bailout let's start with American Airles it's the biggest airle  the US  reported havg the most a hundred thirty four thous employees  2019 let's take a moment here to watch the amount American paid  salary wages  benefits grow over the last 10 years now it dips alone  2013 but let's not focus on that stead take a look at the end pot here  2019 American reported payg all  its employees a gr total  twelve pot six billion dollars now let's add another le this is the amount Americans spent on a share buyback program which just means money used to buy back its own stock it's a move that fancially engeer share price gas which enriches shareholders this didn't start happeng until 201 when the company spent just over 1 billion dollars on its stock its buyback program shot up for the next couple  years before comg back down  stayg around the 1 billion dollar mark so we've got a billion here almost  billion here .5 billion here  this  this carry the 1  if you add it all up American has spent twelve pot ne billion dollars over the last six years on its own stock people are mad because twelve pot six billion is what it cost to pay the employees salaries for an entire year  he would add up everythg on this buyback le it surpasses that amount  while stock buybacks are fairly common there are some companies that do have large emergency funds Apple a company that was on the brk  solvency  the 90s is famous for havg a ton  cash on h as  January the company had more than 200 billion dollars  the bank call it a ray day fund call it a possible Netflix acquisition the company has built up one giant emergency fund this might not be the case for the airle's though that was American let's look at Delta it's the secondbiggest airle  has about 91 thous fulltime employees whose wages benefits  everythg else added up to just under 11  a quarter billion dollars  2019 now let's look at Delta's buyback program didn't exist  the begng  the decade but  2013 its 250 million dollars  the annual report a year later it's more than a billion to 2.6 all the way through to the end  2019 over the past seven years Delta spent just under 11  a half billion dollars buyg back its own stock that's almost the exact same amount  spent payg all  its employees salaries  benefits  2019 let's do one fal airle united on March 20th the airle sent out a letter sayg it had already taken drastic measures due to the downturn  travel  would have to reduce payroll to match a 60% cuttg capacity if Congress didn't act soon the airle reported 96 thous employees at the end  2019 if we take a look at the last ten years  its payroll we can see that  2019 United paid out about 12 billion dollars  salaries benefits  other related items let's brg on unitg spy back program this one began  201 at 252 million dollars the followg year it's more than a billion it crosses 2 billion  2016 comes back down a bit   2019 it's about 1.6 billion dollars the total amount spent on buybacks for that fiveyear period is 8.8 billion dollars that's about 75%  the entire amount spent on wages  benefits for all  2019 now  the 750,000 employees Airles for America says it represents these three Airles for about three hundred twenty thous  them  collectively they would need about thirty six billion dollars to pay them for an entire year  collectively over the last seven years they've spent about thirty three pot three billion buyg back their own stock the stimulus bill has about 60 billion dollars set aside for the airles to be able to pay their debts pay their employees  basically keep the lights on but the buyback numbers are what really domated the talks  any help for the airles so people are sayg any airle that is helped by federal funds aka taxpayer money should have various conditions attached like not beg able to buy back stock for a certa period  time  the no buybacks became a major pot  contention  any talk  federal help many airles have spent the last decade dog thgs to crease prits at the cost  passenger comfort like decreasg legroom to add more seats  creasg checked bag fees those creased prits were  part used to buy back stock  now the airles are askg those same passengers with less legroom  $50 check bag fees to keep them afloat the no buybacks dem worked the loans  grants the stimulus bill has for the airles does have caveats that it can't be used for buyback programs  the bill requires any company receivg assistance to freeze anyone's pay who is receivg more than four hundred twenty five thous dollars a year meang no large creases for executives like CEOs we reached out to the airles for comment American Airles told us it had vested twenty billion dollars  wages  benefits while returng thirteen  a half billion dollars to owners  stakeholders the airle also said these are extraordary circumstances travel restrictions  the downturn  dem for commercial  transportation has been Swift  dramatic Delta told us it vested billions  dollars back  our busess improve the customer experience  the air  on the ground achieved an vestment grade balance sheet by payg down debt  fundg our pension with the remader returned to our shareholders through buybacks  dividends United said  a statement it had the highest growth  prit sharg for our workers last year all which far exceeds our share repurchases  that it had suspended its share repurchase program last month now the airles might not have just put this money  the bank if they didn't do buybacks the money could have been used for R&D machery revestment buyg another company pretty much anythg  the downturn caused by the coronavirus is not the airles his fault but the speed at which they were affected might make any CEO start to put away a bigger emergency fund just  case"

scammers  how they tell us they're ready to move   some ways this began two years ago with an vestigation  our own on the other side  the world it's a scam Canadians know all too well not the real Canada Revenue Agency but one  the largest cyber schemes  Canadian history there will be legal as we work to locate the scam centers  Mumbai India we met up with a whistleblower who previously worked

shows how dangerous these scammers can be why do you thk they were followg him we still have questions how do the scammers know who to call how do they get money from victims could it be there's an

about police  Canada nobody contacted us from Canada no one's caught no one no one contacted American authorities did contact us no one contacted although on the website  RCMP  we did see a post relatg to other cases once but you're tellg me 60,000 people at least have complaed  Canada  nobody from Canada is dog anythg nobody poted  the only way you found out about it is by gog on the RCMP website yourself that's right yeah that doesn't seem right they don't simply when our story airs across Canada there is outrage can the Public Safety Mister expla why Canadians have to depend on the  to unearth this scam  protect Canadians will the Prime Mister tell us how we will follow up to ensure that these calls stop  to make sure that Canadians are protected agast organised crimals  India services  telligence agents to do what needs to be done to protect Canadians at home  overseas the RCMP later say they have been talkg to India but all this attention puts the issue on the front burner empowerg more people to come forward this is really scary this is really scary my stomach was just at SEC you feel thick a month after our story taught brass order a special task force be set up at this secure facility outside Toronto we get side the headquarters but what the RCMP call project Octavia it's essentially a national priority vestigation  spector Jim Ogden has a surprise certaly what I know  what I can share is that there are our known targets leads when we get enough evidence then we will charge  prosecute these dividuals  just so I'm clear are we talkg about people who are  this country  Canada that's correct who are helpg carry out this scam that's correct they're defraudg the Canadian public  sendg it sendg it away they're their money laundry while the Mounties focus on trackg the Canadians connected to this crime our trail took us back to India a year after our first vestigation to the CRA scam  we closed  on the call centers carryg out another one this time we had somethg up our sleeve hirg someone to sneak  a hidden camera were the first to get side the tech support scam with crimals usg scare tactics to dem payment for a computer fix you likely don't need what made you thk this was legitimate he sounded genuely concerned  led me to believe that he could fix the problem when Diane begs Facebook account stops workg she calls up a number she thks is for Facebook support but ends up with a convcg scammer stead when you look back on it now how do you feel about it I was vulnerable at the time  I was impulsive yeah  I feel very violated that they had access to everythg on our computer our laws should protect us agast thgs like this after months  our own vestigation we're ready to confront those targetg Canadians which is amazg to thk it's right here back  India we've seen the scammers can be dangerous so we're movg quickly [] the company whose name is at this address says this is a legitimate operation but we know some  the people side are runng a scam why do you have a call center here why do you do this illegally we want to talk to top bosses there are real victims real victims these are real people who cannot afford to lose this money you're takg it from them it seems no one here wants to talk to us at least while we're here they're f the phones anyone want to say anythg nobody okay back  Canada we share our fdgs with the RCMP s highestrankg Fancial Crimes ficial supertendent Peter Payne what does it say that we were able to get side a call center like this yeah no I applaud your efforts for gettg  there but once aga police alone cannot solve this issue there's lots  call centers over what do you say to the scammers were over there if you thk they're unstoppable uh we're not givg up this battle turns out that's a bit  foreshadowg the Mounties know there are accomplices  Canada they know who they are we're about to fd out too this is your market place on the roads outside Toronto a man has no idea police are on his tail the RCMP closg  on Canadians they say are accomplices  an enormous cyber scheme  we're about to witness it all go down we're just outside the RCMP secure facility after months  vestigation to some  the largest cyber schemes  Canadian history they're ready to take action  these are schemes like the CRA scam the tech support scam the bank vestigators scanned the syn card scam all  it comg to a head early this morng we started our vestigation  October  2018 spector Jim Ogden oversees project Octavia the specialists unit vestigatg oversees call center scams my message is that we'll fd you  we'll we'll further vestigate  we'll we'll charge where we can we've traced many  these scams back to India like the tech support scam how much money was stolen from you three thous three thous dollars when now hid fill opposes phone stops workg she Google's a solution  calls the number that appears on her screen he went onto the phone  he said there are many problems on the phone there are hackers from Russia from India from Brazil he said all that about your phone yeah he said it's a complicated issue we need to work on this phone has to be mimum three thous dollars to be able to do the transaction now he pays on her money gone I said where's my money is where does one money are you with this converse are you thieves he's then hung up the phone then I tied the game like ten times twelve times nobody want to answer even as police close  on multiple scams the scammers are adaptg addg a new scheme volvg Canadian Social Insurance numbers we just fended your social surance number  legal enforcement action will be taken agast you as we found some suspicious activities  law enforcement is gettg help from a big name  the tech world that's brgg us back to Microst headquarters near Seattle  the side its Digital Crimes Unit we were here a year ago checkg out how artificial telligence is helpg trace the scammers this is a very pritable crime with a very low risk  prosecution we need to vert that equation lawyer one hard way overseas the global unit here feedg tips  evidence to India over the last ten months Indian law enforcement has dismantled ferry call centers has brought to justice seventy two directors  call centers there but Microst tells us while there have been arrests  India there hasn't been one conviction  a scam boss sce 201 you got this letter right show me that that's really terestg but Hardaway says they're not givg up contug their war with the scammers he says Microst gets a complat  someone impersonatg their agents every seven mutes but guys are now sellg calls for call centers to exploit it's almost like a scam franchise exactly  it has evolved to that because there's so much money to be made  as I said the prits are so big relative to the vestment our own vestigation has led us to believe that there are people  Canada helpg with this scam helpg move money  do other thgs is that somethg that you underst as well yeah that's correct one trail leads to this house  suburban Vancouver  the first to discover court documents which accused the man who lives here  retrievg the money for a fraud connected to these scams he even allegedly moves approximately a million dollars through his accounts prosecutors say that is launderg the proceeds  unlawful activity  are tryg to seize the house his father owns it  denies any wrongdog while his son has now reportedly fled to  we need to target the wallets  the bad guys so that if the money stops flowg they're not gog to be able to keep their operation runng  they will go out  busess Microst is targetg those money mules  talkg the Canadian police about how to do it we're workg with law enforcement  with also other banks fancial services dustries to identify those bad bank accounts or merchant accounts so that they can be suspended  money be returned to victims  they're not the only ones Canadian police are hot on the case too the Mounties are about to take down what they call a super money mule a toplevel scam associate who lives right here  Canada who they are  how the Mounties found them comg up this is your marketplace it's a federal raid our CMP ficers

22,0.0,"this is market play is this label lyg to you I didn't know that that's the question we've got the answers shut the front door juicy secrets from behd the counter you would take the brown meat  turn it red yeah the food may look good but the facts will gross you out the fecal dicator fecal dicator but they're like they're beg told from the top down to fudge the best before date  take a ride  the marketplace Time Mache the fondue mix she bought was over three years old this is your marketplace are you ready to play the boud play along we're about to share five secrets you need to know about best before dates those little labels you see on food packages first question what's the best before date the date you're supposed to know outfit I thk it usually refers to a state or even legally found on the Shelf best before date would be probably somethg about you shouldn't eat afterwards on the streets  Toronto ash is hearg a lot  guessg so I'm gog to get the food facts on those dates from microbiologist Keith Warner I actually found this pack  crackers  the back  my cupboard  it has a best before date  April  201 so well over a year ago would these still be safe to eat so let's have a look at them you'll probably break a two for two on those but they're perfectly safe so I get to do the taste test all right here we go oh this smells a taste tastes terrible that is defitely passage specially for it it might be perfectly safe it is not tasty exactly  that's why people put these best before dates on he says for most foods best before dates will tell you if it's still fresh the best before is just a general message say well after this date we can't guarantee the quality  the product what types  food should we stay away from once they're past their best before date big ones are deli meats  st cheeses  meat raw meat because what they can do is have a potential to grow pathogens which we can't see we can't smell  the food becomes dangerous but other products are fairly safe thgs like bread for example yes it'll taste a bit more stale but it won't be too dangerous other thgs like pasta dry products like cookies best before dates can be important so how much can you trust them one grocery sider had lots to say she agrees to tell all if we protect her identity this former bakery clerk tampered with food for years what would happen to foods  the bakery that had passed their best before date it wasn't sellg we would cut the cake  half like this  then each half would be packaged on its own  each  the halves would have a new best before date put on it how long could those sit out for they actually had stickers on them for about two more weeks  then what would happen after a couple  weeks if it still hadn't sold we would actually replace that sticker with the new one so that's two additional weeks on top  the two weeks on top  the weeks that had spent  the display case she worked at a your dependent grocery store  Ontario before it was bought by Loblaws she says tamperg with bakery items at her store common practice with the fruit cup tarts  the display case we would take them  we would scrape f the fruit as it got older or less desirable lookg or moldy moldy he'd scrape f that yes then we would just reach op it with new fruit  we would reglazed it  then we would put it back  the display case until this fruit wasn't lookg very good anymore the boss said that was okay the boss didn't just say it was okay this is what we were structed to do  it wasn't just fruit tarts our sider says she scraped f fruit  re topped some cakes  sounds gross but could it be dangerous we buy some cakes  fruit tarts for lab testg I brought you some food products to take a look at but to our surprise when we open the box let's check out this cake it's a fruit torte Wow look at that holy cow this has not passed its best before datg there's already mold on it it's very already this is good this is Wow can't believe how much mold is on it yes hmm has this cake been doctored the store said it's not passed the best before date we asked Warrer to help us simulate what our sider tells us about what happens to cakes  tarts two weeks past their best before dates on day one  our test that moldy cake surprisgly still safe to eat but nearly two weeks later so these are yeasts  moles  you might see these orange ones here look pretty don't they yeah if you gest that tox what can happen well nothg will happen to you stantly but what over time it can lead to thgs like cancer so that this is why we have these bestbefore by dates rarely to stop these sort  thgs happeng yikes  he says the longer these toxs stay on foods past their best before dates more potential growth  risk  there's more this comes  the form  we'll call an entry bacteria which is a fecal dicator a fecal dicator on the torch on the chart that's a lot  hlg when you produce these stalks can troduce a third degree  Cody farms  other bacteria you found a lot lurkg on the surface  that torch it was I could see  microbes underneath the fruit it ready wasn't it the number back to you I amazed me as a microbiologist that even these microscope grow so high  a cave pretty disturbg almost two weeks past their best before date the fruit tarts are loaded with toxs  this is a specialist it's a mold that produces a mica tox which can be very fatal over the long period  time our sider says she didn't know there could be potential risks but why did she do it when you're workg there it's part  your job  you're told to do it  you're not really at a place  your life where you can take a st or say anythg about it so what's her advice for you I would personally avoid buyg any cake or pie or bakery product that isn't  its origal form if it's been cut  half or cut to smaller pieces there's probably a reason for it back on the street what do you thk one tip from these former workers is you should buy foods  the bakery  its origal form no it's an advice that I should start sharg a lot  my family members  friends that's a good piece  formation yeah that's defitely somethg I can use  the future Loblaws won't come on camera but after learng about our fdgs they tell us they've reforced their bakery policies with all their stores we wonder if what we're hearg is unique to the bakery department so we design a national onle callout  aleshia how's it gog good I'm just checkg out some  our results we hear from grocery workers who've worked at retailers big  small from coast to coast  the deli bakery produce  meat departments I have witnessed seafood that was expired be turned to chowder mix oh that's disgustg yep across the country they share disturbg secrets  what goes on behd the counter oh look at that one we would take unpackage pies cakes cookies  repackage them as a sgle servg dessert that's not good take a look at this one meat was rewrapped best before date was changed person after person is writg  about changg the best afford eggs that's shockg so as we were researchg this story it turns out one  our very own terns on marketplace used to work at a grocery store so I'm gonna meet him  hear what he has to say the hair used to work  the dustry what did you do with me that was past its best before day he gears up to give us a demo somethg like this they would take the dip it  blood just double it a little bit we've stimulated some blood here yeah so just double it like that  then as you can see it looks a lot redder that's what you do you would take the brown meat  turn it red yeah so we would turn it red  then if like aga we do it as many times as possible we just keep flippg it when it comes to our third question what's happeng  the meat department we here dog meet make over it's easy we would rewrite them  put down a new sticker which came with a new best before date that I extended the shelf life  you won't look at ground beef the same when you hear this if it's really bad if it's like this we would dabble  a little bit  blood throw it to the meat mcer with some redder meats  then altogether it would make it look red  then we put it back up on the shelf  people would buy this yeah yeah all the time sounds misleadg but can it be risky to food safety expert Keith Warner helps us recreate what we've heard is gog on with meat we mix meat that's four days past its best before date with new how does it smell I'll let you do the honors  good let's do good turn it on so how's this new blend look it's totally fresh likes well disguised yeah that looks good but could it be bad for you we send it f for testg the good the bad  the rotten we go to the core  a bestbefore a flashback it didn't look right  it didn't taste right did our cfeecups vestigation get your pot boilg fd out what Tim Hortons  Starbucks staff have to say this is your marketplace ready set it's a time bomb flashback 1976 funky fondue a few weeks ago mrs. Rita Clifford  Sudbury Ontario served a cheese fondue to her husb  their guests the fondue was quite frankly awful it didn't look right  it didn't taste right this is Clifford complaed to the manufacturer  she got her money back another satisfied consumer end  story not quite Joan's mrs. Clifford also received some terestg formation the fondue mix she bought was over three years old the lounge's company has not been makg fondue mix for almost four years  the ideal shelf life  the mix would have been under a year so next we call the Toronto fice  the TJ Lipton company as they hle the marketg  Blanche's products  Lipton's branch manager  you all about mrs. Clifford's failed fondue party but he didn't feel it could happen aga   fact he jokgly remarked I'll bet you $1,000 you couldn't fd another package  the stuff well we went to forest stores  Toronto  three out  four had the mix to Loblaws  the Domion  we figure that branch manager owes us about three thous dollars great that was then this is now  we're fdg some grocery stores are still playg games when it comes to best before dates would you eat this past the best before date no fruit what we're about to show you next might just change the way you shock food safety expert Keith Warner is helpg us test some foods siders tell us are beg doctored to extend their shelf life like grdg up meat that's four days past its best before date with fresh yuck I'm curious how it tested so what we found was the meat was actually loaded with bacteria after only one day it was loaded with these type  bacteria called entra bacteria see  what they do this is that these can break down the meat protes to make somethg called biogenic ames which are toxic chemicals which can cause asthma mood changes all sorts people who bought that me wouldn't know that it was spoiled because it been mixed up with the goodlookg me exactly was deception at its worst isn't it taupey unethical   this case ok if he goes beyond ethics doesn't it goes just safety  thgs like that the hair has experience workg  the grocery bills others we hear from he says mixg old meat with new happened all the time who told you to do this so the the butcher  my supervisor or a lot  times he'd brg it  for me he'd brg him like a stack  like like meats that were brown slam them onto him be like sahara unwrap these  relateable them stock them back up on the shelves so what advice does he wish he could have given his customers don't buy from the front  the shelves reach on behd grab this stuff  the back that stuff is usually a little newer back on the street we tell people about all that meat tamperg that's disgustg oh my god look that's their bike do you buy marated meats am i like marated fish do you consider it fresh yes I always thk it's more fresh it's like you like they prepared  the store that day see I put my trust  company might not be fresh it's not good so can you trust marated meat we hear from other siders cludg this Ontario grocery manager he says there's a secret reason some stores are addg sauces  spices to meat we've got some marated drumsticks here why is stuff marated thgs get marated if it's if it's gog f or it is f they will marate it to hide the odor  if there are any dark spots or whatever to mask that  then put it out for sale  thgs that are marade to actually sell for more you charge more for no stuff that has gone past its best before date yes was referred to as valueadded so because you're addg somethg to it it creases the price so  our store thgs like steaks strip lo steaks they were gog f they were expired essentially would be coated  some sort  barbecue marade or cracked pepper somethg with a really strong odor to hide the rotten smell what was the reason given for dog this it's all about prit  money  the health  the consumer is not really concern it's how much money I can make with almost ten years experience  the biz this siders got a tip for the next time you're out shoppg for meat I would not buy a pre marated meat or pre spiced meat  grocery stores because you don't know what has happened to it it could be fresh but it could also be expired product what tends to happen accordg to some siders the marated needs it's ten marated to kd  disguise the color hide the odor disgustg it's a fraud oh no I always just thought it would be the most freshman yeah earlier aha you should be honest with your consumer you want action we want answers Canadians want to be able to trust when they go to the grocery store that they're buyg food that is safe for them get our newsletter your cheat sheet to the news you need to eat or not to eat you don't want to miss this ready to engage we're gettg the goods on best before date siders from coast to coast tell us they're tamperg with your food store policies are beg ignored fal question when you see mold on food can you cut it f  eat the rest I thk so hell no far as I know you can cut it f I still you microbiologist Keith Warner says it's not as simple as you might thk if you see mold growg on a product is that safe to eat  thgs like bread it's safe but if you thk  a st cheese if you thk  jam if you thk  even a strawberry  you see these moles growg they could potentially reducg these toxs that diffuse through but this former grocery manager says old fruits  veggies sometimes get a second life any time you needed to make a fruit tray you might go out onto the counter  see what's out there maybe somethg is startg to turn  you would brg it back   cut f the part that is bad  then cut up the rest that looks good  then put it to a fruit tray did you actually see that happeng yes I did same thg happens with some vegetables so it happens quite ten okay what if I told you that hard food products like orange cauliflower or broccoli there's mold on it it's okay to eat but when we're talkg about st foods don't even take a chance no I didn't know that before I have actually cut strong mold f strawberries  fennyman so I didn't realize that shut the front door misleadg people about best before dates is illegal there are dustry stards for best before dates stores are supposed to selfpolice so there's no way  knowg how widespread these practices are not every grocery worker who answered our call out had stories to share but 1/3  people who worked  the dustry  the past 10 years the tamperg was gog on no surprise to retired public health spector Jim Cham what kd  stories have you heard about alterg best before dates I've been receivg complats from the public regardg you know when I buy a pill you know a product on it looks like somebody change or cover they are the best before date all people would say that looks like somebody change it by usg a pen or did you smudge it all those thgs people were questiong whether they've been tampered with it does correct he's been hearg about food tamperg for over 30 years how do you know those thgs are actually happeng where ten that we would do a spot check go to the meat counter or the food package counter right away  just to do the best to see whether those evidence can be collected yep it's ten hard to catch  the act so who is mdg the store we try for weeks to get an terview with the dustry group the retail Council  Canada but they won't talk on camera so with test results  h we pay them a visit hi there I'm Erika Johnson from  Marketplace hopg to see David Wilkes David Wilkes is the senior vice president  the retail councils grocery division we wait  wait fally he comes out to speak with us what specifically are you gog to do now that we've told you people are tamperg with best  four dates there's a risk here that people could get sick right I don't accept that the products that were changed or altered or there was issues around that there was safety concerns good employees are tellg us that they're beg told from the top down to fudge the best before dates it's comg from managers ten right  so I don't accept that premise Canadians are gog to be able to trust when they go to the grocery store that they're buyg food that is safe for them they can trust the the quality  the food that is  Canadian stores they can trust the food safety if we've discovered that people are beg told to fudge best before dates what steps have you taken to mediate that the steps were already  place the steps were  place beg followed we asked Wilkes if he'll pass on a message to his members you know a commitment to us today will you commit to gettg back to your member stores  tellg them they have to enforce the policies that are already  place because obviously that's not happeng I don't need to do that because those policies are already  place they're worse than nd I do not be followed  we agree to disagree that was terestg he heard our concerns  he said that basically these policies are beg followed  stores it's not what we found so what message do you have for retailers as a mother as a light we are puttg our trust  you so please help us you should be honest with your consumer I would say any company tamperg with best before dates don't do it it's not worth my help your favorite fish oil or prote powder really any good for you dietary supplements a capsule  prevention or a dose  height they're out there sayg take this will be a complete man a complete woman more than half  this prote is spiked they're basically cheatg the customers fish oil or snake oil none  the seven products that we tested met their label flame"
25,1.0,"My childhood days\n were spent  a village at the foothills  Mount Faber. re was only one TV\n  the whole village,  nobody watched TV. We spent our days\n either swimmg  a canal, climbg fruit trees\n to gather rambutans, or catchg spiders. I thk that\'s where I first developed\n my love for the outdoors. Jewel, for me, is like\n travellg back to my childhood. I get to do the thgs that I did\n as a young boy playg outdoors, lookg after plants\n  lookg for sects, lookg after the nature\n that’s  Jewel. Today, I have the entire outdoors\n  an door settg. That is really very fulfillg. In the wee hours at night, we still have\n concierge teams roamg around. What happens at night is that\n we’d look out for arrival guests, guests who are lost,\n who need our help. We also look out for guests\n who are sleepg. Yes, we need to check on them\n from time to time, so that they do not\n miss their respective flights. Excuse me.  guests  the day time\n are much more active. y have a lot more questions\n  enquiries, as compared to the guests at night\n who are much more sleepy. Usually, they won\'t ask so many\n questions at that time  the night. After hours, when our\n concierge counter is closed, if we fd a lost item, we\'ll h it over to our Jewel operations\n manager, who will file a \'found\' report. Mostly, we\'d fd gadgets\n like laptops, iPads,   particular, cell phones. When I was at Level 2 North,\n I found a wallet. re was around $700\n side the wallet,  the guest was very happy\n that I found the wallet. People thk that Jewel\n is very quiet at night. And yes, we do have\n fewer crowds  the eveng. But  the wee hours, there\'s actually\n a lot  activities that are still gog on. For example, the matenance team is still\n servicg  cleang our Ra Vortex  other attractions  Jewel. re’s also the lscapg team who is workg on\n our lscapg features. For us, Jewel actually\n comes alive after 10pm because the work that we have to do,\n takg care  the plants, has to happen after visitors\n have left the garden. It\'s almost as if the garden\n is alive 2 hours. When everybody else is asleep, we come to life\n  start matag the plants, makg sure everythg is good\n for the next day. We break to small teams. A group  people does the prung, some people hle\n the sect sprayg,  some hle the plant washg. Spray it evenly, make sure all parts \n the fern column get the water. We don’t want excessive water\n on one side. Spread it out evenly. To date, Jewel has been receivg,\n on average, 250,000 to 300,000 daily visitors. That number contues to grow. If you look through your Instagram Stories,\n Facebook feed, social media, you’ll defitely see our hero shots, our Shiseido Forest Valley\n  our HSBC Ra Vortex. se are the two attractions\n that people will defitely come for.  HSBC Ra Vortex\n lightsound show will be startg soon. Before every lightsound show, we will do what we call\n the preshow checks. This is to make sure\n all the equipment  systems that are supposed to be runng\n are functiong correctly. What we do is make sure the pump\n is runng with the normal range. This is to ensure that there is\n sufficient water flow to the acrylic sk. This is our ma water tank. This is where\n all the water collects. So from Basement 3, the water will\n be pumped all the way up to Level 5. Many people may not know this, but the waterfall water itself\n is actually treated, so it’s very clean. People come from all over Sgapore,\n  even from foreign countries, to view this unique  iconic feature\n that Jewel has to fer. We have to deliver at our end, to make sure that the guests get to enjoy\n the full lightsound show. Before the show, the team  I will go down to the site to do the preshow checks. Are the projectors turned on? We make sure that\n all the speakers are turned on too. We make sure all the pumps\n are  workg condition. Sometimes, the WiFi connection has\n a glitch, so we have to manage that. We have to fd\n the proper connection. This iPad controls the Ra Vortex\n  the thgs that go with it, like the fog, the lights,  all that. When I was hed the iPad,\n it stayed with me at all times. Wherever I went, whatever I did,\n it was always by my side. It’s more important\n than my mobile phone. This iPad really is\n my precious baby.  Ra Vortex system was created\n by an American consultancy, WET Design. In the begng, the American\n consultant was the only one who could hold this iPad\n  operate it. So ex  I had to work with them. We had to ga their trust over\n the course  two to three months before they actually allowed us\n to touch the iPad  control the\n Ra Vortex operations.  first day we held this iPad… I still remember the day,\n it was 13 April. ex  I, along with the consultant\n from WET, were walkg on Level 5,  the consultant felt the urge\n to go to the toilet, for some reason. That was when he hed over\n the iPad to us, an unficial hover. When he passed us the iPad,\n both  us felt very excited  we ended up takg a selfie. Yes, everythg looks fe.  lightsound show\n will run as scheduled. Durg the show,\n two teams will be deployed. One will be at the Forest Valley,\n observg the show.  other team will be down below, makg sure the servers\n  systems stay onle  are not faulty. People thk  the Ra Vortex\n as just a waterfall, but actually, there are\n many more elements to it, such as the lightg,\n the background , the speakers as well as projectors. se are thgs which the public\n won’t normally notice, but to our traed eyes,\n this is what we look out for. If everythg goes well  runs smoothly,\n we can go home  sleep easy, knowg that we have\n done our jobs properly. When I first joed,\n Jewel was still under construction. re wasn\'t any waterfall, so it didn\'t really impress me\n at that pot  time. But once they started to do\n the testg  commissiong, when they started\n to run the water feature, that was when it really struck me,\n  I thought, “This is magnificent!” For me, Jewel durg the day\n is all about runng the operations. But at night, I get this feelg\n  serenity  calmness because  its ambience. At night, it’s much more peaceful. You really get to enjoy\n the tranquillity  this place because it\'s designed\n to be like a forested area. We really get to be one with nature. Much  the work starts\n when it’s close to midnight. I want you to trim those\n that are slightly out  shape. It’s time for the olive tree\n to be given a nice haircut. One  the thgs that really\n left an impression on us was the plantg  the olive trees. That whole night, it took us six hours\n just to plant two trees because we didn\'t want any  the limbs\n or branches  the trees to break. And then, haulg them up\n from Level 1 to Level 5 was a very slow  paful process. It was a paful task. It took us a long time\n because we wanted to get it right, down to the smallest details like\n positiong the trees  such a way that gives people the best angle\n for viewg them. Here  Jewel, we have around\n 2,200 trees  palms, 100,000 shrubs from\n around 120 different species. To source for the plants, we went\n as far as Australia, Florida, Spa, Thail, Indonesia,  Malaysia. We’ve some terestg ficus plants\n called “Ficus snake form”. We got them from . We were travellg from\n one nursery to another,  along the way,\n we saw these beautiful plants. It was never  the plantg plan,\n so we thought we\'d just get them first,  later, we would decide\n where they fit  the garden. It turned out very well,  they\n fit beautifully  the Canopy Park. We are now side\n the water sk  the Ra Vortex. This is a view  Jewel\n that not many people get to see. As with all water features, people tend to make their \'wishg well\'\n wishes  throw cos to the founta. Whenever we fd cos, we will just\n put them aside for safekeepg. You need to be here at night\n to experience this. It’s very peaceful. You really have time to observe\n the Ra Vortex  its true beauty. re’s no one obstructg the view,\n so you really get to see how the Ra Vortex\n is such a complex system,  yet, it is so beautiful. As Experience Rangers,\n we manage the daytoday operations  all the attractions\n here on Level 5. After the park closes, we will do a\n thorough check on all  the attractions, such as the Mirror Maze. We have to check  make sure\n that there are no cracks  the mirrors, the area is clean,  the lights  sound effects\n are all workg. We just want to make sure that\n it\'s good for the next day’s operations. We’ll also do a thorough check\n  the Hedge Maze. We check for overgrown plants that may be juttg too far out\n to the pathway. If there are any, we’ll need to notify\n the lscape team to trim them. We have the walkg nets here. We will check all the ropes, make sure there are\n no sharp wires stickg out,  make sure all the\n metal components are  place. My first experience on the nets\n was pretty scary.  moment I reached the peak \n looked down, it caused me to freeze up. Luckily, I had a friend with me\n who guided me through it. I wouldn\'t have made it to the end,\n if it was not for him. Most guests seem\n very confident at the start. But the moment they start to look down,\n  this is five storeys high, many would just st still\n  refuse to go down.  Experience Rangers here\n are actually quite used to it, so they will fer them\n a helpg h. I once encountered a lady who,\n right from the start, was crawlg because she was too scared. So I went over to her\n  as we got closer to the end, I saw a guy filmg us. She said, “That\'s my husb!\n He left me on my own here.” Her husb was also\n too scared to help her, so luckily, I was there for her. When I was a kid, I liked to\n spend my time at the playground because that\'s where\n all the neighbourhood kids were. That was our hangout spot. My childhood playground had a net, so  a way, I get to relive\n some  my memories here. Workg here at a giant playground\n makes me feel like a kid aga because I get to play\n without people judgg me, without anyone askg,\n “What\'s a grownup dog at a playground?” We check the safety  the slides but at the same time, it\'s also an excuse\n to enjoy ourselves a little. After the park closes,\n when it\'s much quieter, sometimes, I will just spend a few mutes\n watchg the planes take f  l, which, I thk, is a pretty nice way\n to end the day.  difference between\n day  night flights is that we are a little busier\n on day flights  we get to teract\n with more passengers, while night flights are a little quieter\n  more tranquil. I am a very active person\n  I like freedom. As an air stewardess, flyg allows me to be at\n different places at different times,  on top  that,\n I get to teract with a lot  people across different cultures. One time, my colleagues  I\n were on board the tra. When the tra went through\n the Forest Valley  Jewel, we came across the Ra Vortex. Some travellers  the tra\n asked us what that was,  as it was also our first time seeg it,\n we were all  awe too. We burst out laughg because\n our reaction time was so slow. It took us around\n three or five seconds before we turned around\n to answer the travellers  tell them what it was\n that we just saw. After long periods  travellg,\n flyg for over 10 hours, when we see the lights\n  Sgapore  the airport, it feels really good\n to be back home. When the capta announces\n for us to prepare for arrival, it means comg back home\n to our loved ones,  gettg to enjoy\n our own local delights. Havg travelled so ten, I’ve come to appreciate the simple thgs\n that we have  Sgapore. I remember that when I was young, the Mara Square area was mostly sea,\n but now, look at the skyle. When you see it, you\'d thk,\n ""Sgapore has really evolved  changed over the years."" I thk that at the heart  it, that\'s what Sgapore\n is really known for. We revented\n what a garden should be. With Jewel, we revented\n what an airport could be.  travel  tourism lscape\n contues to evolve. Travellers are becomg\n creasgly discerng. y know what they want. y go out, look for,  discover\n all these hidden gems, to really get to know\n the destation. And there\'s always somethg new\n to love  discover about Sgapore. Sgapore by day\n  Sgapore by night. Sometimes, it’s two completely\n different destations. Beyond your bars  clubs at night, it\'s also a great place\n for families at night. re was the\n Sgapore Night Festival. At Little India, there was\n the Little India Art Walk. From day to night time, you\'ll defitely fd somethg\n that you love to do here  Sgapore. When we started planng Jewel, we were very clear that we wanted it\n to be a tourism product. We wanted to put it\n on the global map. We wanted it to be a place where... If you\'re a tourist from afar, you\'d want to come to Sgapore\n because you\'ve heard  this place. And I thk we\'re really overwhelmed\n by the positive response. We never expected to have\n so many followers on Instagram, although social media\n is the thg  today. People always ask me,\n “So, you should have a lot  pictures?” And the irony is,\n if you look through my phone, when I do have pictures,\n they\'re along the les ... “Look, this thg is crooked,”\n or “Why is the tree leang?” It’s all about what we need to fix. So I end up havg\n notsonice pictures  Jewel. Now that Jewel is complete,\n  I have less troubleshootg to do, there are more opportunities\n to take better pictures. I saw all the social media pictures\n  Jewel before I went, so I have to say that\n my expectations were pretty high when I first went to Jewel. And yet, upon seeg it up close, seeg it for myself\n with my own eyes, I was still very impressed. Sgapore has always prided itself\n on beg a garden city. Jewel is sort  like\n the climax  that. We want visitors\n comg to Sgapore  leavg Sgapore\n to have this image, that they have stepped\n to a garden city.  question I get asked most ten is,\n “Are the plants real?” I thk it’s because\n people are so surprised. y’re wonderg, “How did they\n manage to get so much greenery to an door environment?” This remds me  my childhood days\n when I’d catch spiders, just for the fun  it. But actually,\n I am now lookg for pests. You can see some mealybugs which is quite common\n on door plantgs. When the team  architects\n first presented the idea for Jewel,  they showed us these beautiful\n rendergs  the lscape  all, I thought to myself,\n “Either these guys are jokg or everybody here is crazy.” To be very frank,\n I thought it was near impossible because the biggest challenge\n for growg plants door has always been light. We need to get\n the light levels correct.  key to that was choosg\n the correct glass type, a glass that allows maximum light  but cuts out the radiant heat.  Jewel glass facade\n is very terestg. It comprises more than 9,000\n different glass panels  each  them is \n different dimensions. So each panel is special.\n It has three glass layers. It keeps the heat out,\n lets the sunlight ,  allows the plants to thrive. Cleang such a\n complex glass structure requires a lot coordation\n with different parties. More importantly, the people cleang this\n have to do it quadrant by quadrant,  work their way downwards. Currently, our projects team is\n dog the ternal facade cleang. As you can see, there\'re many glass panels\n  they have to clean it one by one. It gets quite tedious. It has to be done on a regular basis\n  order to keep the place shy. A lot  the cleang\n has to be done at night because that\'s when\n the crowd level comes down. That cludes the cleang\n  periodic works, such as high dustg, cleang those light fittgs\n that cannot be tackled durg the day. You also have escalator cleang,   course,\n let’s not forget toilet cleang. We have to do a thorough\n cleang  all the toilets.  attractions that are terestg\n to clean are the Mirror Maze, the Canopy Bridge,\n as well as the  Nets.  one that\'s challengg is the  Nets\n because there are three layers  nets. It’s a challenge to retrieve the items\n or the dried leaves caught  between the nets.  Mirror Maze can\n only be cleaned at night, when the lightg is low\n  the park is closed. At times, you might walk to a mirror. Now, I am cleang the Mirror Maze,  gettg rid  fger marks. When I first started cleang\n the Mirror Maze, I lost track  the way out as I was tryg to spot  clean\n every sgle fger mark. After three days, once I overcame\n the challenges  the place, it no longer posed a problem for me. Our central kitchen starts\n really early  the morng. We start at 2am,\n before anyone is up. We make all our kueh,\n each one is dividually hmade. y are hcrafted to\n these ty little delicacies. We have to make sure that whatever\n we make is real  authentic,  that\'s why we still\n want to do it by h. Our ondeh ondeh\n is still done by h, our kueh dadar is still\n dividually hrolled, our kueh lapis is still hlayered, layer by layer. That\'s why we start at 2am. It\'s to make sure that\n the best  freshest products go out to our outlets\n all over Sgapore. Our first trip out  the\n central kitchen is at about 8am,  then throughout the day,\n we contue to make the kuehs,  as the kuehs are done,\n they get sent out islwide, from Jurong all the way to Changi,\n   course, that cludes Jewel. Our store at Jewel\n is our flagship store. We try to make it a little different by usg elements \n Peranakan floral motifs. We’ve also used batik\n because that\'s part  our heritage. About one  a half to two hours. We also have a\n demonstration counter. At this counter, you can see how\n our kueh lapis is made, layer by layer, one layer at a time. That’s somethg that\'s a bit unique. Keep compressg it down, be sure to make it even,\n so that it is flat. Yes, it takes a lot  time. When Bengawan Solo started  1979,\n 0 years ago, we already have\n our pan chiffon. We’d get tourists from ,\n Hong Kong, Taiwan,  even Japan. y’d come here  would want\n to get somethg that\'s  local, so they’d get a pan chiffon cake. Travellers who come to our Jewel store\n to buy somethg from us… What we sell at our store here\n is exactly what you’ll fd at our stores  Ang Mo Kio\n or Toa Payoh. It’s really what Sgaporeans  locals\n have been eatg for generations. Food is an enormous part\n  Sgapore\'s culture, partly because we\'re immigrants. In those days, when people migrated,\n it was due to hunger, fame, or floods. And to be able to eat well\n was a sign  success. Everyone  Sgapore\n is a connoisseur. I thk you\'ll experience this\n even when you ride a taxi.  taxi driver is equally a gourmet  can tell you exactly\n how this fish is steamed. I thk that\'s amazg to many people\n from around the world. I thk that for Sgaporeans,\n food is actually the ties that bd. We have a photo wall that showcases\n our history  food culture. ong this section,\n which is very terestg, we have the chefs who are known as the “Four Heavenly\n Kgs  Sgapore food”. y came together\n to create yu sheng, which is our famous\n Sgaporean raw fish dish for Chese New Year celebrations. And here is my aunt, my\ue000 Mak Koh, teachg you how to pound\n while wearg a sarong kebaya, dog it  a very elegant way. In the old days,\n a potential motherlaw will visit the homes  girls\n  marriageable age  the morngs,  listen to the poundg, to determe if the girl can cook. If she cannot pound,\n it means she cannot cook,  therefore,\n is unsuitable for my son. We do feel a sense  pride\n  beg at Jewel. It is so important\n because this is the airport, which is a gateway\n for people to visit us. We want to fer a taste\n  some local Malay dishes, so we have satay,  we have fish curry,\n which origates from Little India. We are actually presentg\n the whole  Asia on the table. Bon appétit.\n Thank you. As a Sgaporean,\n personally, I feel very proud that almost half  the brs here\n are Sgapore brs. As Changi Airport  Jewel\n is such an ternational location, this is a good place to\n showcase these brs. “Sgapore meets the world\n  the world meets Sgapore” is a tagle that we\'ve\n always had for Jewel. One  the thgs that will really\n strike you, when you enter Jewel, is the lush greenery\n  the sound  the waterfall, as the water flows down\n from the Vortex. You see all this glass?  glass panels allow\n the natural light  durg the day, so we don’t have to make use\n  additional energy to power the lightg\n with the dome. Obviously, we look at thgs\n from the perspective  users. We thk  what they\n would like to feel  see when they come to\n such a beautiful place. If you walk around,\n you will see some robots that are located strategically\n around the mall. y serve you water  sweets. To us, they also serve as\n mi attractions. I am Peter. Every day, I patrol\n the dropf pot at Jewel. Whenever I spot immobile\n automobiles or loiterg lorries, my job is to get them to move on. No obstructg traffic on my watch. My name is Yoji. If guests need a thirst quencher\n while stayg at YOTELAIR, just give me a rg\n  I will come rollg along. Room service?\n More like robot service. Welcome to Jewel. Please select the \'stop\' button\n for a complimentary drk. And when anyone needs a cooldown\n or a pickmeup at the Canopy Park, just stop me for some water\n  cy. With our robots,\n the mute they appear, you will see people takg photos\n  just crowdg around them. To us, they are little stars. We do have a unique feature at Jewel, which is that our concierge team\n will actually perform. We have a colleague, Arv,\n who is a magician. Durg our trag, he told us that he loves to\n perform magic tricks as a hobby. So we encouraged him\n to showcase his talent on site. I just want you to say “Stop”.\n Whenever you want, just say “Stop”. Stop!\n Stop. Look at your card. Don’t show it to me,\n you can show it to your mum. Put it side. Okay, Mum, you can keep this.\n Okay, Mummy will keep this. I need your palm. I\'m gog\n to take a picture  your hs. This fellow is gog to\n pick out your card. Okay? Okay.\n I will put this . Look at this. Oh my god!\n Was this your card? This was your card, right? Yes. I\'ve been practisg magic tricks\n sce I was a teenager. I started practisg\n when I was 12 or 13 years old. I watched a lot  David Blae shows,\n street magic tricks  all that, so I became terested. When I come to work, I am so happy\n that I also get to do card tricks. Every day, I get to do this,\n so it’s not really a job. It’s a very good feelg to delight guests\n while dog magic card tricks,   turn,\n I feel twice as delighted. I want you to pick any card. You don\'t have to show it to me.\n Show it to them. I usually practise\n whenever I\'m free, such as durg my breaks\n  after fice hours. Whenever I can fd the time,\n I will practise. To able to work  also dulge\n  my hobby, that\'s a great thg. I will never stop dog this. It wouldn’t be there\n because it is  my pocket. Oh my god, good job! This is a photo  my baby. This was taken durg\n our preview for the public. I guess my baby was so amazed\n by the lights that were on display that he opened his mouth  kept starg at the lights\n for a good one mute. When I saw him open his mouth\n like that, I felt proud. I thk I will keep showg him\n this photo as he grows up, to make sure he remembers it. When I first started\n my job at Jewel, my son was newly born,\n he was just 10 days old. I was also dog my\n parttime studies at the university. So a typical day for me would be\n to arrive at work at 8:30am,  my day would end\n around 12 midnight to 1am. Basically, that was the most tirg\n  paful time. It was hard at first. It was difficult beg a firsttime mum,\n  also, this is our first baby. So, not havg him around at home\n was kd  tough. My wife, beg a supportive wife, made a compromise\n  actually came over to the airport to have dner with me, so that we could at least spend some time\n together  the course  the day. That was how I managed to balance\n my work with my family time. But at the end  the day,\n I felt that it was a good opportunity,  I was very happy\n that I was able to work through it. I thk the unsung heroes\n  deliverg this project have to be all the loved ones\n  the people  our team, the people around us who had to\n pick up the slack at home  really see us through\n the ups  downs. Those are the true unsung heroes. We refresh the garden every quarter,  the theme for this round\n is “Autumn”. So we will switch out the orchids\n  one  the orchid trees to fit  with the colours\n  the new season. We will change this first,\n it will take about three to four hours. Later, we will try to change this. Otherwise, we will tackle this tomorrow. In the weeks leadg up\n to the openg, there were days when we\n had to work till 2am or 3am, as we had to make sure that\n everythg was done correctly. I have a young daughter,\n under two years old. As I have to work nights at times, by the time I reach home,\n she will be fast asleep. So durg the day, I will make sure\n that before I go to work, I get to spend some time with her. At least, I still get\n to see her every day. Luckily for me, I have very good\n support from my family. My mum is the ma caregiver. This allows me to\n stay focused at work, knowg my daughter\n is  good hs. On a daily basis, I will walk around\n  check on all the trees. One  the trees that we have\n been monitorg is this tree. We have observed some browng\n on the tips  the leaves, so hopefully, it will recover soon. After we fished the Olevel exams\n  received our results, my secondary school teacher,\n who was very nice, sat a few  us down. He told me that the lscapg dustry\n would be a good fit for me. I was always very volved  sports  did a lot  outdoor activities. I was not a quiet sort  girl, so he felt that this would suit me. I guess I was a good girl. I listened to his advice\n  applied for the course, did my diploma, did my degree,  here I am, dog what I enjoy. Right now, we are preparg\n for Jewel\'s gr openg which is happeng\n  two days’ time. We are expectg\n close to 700 guests to jo us. Logistically, it has been\n quite a challenge because it’s the first time\n we are hostg an event with the Shiseido Forest Valley. Right now, we are on stage,  this where our launch\n mechanism is gog to be. Our guest  honour,\n the Prime Mister,  our VIPs will be pressg a button\n durg the ceremony. Jewel opened six months ago. But with a press  this button, it will\n mark the ficial openg  Jewel. One  the key highlights planned\n for the ficial openg ceremony is that we’ll try  surprise the guests by troducg a new\n lightsound show. It will revolve around a song that was\n written specially for this new show,  for the HSBC Ra Vortex. Dick Lee approached me\n  shared with me his ideas, his plan for the song that we\'ll write together. I have always been waitg\n for the right time  the opportunity to do\n somethg  Sgapore, for Sgapore to connect\n with the world, connectg different cultures  people. I was very much\n lookg forward to it. We thought  the image\n  the Vortex  how it would come together\n with the light show. We wanted to write a song\n that could be epic but at the same time, very timate. We will be unveilg\n a new lightsound show for Jewel’s openg ceremony. We are dog the fal fetung. I can’t tell you about it now because\n it\'s a secret  surprise for everyone. On the day itself, I will be the one who\'s responsible\n for launchg the show. It\'s a lot  pressure. We opened Jewel\n to the public  April. n we had the second phase\n  the Canopy Park openg  June. And now, we have the ficial\n openg ceremony  October. It\'s a ceremonious occasion. It is,  essence, a celebration\n  what everyone has achieved. Jewel’s ficial openg, to me, is like the openg  April\n all over aga.  preview period\n was defitely challengg. We all worked around the clock. We had to stay at YOTELAIR just so\n we could catch some sleep  between. Durg the preview week, we saw an estimated 600,000 visitors\n over seven days. Image havg 100,000 people come to the mall on a daily basis. It’s tense.  bs would be filled up\n every 15 mutes,  our crew had to, literally,\n run around with b lers  get the bs emptied\n as quickly as possible before they overflowed.  first few days after\n Jewel’s openg were really hectic. re were long queues at\n many  the shops  restaurants. Likewise, durg\n the lightsound show, there were big crowds\n around the Ra Vortex. Many  the travellers\n shared with me that they had flown to Sgapore\n just to see the openg  Jewel. At the very first lightsound show\n for the public, this was where\n we were watchg it from. I still can’t forget that day. I was stg on Level 5 with ex. We were watchg\n the show from there. Before the day  the preview, we were still fetung\n the lightsound show.  first show at 7:30pm... was the first perfect show\n that we ever got. Both  us were very nervous,  both  us were prayg that the first show for the public\n would go smoothly.  Forest Valley was\n really packed with people. In the end, everythg\n went accordg to plan. After the show ended, people actually\n gave us a round  . I thk it took us by surprise, but at the same time, it gave us\n a great sense  satisfaction. Setup will contue through the night\n  to tomorrow. We will be havg rehearsals,\n  after that, it\'s showtime. Today is the ficial openg  Jewel,\n  as you can see, we’ve already closed f the entire\n Forest Valley  preparation for it. Ladies  gentlemen,\n please put your hs together  warmly welcome our\n guest  honour this eveng, Prime Mister Lee Hsien Loong\n  Mrs Lee. Jewel has become one  the... stantly recognisable icons  Sgapore. Every facet  it is brilliant. Sgaporeans are proud  Jewel\n  rightly so. It resonates with us because it remds us that when we\n dream big  apply ourselves, nothg is impossible. Ladies  gentlemen,\n for this historic countdown, may I vite you to jo me, please. One, two, three! Who would have imaged that when we decided to shift our airport\n from Paya Lebar to Changi, that one day, we would make it\n the best airport  the world. May Jewel long contue to sparkle  brg joy to Sgaporeans\n  visitors alike. I\'ve been hearg comments from\n my friends from other countries. y\'d say, ""I hear there\'s gog to be\n this place  Sgapore called \'Jewel\'."" When I saw it for myself,\n I was very excited because I felt that\n this is gog to be a place that the whole world\n will want to visit, just to experience it. I thk what\'s great about Jewel is that... it\'s also our airport. To me, I feel that\n it checks plenty  boxes,  terms  what Sgapore represents\n  what Sgapore sts for. It\'s really enjoyed,\n not just by visitors, but also very much\n by Sgaporeans themselves. I want to say that\n no other country’s citizens feel the same way about their airports\n as Sgaporeans do. We\'ve always set out\n for Jewel to be a place where people can build\n fond memories. Jewel’s ficially open! Cheers! I thk the team that was\n volved  Jewel’s openg was defitely passionate\n  committed.  fact that today, it has become\n an icon that\'s symbolic  Sgapore makes us all very proud. It’s a wrap! This is a picture  my parents. se are my mum, my dad,\n  my husb, who visited me when\n the Canopy Park first opened. One  the memorable thgs\n that I want to share is this moment when my parents\n came over to me  said, “I don\'t remember\n what you look like anymore.  only time I can see you is when\n I literally come to Changi Airport  meet you for dner.” But after they came over\n  saw the openg, I thk they were filled with pride. y then understood why I was puttg\n so much time  effort to this. I was spendg\n a lot  time at work, cludg many late nights\n  the Ra Vortex, workg with the\n American consultant. My mum actually felt that I was\n spendg much less time with her. When my mum first came to Jewel\n  saw the Ra Vortex, she fally understood\n what her son was workg on,  she was proud  her son. That is me. When we first opened Jewel, friends whom I’ve lost contact with\n for the last 15, 20 years suddenly found me  said, “I saw your work at Jewel \n I thk it\'s fantastic.” That was nice. Jewel helped me\n to get back  touch with friends whom I’ve lost contact with\n for the last 15, 20 years. re\'s a gynaecologist\n whom I see from time to time. Every time I see her, she will say, “You know, I am so proud  you. I\'m gog to tell my other patients that I know the girl who does\n the lscapg  Jewel.” I thk she is really\n very proud  me. One  the comments\n that I remember vividly was about feelg very proud\n to be Sgaporean, that Jewel has become\n an icon to the world,  that the team behd Jewel\n did a good job. Seeg comments like that\n makes me feel that... all the late nights at Jewel\n are worth it.  ficial openg ceremony\n defitely feels like one milestone, like it marks the end \n all the opengs that we\'ve had. But it also feels like\n the next chapter. It\'s time to decide on the attractions\n that we want to refresh. It\'s time to plan\n the first Christmas,  before long,\n the first anniversary. It\'s just the first chapter\n  the book.  consultants  architects\n have done their part to help us realise this dream,  now, it is up to the team  me\n to carry the baby forward. It is not gog to be easy. It\'s gog to be very challengg.\n We look forward to it. Every day is gog to be\n a different day."

rest  it let me show you our beautiful 19th century dg room oh man this Wow so this is 19th century yeah this is origal 19th century dg room it stayed untouched for more than hundred years so here always used to be parties who is the origal owner  this the house was built for each merchant he used to trade watches  cou look I'm sure you have to do some repair work from time to time to that but we are gog to keep as it is so the people can feel the atmosphere nowadays a lot  busess gog on with Chese companies  big companies small companies   course when the people comg to work here they want to show the country where they're workg they will brg all like families  relatives  friends you know today we hear a lot about the New Silk Road  global media how has that impacted old Silk Road cities like bukhara sure I thk that the more more  more people will come to the Bekaa Stan because it's a more publicity about the Silk Road  the last three or four years because it's a big publicity about the Silk Road about Rebecca Stan  more  more visitors from  visitg our country do you have plans to cater to the Chese tours I thk we will hire the person who will speak Chese  we probably will translate our web page to the Chese language 's Silk Road is acceleratg change  Central Asia  change has come not just from tourism alone Central Asia  the mds  the Chese is the buckle  the belton road  many dustries here are beg transformed how important  Central Asia to the overall Belton Road itiative I thk if we look at the map we can fd out the importance  the Central Asia  API because it would be the first to stop for  to go out from  on the zone  the earth belt  also Central Asia region is a very very important area not only for Chese economy especially for Chese our security what's best  I still need to was a very important country  Central Asia  also what's biggest an has a breakg the relations with   also post with Russia so I thk it'll be okay but very very important there is a more important dynamics for 's washer  a regional peace  development it's not just the ancient cities that are changg Tashkent the country's capital is also gettg a makeover I'm headed there on a highspeed tra from ty oasis town  the second century BC to Tashkent a thrivg modern metropolis with two  a half million residents this place is now Central Asia's biggest city [] there is a legend that Tashkent was halfway between  where all the silk was comg from  Europe its destation Tashkent is the seat  government  Soviet architecture is evident everywhere that's because whose Becca Ste was part  the Soviet Union up until 1991 on that year the Soviet Union broke apart  Islam Karimov became president  the newly dependent country but his rule  more than two decades was marred by allegations  corruption  human rights abuses activists were locked up whose becca stan was relatively closed to the rest  the world kerimov died  2016  now the new admistration is tryg to do thgs differently a fiveyear plan has been put  place to turbocharge the economy that has been stagnant for years now the excitement can even be felt  the marketplaces here at a carnival a man is about to lift the 300 kilogram camel with his teeth the strongman is ambitious so too is loose Becca sts new government [] [] the government announced its fiveyear plan  2017 the plan is around five different areas  those areas  course are coverg a wide range  issues startg from the political system reform  fishg with the economy social life  others are you confident it can be achieved  course I would be honest with you as a citizen  Uzbekistan two  a half years ago I wasn't a member  the government yet but I was rather skeptical or cautious about whether we would be able to achieve all those goals but nowadays I'm very optimistic Pakistan today is conductg very serious reforms  I can even compare that with my Japanese or Chese historical periods when they had the openg up so so we are  a quite historical moment right now the new plan together with 's belt  Road itiative is expected to brg monumental changes to the country not only has the Uzbek government signed some 15 billion u.s. dollars worth  vestment deals on jotly developg the country's oil gas  uranium fields the two governments also agreed to cooperate  buildg railways road networks telecommunications frastructure  dustrial parks Chese our major trade partner at the moment   course when we are talkg about vestments especially foreign direct vestments  is also number one whose Becca Stan has captured the world's attention this is the largest underdeveloped Central Asia market  Central Asia still 70%  the vestments go to Kazakhstan  beg as Pakistan second with 16% but  nowadays Pakistan is becomg one  the big players because  the first  all we have the one  the biggest markets the most dense country  the region  with 32 million population  course it's a big market for vestors a few years ago foreign journalists like myself wouldn't even have been allowed to work here but now the country is welcomg to both media  busess you can feel it  the air the country is on the cusp  change  it's an excitg time to be here I'm travelg on 's Silk Road  Uzbekistan  this is the capital city Tashkent one major aspect   Silk Road arts railroads  has built railways across the world  here  Uzbekistan yet another ambitious rail connection will soon be underway but before I head to the new railway there's an old rail system I must see man look at this metro station whose Becca Stan has a proud history when it comes to railways this is the tashkent metro built by the soviets  1977 it was Central Asia's first urban rail le [] it still is one  the most stunng metros anywhere [] there are 29 stations each with its own unique architectural theme for a long time there was a photography ban on the secret railway stations that's because they served another role as nuclear fallout shelters whose Becca sts metro stations were important military stallations it was only  2018 that the photography b got lifted allowg journalists like us to brg you these gorgeous images there's one dedicated to cotton the country's ma export one to use Beck rulers  old  this one is dedicated to more otherworldly aspirations it's the cosmonaut station [] celebratg space travel the stars  everythg celestial with an array  murals  glass  light shows that confound the md [] [] here is a patg  Gagar the first man  space  he was Russian this whole station feels very cool  dark  evokes this feelg like you're  outer space the Russians did a decent job gettg the city  Tashkent connected but it is the Chese who helped connect with Beca Stan to the world news Beca Stan is one  two only double llocked countries  the world do you know the second one say Kazakhstan no that's Liechtenste Europe okay  double  low country means that we have to pass the borders  at least two countries to reach the sea so all our neighbors are also llocked countries  we are double  locked country so for us the logistics transport corridors these are very important that belton wrote itiative it basically focuses on retroduction  all these you know connectivity between Europe Asia so that the goods can you know be easily transported from the Yellow Sea for example to the Europe  who's Becky stan is just  the center  this route  September 2016  augurated a railway le that runs through is becca stan to afghanistan  pakistan now it wants to build another le connectg who's becca Stan to Kyrgyzstan  onwards to  the railway lkg Kabul which is capital  Afghanistan  Peshawar which is  Pakistan  this will allow us to lk the whole railway system  Central Asia CIS Europe with the South Asian railg railways Pakistan India  this will  course open enormous opportunities you know unprecedented opportunities for boostg trade between different regions  the world especially  the Eurasian content this is what built an Road itiative is about then Uzbekistan will be fully plugged  ah  course I mean after that we will not be concerned so much about our double llocked status  we will become like Liechtenste these railway lks will have a huge impact on dustry  one dustry is perfectly poised to prosper [] cotton from which these clothes are made is Uzbekistan's thirdlargest export earner after natural gas  food agriculture the country is one  the world's largest cotton producers cotton is so important here that it's called white gold on any given month 3,000 tons  cotton gets exported from Tashkent ASEAN   along the Silk Road that's enough to make 10 million tshirts [] to see how all this fashion is made I've come to one  the country's largest textile companies check out all this cotton hi Omar hello I drk good good good to meet you so this is the factory huh yes  this is step one  the long journey from bloom to fabric whole purpose  the department is to clean the quarter so this mache is defed cleang mache so it'd be like movg particles like maybe dead sects  dust yeah it it takes some black particles blue rats the computer scans the cotton for these particles  they get mechanically extracted the next step is to comb the cotton Automation supercharges this otherwise tedious process fally clean this like as how you comb your hair okay so the fiber basically are formed  this mache  then fally you see a product this right here yeah because here we don't have the twist  the fibers for the next process is where we make we go towards the spng process we have they twist six slivers are twisted to one thread from start to fish it takes five days  volves many maches  hs  that's just to make thread how much cotton does it take to make let's say like your tshirt no this okay now how has the belt road itiative how has that impacted your busess the fashion dustry is growg fast   fact every dustry is dog dog fast so everybody needs the the products  time so defitely better for the itiative it gives up great frastructure for the producers to supplier to their guests Just In Time strategy so shortly it will reduce your capital vestment over your stocks so you can make planng with lower stocks  your warehouse  get the products fresh products just  time if you are  the geographical position where your delivery times are more defitely you will attract less customers due to your delivery time even if you are producg very high quality the output  this goes back factory feeds 's satiable dem for cotton  remas the world's biggest clothg exporter despite risg labor costs it's the New Silk Road that's helpg  stay on top  the textile trade major brs require fashion to be fast which means that runway trends should be available  shops  less than a month as  2017 about 90%  all fast fashion worldwide is transported by either see or rail  it's the belt  Road  its openg up  new global lks  appendages that's helpg suppliers cope with growg global dem it's makg it faster for cotton  Uzbekistan to wd up  's textile factories to be transformed to a piece  clothg  reach the stores you shop  nowadays even if you talk about the fashion dustry it's gog very fast so everybody needs to have new thgs very fast  to react overall to display change the frastructure is very important the New Silk Road will set up sweepg changes not just  the fashion busess but across dustries some trades are up for the chop [] [] this is tour su bazaar Tashkent bestknown market the dome is one  the city's most iconic lmarks an impressive settg for an equally impressive showcase  people  produce on the move look at all these carrots they even chopped it up for you  now that's convenient [] see this looks like cheese right it's actually blocks  cow fat the food here is trigug but it's  the fruit trade where the sweetest deals are beg made many Chese companies have stopped importg American fruits because  the uscha trade war many have turned to Central Asia to get sight I'm meetg with the man responsible for whose Becca Stan's food exports you are see here we export to all over the world ok for example this premium class present we export to  please try out sure oh yeah oh very nice do you like it it on yes but we have other fruits as well now we'll go to fresh fruit stuff currently we are exportg fresh cherries to  ah ok  what other fruits  vegetables are you hopg to export as well was based on planng to have the permission  export to  for fresh produce like apricots fresh melons hmm  then I hope that by step we crease our fresh produce exports to  such as plums peaches whatever other fresh fruits that  Marx will like I hope we'll export that is Russia your biggest customer yes Russia's current our biggest customer but very soon we'll access to  market  is ten times more bigger than Russia market is then the volume will be bigger than what currently we are exportg to Russia I see so you're hopg to make  your biggest market then yes  the many facets discussed about the belt  Road itiative the focus on agriculture is ten overlooked yet food security ranks high on any country's agenda   is no exception  is currently grapplg with a dauntg conundrum how to feed nearly onefifth  the world's population with less than 1/10  its farml for example the Chese eat nearly three times as much meat as  1990 to keep up with dem they have had to diversify food imports accordg to a Chese national action plan under the belt  Road itiative provces  western  will work with Central Asia  fruit gra  animal husbry pros Becca Stan which depends on agriculture for about a quarter  all jobs the Chese plan spells opportunity what is this this is Uzbekistani 1,000 years old oh wow it's made  rice  tasty meat  carrots raiss you know this dish looks a lot like biryani yeah so I'm sure this recipe must have travelled along the ancient Silk Road yes it is a travel from who the central truth Becky Stan  you can fd the plots with a different recipe  every provce  Uzbekistan  also  different parts  the world for example  Turkey pilaf they have  Afghanistan well it looks very tasty  I'm starvg so let's go try it out yes so back to our earlier topic yes how has 's belton Road itiative impacted the agriculture sector it is boostg our agriculture sector because the market is gettg water  water  we're importg from  new agricultural machery the new novations new seeds  new technologies comg from  from by usg this one belt  one road strategy now our Chese companies come here to is becca stan  vestg  the agriculture busess yes they are vestg a lot they are vestg  different parts  agricultural sector from seedg up to processg storage  logistic accordg to Xhua news 's total food imports amounted to 58 pot two eight billion US dollars  2017 the figure rises 25 percent yearonyear experts believe that if current growth rates contue  will become the world's largest food importer Chese companies have already been buyg up l  water resources along with dairies

kdergarten is also popular amongst the locals it is itiatives like this that w hearts  mds on 's Silk Road to thank the kids for their time I brought a special treat this is compliments  [] [] [] [] this is the Tashkent campus  the management Development Institute  Sgapore the school was set up  2007 today it caters to about 2,900 students so why did you choose to study here at this school personally I choose this  because  the variety  programs they fer this is the only place  was back east on to study risk  management that's why I came here what do you thk that was Pakistani economy is gog I would say we entered a new phase  our development because for last like 20 25 years we've been lookg for stability now we enter the phase when we want to see changes there are plenty  changes reforms  taxation system  fancial systems now we tryg to make our country even better to rice what are your thoughts on the belt  road itiative now I have some  my friends who who's studyg Chese now  lookg for partners   already because when the itiative will start brgg this a new organization it will be very competitive  if you have now some one partner   that will be great for example  other local universities people are or has already started learng Chese Mar some  our students are right now started like workg logistics  right now our university actually provide MBA program for supply cha management so I thk it's a good itiative for us the belton Road itiative was launched  2013 itially it was Confucius Institutes funded by  that fered trag opportunities related to the Bri now many dependent  statefunded schools all over Central Asia are also tweakg their curriculum to support the needs  the Bri sgaporean Andrew Chiu who heads the school has lived here the last three years so what do you thk are the prospects  the uzbek economy who's Becky Ste is a developg country it's an economy that has a lot  potential for example  terms  tourism that's an area with a huge potential to be tapped on but before they can do that for example they need to really improve the frastructure they have to improve the processes they have to do this very quickly very systematically very methodically  over a very short timeframe one  the top tourism sites  Uzbekistan is Samar Khan  I've heard there is a huge belt  road itiative by  to help the Uzbek strap up their tourism frastructure here but before I discover the details  this plan I need to underst the city's history some Archon was a vital stop on the ancient Silk Road where Chese traders met their Persian Arab  European counterparts but it wasn't always fair trade legend has it that  the year 751 the secret  papermakg was obtaed from two Chese prisoners here this led to the first paper meal beg set up outside   the vention then spread to the rest  the Islamic world  from there to Europe beg a rich tradg city it was also fought over by many powers it was conquered by genghis khan  1220  also at one time a Tang Dynasty Protectorate but it was team or one  Central Asia's most famous historic figures who gave some mark on these magnificent buildgs [] Timur claimed an empire  his own  the 1th century a territory that stretched from South Asia to the Middle East extendg all the way from Delhi to eppo he sed millions  sent the skilled artisans  craftsmen back to his capital here at some mark on [] today thouss still come to his tomb every year to pay their respects cludg that was Beck's Special Forces it is believed that team was a great conquer died while on his way to wage war agast the mg emperor  the year 105 timor had gathered an army  200,000 men to vade  the Timur was 69 years old already at the time  he never made it to the borders   nowadays it is the Chese who come to see him  it's not just the tourists a few blocks away from Tim Moore's tomb Chese architects are hard at work under the Bri Chese urban planners are workg to redesign Samar Khan  it will be paid for by the Chese silk road fund choice  the tall bounnam poor where you should see this some typical Hana villages are  Selenia somehow shakily untie my beanie  there you go hung the Macario shitty my each so

provce  Viet Nam's Northwest it's famous for its rice terraces  lush green mountas which are among the tallest  the region but I'm not here just for the scenery my journey to explore 's new Silk Road has brought me to the capital  this picturesque provce which shares a border with Jaco an autonomous County  's Yunnan provce I've been greeted with wet weather upon arrivg here but for the people  Lao Cai provce their ray days are now far behd them thanks to   this is why over the past few years Lao Cai has been at the forefront  Viet Nam's trade with  the border between Lao Cai  Jaco which means River mouth  Mar is located right at the convergence between Viet Nam's Red River  's Nancy River  every day vast numbers  goods are transported over these rivers via three different border crossgs by rail  by Road but those without the luxury  wheels have a different border crossg experience one that's a little more hectic I mean it is literally a race across the   it happens every day look at them go carryg whatever they can  their baskets  trolleys sometimes a little too much these farmers  vendors from the nearby Vietnamese hillsides are all competg to be the first to reach the local hook hole markets where spots to sell their goods are not fixed but grabbed based on a firstcome firstserved basis it's a  because those who arrive late to the Chese markets probably won't be able to sell all their goods  they'll be makg that return trip back with full baskets  empty wallets  that is a walk  shame no one wants to make fortyfiveyearold vegetable sellers shem takes part

itiative but the question on many observers mds is whether the recent MOU would lead to any further substantial collaborations so far not any project come from that itiative  you're not like many other countries they already have some displacement from the IRB I thk not because  two reasons number one Vietnam  the process  development  we change yeah man the frastructure development especially sce the launch  the one belt one Road plan  has repeatedly emphasized that the itiative is not just about vestg  frastructure it also hopes to use the New Silk Road to promote cultural exchanges between the Chese  communities around the world  le with this goal Beijg cosponsored the construction  this statetheart buildg the  Vietnam hip palace was ficially opened by Chese President Xi Jpg himself  November 2017 this massive mural is what greets you when you enter the palace  it depicts a very vibrant cultural exchange between the two countries   Vietnam  it showcases the various ethnic groups cultural performances  it really encapsulates what both governments seek to achieve with this venue the 35 million dollar buildg is decked out with the most modern equipment  facilities it has everythg you'd need to hold meetgs dialogues  parties between the two sides but sce it opened about a year ago there hasn't been any  that happeng just yet [] donjuan for me is the vicepresident  the vietnam union  friendship organizations the stitution which runs the place at the moment the palace is not under full operation as some  the technical check ups adjustments have to be made but activities like cultural events performances exhibitions language classes traditional medice receivg visitors from vietnam  cha those kd  activities will happen at a time when there might be certa strong feelgs towards cha  the region how important is it for organizations like you to kd  create a bridge between let's say vietnam  cha the attitude  the vietnam is to work together to address issues  with disputes over the isls that belong to vietnam we are determed to contue workg with other countries especially cha to address accordg to ternational laws  by peaceful means diplomatic channels with peace is key to development  prosperity while we wait for the  Vietnam hip palace to ficially open locals elsewhere  Hanoi have already taken it upon themselves to promote Chese cultural activities  their community take hai for example he's a former national athlete who was sent by the Vietnamese government to  to learn wushu when he returned he set up this Taiji Club  Hanoi now he's impartg those same values  philosophies he learnt about the art form to his students [] mostly John McCa  dangler cheaply MZ Wang no archg Lakai the lot up to the mounta Chile sangjoong rate up  a

its public emits a growg protest culture but stories like that  highs do fer some hope it's an example  meangful peopletopeople exchanges which is a key pillar  the belt  road itiative [] progress on that front is already  high gear across the border  Laos where Chese  lotions now collaborate  many dustries from construction to film production the Chese might be wng Lao hearts  mds  the process but can their money help Laos where it matters most to fulfill the llord's emissions to the osteons next vestment hotspot [] I'm on the fal leg  my journey along 's new Silk Road  Indocha  today my travels have brought me to be  10 the capital  Laos but before I beg my journey explorg 's growg footprt  the country I'm gog to take a slight detour to check out a proment vientiane icon [] it's the first stop for any tourists comg to the city  the most important national monument  town the battousai Laos Arc de triumph as tour guides call it seems to be iconic  ironic fashioned after the one  Paris the Batu Sai is a tribute to Lao soldiers who bravely fought  died durg the country struggle for dependence agast the French French  Indo Chese fluences spire its design  the cement that was used to build it all was donated by the United States the Americans thought it would be used to build an airport thouss would have an arc stead the city's older residents call this a vertical runway just nearby another monument has a less complicated context I'm not only terested  box side but also what's next to it here's a water founta donated by the Chese government a symbol  Chese friendship right  the heart  Laos  history a sign  the deep ties that the two countries share [] nearly 15 years sce the fountas stallation the relationship between Beijg  its southern neighbor is stronger than ever because  what's happeng elsewhere  the country there's a constant flow  Chese money to Laos  that's slowly turng this developg country to an vestment hub  has vested  everythg from hospitals satellite ternet  television to shoppg malls [] []  when it comes to malls the m10 Center bill two years ago is currently the newest  biggest  the country it's five hectares  anythg  Vientiane cityslicker might ever need cludg a Sgaporean style food court domated by Chese food stalls this mall is actually pretty small compared to malls  other capital cities across ASEAN like Bangkok for example however I must say that this mall looks pretty sleek  modern  as the first fully airconditioned retail  entertament hub  the city it fills a critical void  Laos society especially for its youth that's if they can afford any  this the average lowchen earns just a little more than 200 US dollars a month what this new mall is really sellg is a new middleclass lifestyle that's very aspirational  very excitg  I wonder if those aspirations are with the reach  most locals I'm meetg Miao jeongwu he's the general manager  North namche undeveloped Mh the malls parent company as the manager  this mall what is your observation b do you fd that the typical allowg customer or guests to the mall are they able to afford the majority  products that you have for sale here yes I thk the majority  our products they affordable for them like for stance just for one noodle one lunch you can go like 20,000 deep  us is around two  a half dollars so affordable  the fold the clothes the price is around a hundred thous deep so  dollar it's gonna be like 15 okay 15 to 20 dollars so it's not expensive  your opion would you describe the majority  your customers is maly beg maybe middle class I thk yes middle class because before the more openg for the people who won't get middle class products there's no place for them to shop  that so they're gone across the border to Thail [] shoppg wasn't the only attraction that drove oceans to time malls there was also this other fix lotions do love their movies  with the openg  this cema on the top floor  the tense center many have been spared the hassle  crossg the border to catch the latest Hollywood flicks this five Hall Ceplex boasts the most modern theatre facilities  the country  it's on par with any modern cema  the region this is easily the most popular place with the mall especially among the youth tonight a woman oh so you like a girl I'm told that  addition to local  Hollywood films the cema also screens Chese movies which have become very popular among the lotions but lotions are not just watchg on the big screen they're also watchg  the comfort  their homes  it's not just movies but Chese TV dramas as well which are a big hit  Laos there's such a staple among WoW households that an entire dustry has emerged dedicated to convertg them for audiences here Salian has one  the most famous voices  Laos he's been the goto dubbg artist for English movies for more than 0 years now but these days Sally young  his audio engeer are gettg much more work comg from Chese content there's much more dem for them thanks to TV platforms like lhasa a chese run satellite TV service based  vientiane why do you thk there's been such a strong dem for Chese films  TV dramas among Wow audience kyoko company

have audiences who are learng Korean to follow the Korean dramas or they will watch the series  the origal language let's say like Chese  then have the subtitles  their own language why do you thk that lotions want to watch Chese film TV dramas dubbed   mouth I'm hobby Joe could not I know Kalani Haji well if it's updated miss allowg coloboma I know it's a lie college market boom boom look at my phone no yeah but you manicotti wha lamella yeah no no me  as a team like a number now ponte from malls movies to manufacture []  has pumped billions  dollars to Laos over the past five years makg it the largest foreign vestor to the country  much  this vestment is concentrated  a multibillion dollar mega railway that will lk Laos major cities to 's Yunnan Provce but will this mammoth project plunge the country to a debt trap [] [] as a llocked largely mountaous country with many  the population livg  poverty Laos has for years been perched high on the United ions list  least developed countries  an attempt to graduate from this list the Lao government has sought billions  dollars  aid  frastructure vestment from  this has helped Laos develop critical frastructure  places it on track to become osteons next vestment hotspot [] I visit a Belton Road project that seeks to brg Laos closer to realizg this goal through the Belton Road itiative  has poured record amounts  capital to their less wealthy southern neighbor one  their more proment projects is this one thus I set a development zone which was jotly set up by the vientiane municipal government  the Yunnan construction  vestment Holdg Group it's mostly a vast vacant plot now with just over 0 factories but once construction is complete this thous hectare plot will be more than your usual dustrial park there are already plans to build schools hospitals apartments shoppg centers  even tourist attractions Leo who is chairman  the Laos  jot vestment company the consortium responsible for developg this zone he saw the strategic value  settg up a special development zone  Laos early on we hiko can tune up  out so you could other chairs on the kocha no matter how cool yet to show Tom Verducci talkg with part

to take shape  while both the Lao  Chese government's hope to draw on the success  this zone to elevate Laos prile as an vestment hub they are faced with one critical challenge Laos own geography with its majestic mountas  green valleys through which flows the mighty Mekong River Laos fers some  the most breathtakg views  Southeast Asia but these natural wonders are also its greatest curse the terra makes travel across the country difficult  that has long deterred vestors I visit the site  a six billion dollar Chese project which promises to help Laos solve this perennial problem [] the key to the success  the susceptor development zone is transformg laos from a llocked to a l lked country  here's how  is helpg Laos achieve this as you can see construction is already underway  Luang Prabang for a 1 kilometer railway le lkg  to mal Southeast Asia when completed the railway has the potential to help Laos boost transhipment come by pluggg the country to the broader belton road network [] this is just one  dozens  tunnels that are beg built to allow tras to cut through Laos numerous mountas  they won't just be passg through mountas but across rivers as well here  Luang Prabang a massive bridge is beg constructed over the Mekong River which will eventually be lked to the tunnels while I can certaly see how Laos sts to benefit from all this connectivity I can't help but wonder about the impact  all this construction on this heritage town [] Oh Melissa by tball somebody sabaidee my upon is a staunch supporter  the project because  the hundreds  jobs it is created for the local community cludg himself he works for the Chese railway construction company as the capta  this barge the barge transports trucks  construction supplies across the river every 30 mutes along with creatg jobs chitta pond service also benefits his fellow villagers who travel on the barge for free passes on go OD Tolyatti oh come on ya go buddy seeg  they come hanoi to confirm with guy oh I thk I know I've been here soon  how was your life changed sce takg on the job  pilotg these barges they were how they my youtube mean he'll I saw we remember YouTube me if you have a couple can be some love  how soon before volume when DJ's a Michael Kay mcclenney Banta cho youngnam because once it works about a pieman hat  nap you know you one guy  kyun my mom  dad said well sir by me not fight no banquet here kabocha me while the mega railway is beg celebrated by many  the local community it has also attracted skepticism the project is funded almost entirely by loans from   with the country's total public debt currently at 70%  these GDP Laos is  critical danger  beg set up for a debt trap with  batteng Sghania who works  the Laos Chamber  Commerce feels that the costs are justified  the name  progress you know you look to the long terms you know development so we have moved from this llocked okay to learn lked itiatives  I thk that  as a way although is a big vestments but I thk is a way that can help I don't thk that it's just the only way but it can be one  the options that can help so I thk connectivity is very important  that's the reason maybe the government has decided to go although it's very big project  it'll cost a lot  a public debt  neighbourg vang vien faith  the mega railway project is equally strong there's a tra stop plan for this riverside town  that's raised optimism among the busesses here ever sce construction began many foreign vestors have also set up shops  restaurants  anticipation  receivg more visitors  more busess once the railway starts runng Tong Fung a Chese entrepreneur was quick to jump on the bwagon he runs a tour agency specializg  outdoor activities such as kayakg  buggy rides already his busess attracts close

I've seen firsth how Chese vestment has improved the stards  livg for many communities throughout the region but I've also seen cases  how these success stories have come at a price for the locals there are still challenges that states with ASEAN need to address eventually with  despite how much Chese vestment is beg celebrated the new Silk Road fers many opportunities to collaborate  I would

31,0.0," last time, at least  the\nUS, any car company achieved mass manufacturg was about a hundred\nyears ago  then Tesla.  issue is defitely not comg up\nwith a car design, it is absolutely all about buildg\nthe production system.  difficulty  value \nmanufacturg is under appreciated. It\'s like relatively easy to make\na prototype  extremely difficult to mass manufacture a vehicle\nreliably  at scale. In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called\nTesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would\ntransform the auto dustry. Founders Mart Eberhard  Marc Tarpenng\nset out to redefe the electric car. Cars that everyone\nwould want — affordable, environmentally friendly  fast. ir master plan started with a\nlow volume  expensive but allurg electric sports cars. In 200, wellknown entrepreneur \nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk vested millions  his own money\n eventually became CEO. You\'re not just buyg a sports\ncar, you\'re actually helpg pay for development  the\nmass market vehicles. In less than 10 years,\nTesla released the groundbreakg Roadster, Model S  Model X, all pavg\nthe way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk \nTesla looked unstoppable. Tesla has received almost four\nhundred thous orders from its latest car, the Model Three Sedan. But over the next year, the\ncompany struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturg\nwoes, fancial losses  volatile decision makg\nfrom its CEO. This has been an credibly\nlong  difficult journey. It\'s been an enormous amount\n blood, sweat  tears. Today, Tesla forges ahead with\nlty promises  new vehicles, despite endless lawsuits, mountg\ncompetition  consistent manufacturg goals. But   doesn\'t\nseem to md. Tesla now at session highs. It is up twenty one percent for\nthe day above ne hundred dollars a share.  ambitions have never been\nbigger  the stakes have never been higher for Elon\nMusk  Tesla. We created Tesla to make\na difference  the world.  world desperately\nneeds sustaable transport. We want to show that electric cars\nare  fact, better than gasole. Tesla was founded  2003  they\nweren\'t founded by anyone who had any automotive experience. It was consumer electronics, stware\n battery tech guys. When we started Tesla, there was\ntwo thgs  the world everybody knew about electric cars, they\'re\ndead  they suck. Nobody wants to drive one,\nthat\'s why they\'re dead. y\'re slow, short range. y\'re ugly. If you look at the\norigal busess plan we wrote for Tesla, we describe  great\ndetail the Tesla Roadster. And we said once this car\'s successful,\nthe next car we should make, it\'s either a large SUV, an\nexpensive SUV or a large sedan.  sedan market\nis enormously large. It\'s much, much bigger than the\nsports car market, the Roadster market. And then below that is the\nsort , you know, Model 3 segment  that market. And if you\'re gonna\nhave a big impact, you have to play there. But you can\'t\nstart there because the capital requirements are just too vast \nyou don\'t know what you\'re dog. You know, you have to learn \ndevelop the technology along the way. Everythg was hard, everythg. We were ventg from scratch. This was somethg that\'d\nnever been done before. We had customers literally say, like,\nthis is the most excitg thg I\'ve been volved , even though on\nsome level they just wrote a check, but they believed  the\nvision enough to write that check. And now they\'re participatg  this\nprocess that we were gog through. And then\nwe encountered Elon. Mart  Mark knew that the\nonly other person, perhaps lunatic enough to start somethg this ambitious\n jo the sort  EV mission with them would be\na guy like Elon Musk. Part  the PayPal mafia, he had\nmade a good deal  money  stware, payment tech,  sold\nthat company to eBay. And he was out  Southern\nCalifornia workg on an equally ambitious busess, SpaceX. One  the great thgs about pitchg\nto Elon  this context is that, a lot  times we would pitch\nto the VCs  to other, you know, angels  they would say what\nyou\'re tryg to do is so crazy. You know, you\'re tryg to make\nan electric sports car, that\'s sane. And we are pitchg to\nsomebody who is actually tryg to make rocket ships. And so,\nyou couldn\'t really say that. Right  context, Hh was like,\noh, yeah, I got that. Now next, we have Mart Eberhard, who\nis the CEO  Tesla Motors. And  course, this is one \nthe great cars, Tesla Roadster, an electric car that gets two hundred\n fifty miles per charge. A test  this one. You hear how silent it is. re\'s no sound. You can have a car\nthat\'s quick  you can have a car that\'s electric. But havg one\nthat\'s both is how you make electric cars popular. I was voted f the isl\n  a rather rude way. When I left Tesla, we had\njust, the Roadster was essentially fished  I\'d been dog nothg but Tesla\nfor five years  I thought it\'s gonna be another five years. And Mart wasn\'t there anymore,\nit wasn\'t as much fun. Sports car maker Tesla Motors. Reuters is reportg this Silicon\nValley electric vehicle is planng to go public soon. If it does,\nit would be the first U.S. automaker to go public sce\nFord did back  1956. Tesla is best known for its\none hundred ne thous dollar all electric Roadster. At the time Tesla came to us\n the government, they were actually lookg for a loan  order to\nbuild their first facility to create sedans. We ended up lendg Tesla\nfour hundred sixty five million dollars. And the real premise  that\nwas to be able to get that dustry, the electric car\ndustry, up  runng. And even to this day, I would\nargue that we wouldn\'t have hybrid cars  electric cars to the extent that\nwe had if this had not proven out to be a successful\ntransaction  a successful busess opportunity. If we were just makg the Roadster \ndog powertra busess, we\'d be pritable as a company, but we\'re\n a massive expansion mode.  latest model  the electric\ncar is rollg f Tesla\'s assembly le  California today.  Tesla Model S, delivery\nstartg today  Fremont, California. Tesla is showg f its newest\nvehicle, it is called the X. Tesla unveiled its\nSupercharger network. Musk says Tesla may start construction on\nthree sites as well for its giant battery factory\nor Gigafactory. You don\'t just want to be bettg\non this stock, you want to be pushg all  on Tesla. For vestors, Tesla has been a wild\nride for a lot  reasons. If you look at the history \nTesla shares, they really took f startg around 2010 all the\nway up through 2013. That\'s when Elon Musk first said, I\'m\ngog to build the Model S  then I\'m gog to\nbuild the model X. And he laid out a game plan. And when the Model S first came\nout, people might have been skeptical beforeh. But when the reviews came \nthat this is a solid vehicle that changes the game plan  terms\n how far you can drive an electric vehicle  what it feels\nlike to drive an electric vehicle, that\'s when shares \nTesla took f. Over the last couple  years,\nshares  Tesla have been extremely volatile. People sometimes get carried\naway with our stock. You know, honestly. If you care about the long term Tesla,\nI thk the stock is a good price. If you look about the\nshort term, it\'s less clear. Well, I\'ve been callg\nit a cold stock. I said last night it\'s\nlike a wide receiver. I mean, you want them  your fantasy,\nlike what am I gog to say? It\'s a fantasy\nstock that\'s reality. I thk we have to contue to\ntake a wait  see mode. Tesla is so highly\nvalued at this pot. You know, Tesla is still a small\ncar maker  a small niche market.  problem for some vestors when they\nlook at Tesla is that they see a company that contues to\nburn through cash  they constantly are askg themselves, when will this\ncompany turn a prit  susta a prit? It\'s not enough to be pritable for\none quarter  the eyes  some vestors. y want to see a\ncompany that is solidly pritable quarter after quarter\nafter quarter. Tesla has been  its stock. It\'s been a story stock. re\'s been a lot , you\nknow, sentiment  positive sentiment around its CEO  founder, who\'s\na massive holder, 22 percent ownership  Tesla. Elon Musk has made himself to\nthe face  the br. Tesla fans love him \nfollow his every busess. Mr. Musk, how are you? Congratulations on the promotion. Thank you very much. Those Merl enges are fantastic. Oh thank you, got an\nidea for an electric jet. You do? Yeah. n\nwe\'ll make it work. I really deeply believed  the vision\nthat the company had  the vision that Elon had set,\nwhich was acceleratg the world\'s transition to sustaable energy. That\'s what spired me to jo. And I thk that\'s what spired\nmany people at Tesla to jo. I did get to meet Elon a\ncouple times, which was so excitg.  first time I ever saw him, he\nwas wearg a Duff shirt from  Simpsons, their beer br. And I was like this dude\'s cool. I already know that. Where you from, boss? Michigan. Oh Michigan, you\'re \nthe car busess? Uh no, no. Prtg. Elon Musk. Elon Musk? Tesla Elon Musk? Yeah. Wow. I love space. I love the idea\n space exploration. So all  his\nSpaceX stuff fascated me.  solar power, just pretty much\neverythg that Elon has done, I absolutely loved. So the idea  workg\nfor him  havg his name on my paychecks was just\nso cool to me. What an honor to meet you. I\'m such a fan  Tesla\n SpaceX, all your companies. I\'m Howard Wolowitz, Caltech. Nice to meet you Howard. To\nthe extent that Tesla benefits from Elon\'s many side projects,  SpaceX\nis not a side project, SpaceX is a massive focus for him,\nit\'s a big, serious company. I thk you could probably\ncategorize Borg Company, Neuralk, OpenAI, Hyperloop, Pravda  a memes\nweb site, whatever else is comg out  his\nimagation as side projects. But there is an argument that what\nis good for his celebrity is good for the company. People see him\nas this great visionary genius that\'s very to the details  all\nthese companies, when  reality, I really see him as a great champion\n these causes  a great motivator  people  a great\nidentifier  talent,  he relies on these people to keep\nhis public perception alive. But some vestors question whether\nhe has enough operational expertise  focus on Tesla to lead\nthe company  the role  CEO. Elon Musk has some\ngood news for you. He tweeted a cheaper massmarket Tesla\nwill start at thirty five thous dollars.  company will\nbeg takg preorders for the Model 3  March. Don\'t get too excited, Musk cautions\nproduction won\'t beg for about two years. n gog from the S \nthe X, we fally come to we\'ve come to step three or the fal step\n the master plan, which is a mass market affordable,\naffordable car. Do you want to see the car? Well, we don\'t have\nit for you tonight. I\'m just kiddg,  course. Or you will not be able to buy\na better car for thirty five thous dollars or even close. One astonishg thg about the launch \nthe Model 3 was how many preorders came  immediately after\nthe company unveiled this.  total number  orders for the Model\n3  the past 2 hours has now passed a hundred\n fifteen thous. We found dozens  people\nled outside the automaker\'s Chelsea showroom, hopg to put their name\non the list for $1,000 dollars. Potential buyers can reserve one\n Tesla\'s new affordable vehicles. I got up at   the morng to\ncome here to put money down on a car that I have not seen\nbecause it\'s a Tesla. Model 3 could be the first model\nthat really opens up electric cars to the masses, to the mass market.  reason I say that is Tesla\nhas gotten hundreds  thouss  deposits on this car, the likes\n which, numbers that is, we\'ve never seen happen\nwith electric cars. It could be a tippg pot not\njust for Tesla, but for the automotive dustry.  Model 3 was\na huge turng pot for Tesla because they\'re startg to get\nto economies  scale. Manufacturg a car that is tended\nfor the masses stead  your early adopters  people that want\nto drive a beautiful sports car is a completely different affair than\nmakg a niche high end vehicle. Now how are we\ngog to make these cars? OK. Good question. Gog from\nannouncg a vehicle to actually buildg it, it was a very short\nperiod  time, so short that I thk Tesla realized this is not gog\nto happen as quickly as we expected. Tesla had lots  pressure,\nto produce a low cost car. And as soon as the design \nthe vehicle was at least viable enough to show the public  viable enough\nto know that it could be produced, it was released\nto the public. Most manufacturers don\'t release cars\nthat early, they don\'t release the whole vehicle, they don\'t give\nspecs, they don\'t give prices. When that happened, the manufacturg part,\nhow to build the car, was first really beg thought . So when, when are deliveries? Well, they\'re next year. So I do feel fairly confident\nthat it will be next year. Welcome back, everybody. Today, Tesla\nis makg the first deliveries  its Model 3. And this is\nthe day that Tesla fans  customers have been waitg for.  delivery\n the first Model 3s.  first  Tesla\'s Model 3\nis gettg delivered over the weekend, but most buyers will have to wait\nat least a year before gettg behd the wheel \nElon Musk\'s latest creation. Production grows exponentially, so \nAugust there should be a hundred cars, September\nabove 15 hundred. And then what happens after that? Well, eventually, by the end \nDecember, the production rate, at least accordg to Elon Musk,\nwill be twenty thous vehicles. Thg that\'s gonna be a major challenge for us over the next\nsix to ne months is how do we build a huge number  cars? Frankly, we\'re gonna be\n production hell.  Model 3 was expected to be \nmass production by the end  2017. It wasn\'t. It was a disaster. And so you had for a year,\nproduction hell where Tesla was strugglg to just build these cars for all\nthese people who had deposits down. When I said manufacturg hell \nsupply cha hell on Friday, I meant it. I mean, you know, but we\nknow this, signed up for it, not blamg hell, because we\nbought the ticket. One  the thgs which I thk\nTesla does which is maybe a detriment to it, is it tries to\ndo everythg itself  house. In the Model 3 process, we decided\nwe were gonna build cars better than any other auto manufacturer out\nthere stead  just buildg what was sort  dustry\nstard  guaranteed to work Tesla\'s plan for novatg manufacturg\nwas all about technology. y seem to thk that humans were\nthe problem  that if you just had robots  there,\neverythg would be better. We did go too far on the\nautomation front  automated some pretty silly thgs. We tried to automate\nthe placement  bondg  fluff to the top  the\nbattery pack, which is ridiculous. So we had Flufferbot, which\nwas really an credibly difficult mache to make work. Maches are not\ngood at pickg up pieces  fluff. Tesla eventually removed most\n the automation that delivered parts to the le,  they ended\nup gog to an dustry stard  movg them by pallet  fork\ntruck  thgs  that nature, because it was way more reliable,\nhad less issues  complications  terms  brgg\nit up to scale. We started runng Model 3 a\nlot, I would say, NovemberDecember  2017. FebruaryMarch we started ramp, the ramp\nup  Model 3  we started runng a lot  Model 3s. re were probably 500,000 orders  the\nModel 3, so we knew there was a lot  pressure under\nus to get those cars out. A lot  us, I thk, were willg\nto do what it took to get those big numbers out because we really\nwanted this company to succeed. In the process, they were so desperate\nto get that back on track, they ended up buildg a\nfactory  a tent. y ended up makg this outdoor\nle that is one hundred percent done by humans. re\'s no robots. y don\'t they don\'t do anythg. We have a couple hydraulic lifts,\nstuff to help assist us with puttg tires on the car, puttg the glass\non top, but it is an 100 percent manual le for\nthe Model 3.  company is under tremendous pressure to\ncrank out as many cars as possible. And so it creates a\nworkplace that can be very chaotic, that is, you know, makg\nchanges on the fly. You have workers who are beg\nthrown to positions where they say they haven\'t been traed for. y\'re gettg hurt on the job. y\'re workg tremendously long hours\n they\'re strugglg to keep up with these dems. I myself had two stances \nheat exhaustion, one which was taken care , the other one which I\nwas left to basically suffer it out until I literally walked f the le\n went outside for 5 mutes because I looked like\nI\'d taken a shower. And I was  my pat suit\n I was soaked through  through. I had to walk out\nbecause I was sick. I got written up for it,\nfor walkg f the le. Even though I had 20 text messages\nto my boss tellg him, you guys are gog to carry me out\n here on a stretcher. I thk we should scrutize them\nif they\'re really dog somethg fraudulent  they\'re dog like\npunishg people or slavg them. But thgs happen at the workplace. Workg conditions are hard. When I worked at Tesla, we worked at\nthe end  the assembly le  a room that had\nno ventilation, no wdows. We had, you know, crappy\ncereal, we had crappy cfee. I\'m not sayg no one cared. But most people were not sayg, well,\nthat\'s not why I\'m here, I\'m not here for the cereal, I\'m\nnot here for the cfee. I\'m here to change the world. y were supposed to be buildg half\na million  those cars a year at the Fremont factory by the end\n 2018,  they still aren\'t there yet. As they\'re tryg to get the Model\n3 production f the ground, Elon Musk makes a gr announcement that\nTesla is gog to acquire a busess that he also\nhelped cound, SolarCity. n there\'s Tesla today, ferg\nto acquire SolarCity,  this stock deal valued it up to $2.8 billion. Musk is the chairman,\nthe largest shareholder  both companies, as you know, \nhe\'s callg the combation a nobraer. We thk there\'s really a\nhuge opportunity here to have a highly tegrated, sustaable energy company\nthat answers the whole sustaable energy question from generation\n power to storage to transport. What is with the\ntimg  this deal? We\'re also talkg about SolarCity\nshares, which are perhaps not nearly as high as they have been\nover the course  the past couple  years. l I can say is\nthis, that SolarCity would have gone even lower if he hadn\'t made this bid. On paper, what Elon Musk\nlaid out made sense. He was gog to use SolarCity to\nramp up sales  solar panels at home to push the development \nsolar technology that could be used  a number  different venues. That hasn\'t happened. This is sort \nthe tegrated future. You\'ve got a electric car,\na Powerwall  a solar ro.  key is that it needs\nto be beautiful, affordable  seamlessly tegrated. I thk we really started to\nsee some  the the wheels come f, no pun tended,\nwith the acquisition  SolarCity. And that, I thk, really brought\nto light how tertwed Elon\'s personal wealth, personal terest, ego\n br were  this company.  directorships  others\n the potential conflicts are quite significant. Lyndon Rive, who\'s\nthe CEO  counder,  Peter Rive are brothers,\nthey\'re both Musk\'s couss. John Fisher\'s fund is a SpaceX\nvestor,  course, another Musk company. Jeffrey Straubel is a Tesla\nemployee  a SpaceX vestor. Nancy Pfund was a director at Tesla\nprior to it havg gone public. By the way, Tesla did an\nferg six weeks ago, those shareholders must not be particularly happy, though\none wonders whether he had any idea he was gog to do this. It just felt a little bit too\nconvenient that Tesla got to absorb this company that he had funded \nwas run by his couss  was gog to add enormous fancial\nstra to Tesla  enormous complexity at a time when it already\nhad a lot  complexity to deal with. This is the worst corporate\ngovernance I\'ve ever seen  my career  a company.  SolarCity bailout is just an\nabomation  they should be held to account for that. And they\nshouldn\'t be liable for that, because it was nothg but a bailout. Let\'s stay focused on SolarCity. I mean, I love Tesla by the way, I\nown a Tesla myself so it\'s  love the car, but lets stay focused. Exactly. Tesla has gone from production\nhell to delivery, logistics hell. That tweet was  response to\na customer complat about a delivery delay. But  truth, if  fact\nthat\'s the case, that is progress for the company. One problem for Tesla\nas it\'s tryg to deliver these vehicles is that they\'re supplyg\ncustomers around the world from one plant  California. Other automakers rely on outsourced\ndelivery companies that will take your car from the factory to the\ndealer  make sure everythg\'s  good order. Tesla\'s dog\nit all themselves. In fact, they don\'t\nwork with dealers. y run all their own\nstores  service centers. We had wanted a Tesla for a\nlong time  we were pretty excited about it  it just made\nsense for our new commute. But we took delivery  the dark \nwe didn\'t really get to see the vehicle until the next day.  next day I took it to work,\nit was a bright, sunny day  unfortunately it showcased what was\nan absolutely horrendous pat job like, I have no idea how they\ngot it f the le, how they would put it to the\nhs  a customer. I mean, it was sane. Now the\nTesla has hundreds  thouss  cars on the road  they\'re\ngog after a mastream consumer stead  just early adopters. y have a much\nhigher service burden. And the problem is they haven\'t\nreally scaled service  tem with that. I was fed up with Tesla\ncompletely to the pot to where today, if they want to touch my\ncar, they\'re not allowed to touch my car. I\'ll do my own\nwork on my car now. As soon as I exceeded my\nwarranty period, the help, kdness, teractions all went away. I was treated like I didn\'t\neven really own a Tesla. So  terms  the service part\n Tesla, I do get nervous. When many owners try to schedule\na service appotment, the service centers are stretched th  appotments\ncould be weeks out before a car gets to service.  reason why I started my YouTube\nchannel was to kd  demystify Teslas  general. Tesla wasn\'t\nreally sharg much formation about them  terms  what\'s side\n them  how they worked. So I figured to myself, people\nmay actually be terested  this. So as I started tearg to the\ncar more  more, I started takg detailed photos \nthgs, detailed videos. This blue connector goes\nback  the door. And just kd \ntook f from there. This is my Tesla parts storage. This is where all the used parts\nor crash parts, I save every little piece. I worked at Tesla from May\n 2009 through February  2013. I started out as a service\nmanager for the Seattle area. Part  the reason people are\nhavg trouble gettg their cars repaired is there\naren\'t enough parts. Now specifically with the Roadster,\nthere aren\'t any parts. And with the newer models, there\njust isn\'t enough parts comg f the assembly le or beg reproduced to\nfix the cars that are  the body shops. re\'s a local body shop\nhere that has, at times, has over 100 Model 3s\nthat need pat work. I have no problem with\nthem beg vertically tegrated. I have no problem with them runng\nthgs the way that they do for cars that are  warranty. But if they want to be \nthe mass market, unless they\'re gog to run every sgle service center \nevery sgle little small town, there\'s no way it\'s acceptable to\nhave people for mor issues drive  kill an entire day to go\nto the service center  get free Keurig cfee.  genesis  the\nelectrified garage was such that a lot  people started reachg out\nto me because  the YouTube channel, people that wanted to get\nissues resolved with their Teslas. And at the time, Tesla was super\nbusy, they didn\'t have time to get people  for appotments. So they started reachg out to me\n sayg, hey, Tesla\'s too busy to take a look at this or I\nown a salvaged vehicle, can you take a look at my electric vehicle? We\'re hopg the dem is really\nstrong  we\'re hopg to grow this to more  a franchise\ntype busess  almost work alongside Tesla to actually repair a lot \ntheir vehicles as well, because at this pot, they need all the\nhelp that they could get. One thg Tesla has done to\naddress the gaps between service centers that may be far apart  hard\nfor customers to come to is to launch this mobile ranger service. se are technicians that come to\nyou, customers who can get their issues fixed by the mobile service\nlove it, but they can\'t do everythg. Over the last year, Tesla\nramped its service locations by about 20 percent. And aga, Tesla is expectg about\na five fold crease  the number  cars that it\'s\ngog to be shippg. So we\'re just not sure that the\nramp is gog to be significant enough. Service totally matters\nto Tesla\'s longterm success.  proposition for the customer  a\nModel 3 is buy at your own risk. This might\ncome with problems. At the scale it is at now with how\nmany Model 3s that are out  the market,  who its core customer\nis, there are enough people out there to buy it with that caveat,\nbut that grace period isn\'t gog to last forever. And so Tesla does\nneed to sort these problems out before it becomes  mastream. I talked to a lot  people who\nhave Tesla vehicles  service is a problem. And you know, everybody\'s, ""Oh\nTesla service is a problem."" Microst had no customer\nservice for years. Google had no customer\nservice for years. Apple customer service, until they\ngot the stores, was mostly nonexistent. Right? This is not a Tesla unique\nproblem, this is an dustry unique problem. Technology companies aren\'t\ngood at service, period. Stop callg out Tesla for this\nbecause they\'re a tech company. y\'re not really a car company.  cheaper models like the Model\n3, they\'re all over the place. You just have to have a service.\nTesla needs to step up  provide them that service\nthat they deserve. And if they provide the\nservice they deserve, Tesla\'s unstoppable. Let me tell you, this is gog\nto blow this staircase out  the water. I mean, this car will\nleave a Ferrari  its dust. I thk Elon\'s Eloness has\ncreased over the years. Yeah, I mean, if you wanted to\ndescribe Elon Musk  a nutshell, I don\'t thk he would\nfit  a nutshell. It\'s like Elon Musk has been beamed\ndown from another planet to show us mortals how to run,\nhow to run a company. Elon Musk is a divisive\ncharacter because he\'s a difficult personality. Sometimes he\'s extremely chummy\n he\'s the best person to be around. And you love his\npots  view  his opions  the thgs he says,\n he\'s actually funny. Other times, he\'s a complete dick. re are times when he\nis arrogant  obnoxious  sultg. Of the reservations that\nhave actually opened  made available to configure. Can you let\nus know like what, how, what percentage have actually taken\nsteps to configure? We\'re gog to go\nto YouTube. Sorry. se questions are just so dry. y\'re killg me. How many executives\nor top executives have left this company  the\nlast couple  years? By some estimates, it\'s between 0 \n50 who have left the company under Elon Musk\'s watch over\nthe last couple  years. Most people confuse Elon\'s management style\nwith his vision  a sense. So what Elon\'s tryg to do\nis tryg to spire people to come work on a\nreally difficult problem. In my opion, at least he runs\nto issues, is tryg to do that while at the same\ntime matag operational excellence. I\'ve been on a couple  meetgs\nwith Elon Musk where people that have disagreed with him have no longer,\nyou know, you never saw them the next day for gog that way. And that\'s what Elon Musk does. We\'re gog that way  either you\'re\ngog that way or you\'re not gog. He\'s a great novator,\nhe\'s a great visionary. I don\'t necessarily thk\nhe\'s a great leader. I don\'t even have a desk or\nan fice anymore, I just basically, I\'m just basically stg on the\nproduction floor  occasionally meetg  a conference room. We have seen\nhim at the end  the le wearg a Tesla tshirt  steel\ntoed boots  safety glasses  bump cap, workg with the\npeople, dog the physical labor. When the S  X were launched,\nhe was, he literally had a sleepg bag at the end  the le\nbecause he didn\'t even want to leave. He was there so ten workg on the\ncars just to make them right  to make sure that they were as\ngood as they could possibly be  that production was workg. He was there all the time. He\nslept there  it was true. If your CEO has to be fixg\nproblems on the production le, no matter how brilliant he is or how\ngreat his solutions are, there\'s a systemic failure that\'s taken place\nto reach that pot.  whole pot  runng a giant\ncompany is to make sure that the whole thg runs as much as\npossible  an orderly fashion, an efficient fashion,  a pritable\nfashion, without requirg the constant personal attention \nany one person. He should fd a partner as quickly\nas possible who serves the same role at Tesla that Gwynne Shotwell\ndoes at SpaceX, a stabilizg force  makg that company made up\n humans who have to work together as good as\nTesla\'s cars are. Another Twitter rant\nfrom Elon Musk. This time it\'s\nabout media companies. He accuses them  hypocrisy \nsays the public no longer respects them. Elon Musk, for most \nhis career at Tesla, has embraced Twitter. He believes it is his\ndirect way  communicatg with customers, with fans, \nto take on critics. I thk Elon spends too much time\nobsessg about the media  the media\'s views on him.  media has mostly been\nextremely helpful to Tesla. It\'s free marketg for\nthe company, essentially. Tesla has a lot  fanboys who\nhave their own kd  media setups, whether they be fluential Twitter\naccounts or YouTube channels or blogs that don\'t do anythg except\ntell the world how wonderful Elon Musk is. So we tend to have a lot\n people that are huge fans  a lot  people that just hate us. And I\'m hopg over time we can\nconvce some  the people that hate us to hate us less. I don\'t thk that we felt that\nproduction was gog to kill the company as much as, I thk\nif anythg, we thought that Elon\'s stupidity with Twitter would\nkill the company.  race to rescue a teenage soccer\nteam stred  a flooded cave  Thail contues.  options to get them out are few,\n all  them are quite risky. He called a guy with\nprobably zero basis a pedophile. He called him out on Twitter.\nHe repeated it to the media. se are not the behaviors\n some milquetoast, traditional chief executive. We start with the tweet heard\nround the world, or at least around  . CEO Elon Musk\ncreatg chaos with a sgle tweet, quote, ""I\'m considerg\ntakg Tesla private. Four hundred twenty dollars fundg secured"",\nwhich led to the stock soarg  then beg halted\n then soarg once aga. Let\'s go to Leslie Picker. With\none tweet, he created stock price movements  huge amounts\nboth up  down. Let\'s get right to your top money\n busess story this morn g,  that is Tesla.\n stock is tumblg. It is down almost\n10 percent right now. It\'s all on news that broke\nlate yesterday, the SEC sug the company\'s CEO  founder,\nElon Musk, for fraud.  SEC alleges that Elon Musk\nmade false  misleadg tweets  August where he said he was\nconsiderg takg Tesla private at four hundred  twenty dollars \nthat fundg was secured. Let\'s get to our corporate story \nthe morng, I should say,  the weekend. Tesla founder  CEO Elon\nMusk  the SEC, reachg a settlement deal. He gives up the\nchairmanship for three years. Two new dependent directors will be\nappoted to the Tesla board. Both Elon Musk  Tesla\nboth payg $20 million fes. And this is the\nmost terestg one. re will be oversight by a\ncommittee  Elon Musk\'s communications. I guess this means we\'re not gog\nto get as many Twitter bombs  the middle  the night as we\'ve\nseen over the last couple  years. That was a 20 million dollar tweet. That\'s 20 million dollars that could\nhave been doled out  pritsharg or any other way. You saw the confrontation with\nthe SEC, which whenever entrepreneurs  the valley start attackg\nthe government or regulatory authorities or traditional stakeholders\n a way that\'s counterproductive, it ends up beg a\nbig problem for a company longer term. It shows that they\'re\nso looped to the vision that they\'re not thkg about the\npragmatic operation  functiong  the busess. He\'s got an oversized\npersonality which gets him  trouble on Twitter occasionally. But he also has a vision \nhe\'s pushg not just his employees, but he\'s pushg the dustry. Tesla shares tankg Friday after a\nbombshell terview with CEO Elon Musk. Shares plungg 9 percent right\nto a bear market, aga on track for its worst\nweek sce March. Billionaire Elon Musk  Tesla \nSpaceX fame Like we\'ve never seen him before. Smokg pot on YouTube. Tesla CEO Elon Musk appearg on\na podcast with comedian Joe Rogan last night, overnight. And yes, he smoked up. Take a look. So is that a jot? Or is it a cigar? No. OK. It\'s marijuana\nside  tobacco. OK. So it\'s like posh pot tobacco. Yeah, you never had that? Yeah,\nI thk I tried one once. Come on, man. You probably can\'t because\nstockholders, r ight? I mean, it\'s legal,\nright? Totally legal. OK. How does that work? Do people get upset at you\nif you do certa thgs? I\'m not touchg this stock\nat this pot  time.  stock has clearly not found\nits footg by any stretch. Elon is absolutely f his rocker,\nwhether it\'s tweets or whatever he\'s recently dog. I mean, maybe the pressure is gettg\nto him, but his behavior just seems odd. Tesla founder  CEO\nElon Musk sittg for a rare terview with Lesley Stahl on\nthis Sunday\'s 60 Mutes program. I want to be clear, I\ndo not respect the SEC. I do not respect them. But you\'re abidg by\nthe settlement, aren\'t you? Because I respect\nthe justice system. re are people who who say\nthat the company cannot survive without you. I don\'t thk that\'s true. Yeah. And there are people who\nsay the company cannot survive with you. Haha, that\'s hilarious. y say it because  the\nway you acted over the summer. D og thgs that\nseemed impulsive unCEOish. Well, first  all, I am somewhat\nimpulsive  I don\'t really want to try to adhere\nto some CEO template. That\'s just the character\nthat Elon is. And it\'s really difficult to sto\np him beg like that. I don\'t thk he\'s ever gog to. He\'s a divisive figure because\nhe is a divisive person. Those who are here  those who\nare watchg, thank you very much for your support over the years. It\'s been a hell  a ride. And I love you too. I love you too. l cars beg produced have the,\nhave all the hardware necessary, compute  otherwise,\nfor full selfdrivg. I feel very confident predictg\nautonomous robotaxis for Tesla next year. I just keep fdg that it\'s\na three rg circus with the guy  it\'s it\'s kd \nannoyg, but he\'s excitg. I mean he\'s P.T. Barnum, OK? You know, Barnum did\npack the seats. Yeah, but he is P.T. Barnum, P.T. Musk. Elon Musk  Tesla used\nto talk up the green angle. Now, the focus is\nshiftg to autonomous. We care about\none thg, selfdrivg. And we expect to be confident enough\nfrom our stpot to say that we thk people do not need to\ntouch the wheel, look out at the wdow, sometime probably around the\nsecond quarter  next year. When I first started at Tesla autopilot\nwas this very new concept for them. It was somethg that wasn\'t \ntheir brg when I bought my car  2012 at all. I\'ve never felt that that was\na core part  Tesla, autopilot. But it has become that now.  complete version  autopilot is\nalready  the market for sale, even though the features\nare not available. He\'s great at turng consumers\nto vestors as well. A man  Mnesota is blamg\nhis car crash on Tesla\'s autopilot feature. A Tesla sedan  autopilot\nmode crashed to a parked police cruiser yesterday  Laguna Beach,\nCalifornia, which is  Orange County. Thouss  people  the\nmaden Valley were without power tonight after a Tesla crashed\nto a power pole. re it is right\nthere, sparkg a fire. She was on automatic\npilot when it happened. Tesla\'s autopilot has been both a great\npromise, as well as a huge headache for this company. Teslas, they\'re electric vehicles. Fire departments are still figurg out how\nto put out a pure battery electric fire.  other question\nis how much Tesla\'s autopilot systems were volved \na crash potentially. This is frontier technology, people\nare tryg to underst it. So Tesla is weatherg\na lot  scruty.  other challenge with autopilot is\nthe question  whether or not drivers were fully briefed, were fully\naware  the limitations  the technology. Did drivers underst\nthat this technology could be used  certa select situations? Or did they go to this thkg, I\ncan take my hs f the wheel anywhere? It\'s better\ncruise control . A true selfdrivg car would be one\nthat I could say, go to the school, pick up the kids\n take them to writg. We don\'t even know how\nfar we are from that. I don\'t know if you know\nthat Roomba ships 2 million autonomous vacuum cleaners a year. I thk at some level, the Roomba\n the selfdrivg car are at about the same level. Another thg that\'s challengg to them\nis the build up  lawsuits. Any growg automotive company is\ngog to see this. But Tesla is dealg with a pretty\nhigh volume  lawsuits from small claims to stockholder litigation. Elon Musk scorg a legal w, all\nrelated to a tweet he posted more than a year ago. That SolarCity deal remas\ncontroversial to this day. re\'s stockholder litigation agast Tesla\nthat alleges it was a bad deal that never\nshould have happened. So the fact that he survived the\ncrash when he made eye contact for them to save them is hauntg. He built that plant  10 months. That\'s extraordary.  future \nany car company is extricably tied to the future \nthe auto dustry  .  is about 12 to 15\npercent  Tesla\'s car sales globally. And  is a very\nexcitg market for them. ir penetration  the auto, especially\n the battery EV market, is still very, very low. So I thk they can have\na long way to go. I feel a successful Gigafactory 3 \n would allow Tesla to shift much  the production for rest\n world  maybe potentially even North America, i f\nthe economics makes sense.  Chese customer loves the look\n feel  the vehicle. Elon Musk is sort  a beloved\ncharacter there,  it\'s a luxury br  a market\nthat values luxury brs. Tesla is a company with gr plans,\na gr vision, but they don\'t yet have the pro that Elon Musk\n his team can get there consistently. Look, can this company\nviably  economically make cars gog forward? We believe the\nworld\'s gog electric. We believe that they\'re showg creasgly\nthat they can make these cars pritably. That makes us feel modestly better\nabout the stock, l onger term. Tesla it was like, it was like\nlisteng to a call from a real company that made cars\n made money.  stock price literally fluences\nthe future  this company. As long as there are enough believers\n Musk can raise capital, I wouldn\'t count him out. I don\'t thk this\nis about Elon anymore. I thk this is about what\'s gog\non  the market with cars. You know, consumers are gog\ntowards premium  sustaable solutions, they\'re willg to\npay for that sustaability. Tesla hittg an all time high\nafter reportg it delivered 367,000 cars last year. Tesla today on track to open\nat a new record high. C ompany announces a program to build\nthe Model Y SUV at its Shanghai Gigafactory, deliverg its first  built\nModel 3 cars to the public,  durg that ceremony, i f\nyou haven\'t seen it by now, Musk expresses his joy by dancg\nonstage, proceedg to strip f his jacket, reveal a tshirt with\na cartoon  the factory.  stock surgg  posted its\nfirst ever backtoback net prits. Earng two dollars  1 cents\na share  the fourth quarter.  estimate  the\nstreet, a buck 72. So well above expectations there. Revenue also comg  better\nthan expected at 7.3 8 billion dollars. In six months, Tesla\nhas almost quadrupled. And dollar tradg volume yesterday was\na record for an dividual stock. I just can\'t\nbelieve this frick\' stock. It\'s sane. This is a big\nseparation from what you know, those  us like to pull out\nthe calculators   look at reality.  valuation is absurd.  balance sheet is a disaster. I don\'t thk their total addressable\nmarket is big enough for the company to capitalize on. And sooner or later, those balance\nsheet obligations are gog to come back to bite them. He changed\nthe conversation on Tesla from one about whether it can meet its obligations\n meet its goals to one , what\'s the future? Is there gog to\nbe bulletpro pickup trucks? Is it gog to be a factory\n  that\'s spittg out hundreds  thouss  cars on its way\nto millions  cars a year? That\'s a lot  expectation\n excitement for Tesla. I thk global warmg is a\nvery serious issue  it\'s somethg that we have to address,  the only\nway to address that is, is to come up with a car that\ndoesn\'t add carbon emissions to the environment. And I thk the way\nto do that is with electric vehicles. Our goal all along has been to\ntry to get the rest  the car dustry to go electric. So it\'s extremely rewardg to see that\nthe rest  the dustry is gog electric. This is great. Great. This is just the start for\nTesla,  I thk that when they really want to drum up dem for\nthese cars, they can start turng on the burners  start\nto see results pretty quickly. We saw this with\nthe Prius  California. It started f as a very\nCalifornia centric car for ecomded middle class people  has spread\nall over the world now. But the Prius is not a sexy car. It\'s not really a desirable car.  Model 3 is a sexy car. Tesla earng top marks  new\ncrash tests by the Insurance Institute Highway Safety.  Model 3, the\nfirst  Tesla\'s vehicles to w that top safety ratg. It\'s a bit\n a vdication, we should say, for the company  for Elon Musk,\nwhich,  course, was accused  makg some misleadg safety claims\nby the ional Highway Traffic Safety Admistration. Would Ford  GM  all\nthese companies be producg electric cars if Tesla hadn\'t done it\nfirst  showed them how? He\'s pushed all these legacy\ncompanies to beg to novate. That is a good thg.\nTesla could die tomorrow. y could run out  money, they\ncould close up  disappot all  their vestors tomorrow,  they\nwould still have been a force for good on the planet because\n all these legacy companies that they pushed. Musk it turns out is a\ngreat CEO when he can get out  his own way,  that seems\nto be what he\'s dog. If the Model 3 w as Tesla\'s\nbiggest turng pot to date, there\'s so much that has to go right to make\nthat car  the next batch  projects a success. Oh my god, well maybe that was a little too hard. You know, I thk there are a lot\n thgs these days that are very difficult to predict. Tesla is probably\neasier to predict,  I still have no idea whether or\nnot they\'re gog to succeed. You look back 10 years from\ntoday to 2010, we will produce approximately a thous times more cars\n 2020 than we produced  2010. A thous. So, where will we be  10 years? Very excitg to\nconsider the prospect. Today, w hen people thk  electric\ncars, they thk , well,  course it\'s faster than\nother cars, it\'s electric. And that\'s because  what we did. We changed the way the world thought\nabout electric cars as what they could be,  we restarted the\nEV revolution  the world. re were no car companies, at\nleast  any significance , makg electric cars when we\nwhen we started Tesla. And now they all are.\nEvery one  them."
32,0.0," coronavirus is crushg the\nbiggest names  U.S. air travel. In 2019 U.S. airles carried an estimated 926\nmillion passengers a 3 percent crease from 2003. But that dem hit a wall\n March 2020 after U.S. airles reported an enormous drop\n bookgs amid the spread  the\ncoronavirus outbreak. Health ficials say air travel\nis causg viruses  bacteria to spread around the\nworld faster than ever before. Air travel does hasten\nthe speed with which fectious disease spreads\naround the world. Airplanes are efficient vectors for\ngerms  bacteria  viruses to spread.  dawn  air travel\nmeant that pemics can happen, they can happen\nmuch more quickly. Airles at the center \nthe epidemic have come under tense scruty for the safety\n cleanless  their cabs. Dem is just fallg\nf  it\'s alarmg. This is the worst crisis that\nhe has ever seen  the airle dustry. Airles are\ngog to stop flyg. An airle without\nrevenues is toast. Delta Airles plans to reduce\nseat capacity by 70 percent  announced the carriers second\nquarter revenue would be $10 billion less than the\nsame period the year prior. American, United, JetBlue \nSouthwest are also parkg some  their planes, freezg\nhirg  askg employees to take unpaid time f. To combat the pemic airles\nhave imposed new safety regulations  are usg\nenhanced cleang techniques side their plane cabs. But is it enough? And how\ndo airles keep their planes clean? Airles face an uphill battle\nkeepg their planes clean. Mosquitoes carryg diseases like\nmalaria  yellow fever can sneak aboard planes. To combat bugs  other\npests the  Health Organization  the\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization have advised airles\nto use aircraft dissection, a term that refers\nto the process  sprayg an aircraft cab\nwith secticide while passengers are on board\nor after they\'ve disembarked. But it\'s primarily the job \nthe cab cleang crew to prepare your seat for\nits next flight. Cab cleaners may be side a\nplane for as little as seven mutes  as long\nas four hours. It all depends on the\nstard set by each dividual airle  the amount \ntime before the next flight. Deep cleang when every ch\n the plane is cleaned, happens overnight when an aircraft\nis parked at an airport. Though cleang stards vary\nairle to airle, most carriers follow a\nfew basic procedures. Cab cleaners today generally\nare outfitted with protective clothg  disposable\ngloves, similar to what you see here. A sgle aisle\nairplane like the Boeg 737 seats up to 230 passengers \nmight have between three to six people cleang the cab,\nplus others cleang the galleys  lavatory.  bigger Boeg 77 has more\nthan 00 seats  there could be as many as\n20 people cleang the plane. Dependg on the amount  time\nthey have before the next flight cab cleaners will pick\nup trash like used tissues  halfeaten swiches, clean\nsurfaces like tray tables, seat cushions  lavatories\nwith an antibacterial solution  even\nvacuum the carpet. Despite these efforts, some people\nare so concerned about germs that they clean\ntheir own seats. In July 2019, Naomi Campbell\'s\nYouTube page launched a video  her airport route. U.S. airles have some employees who\nclean their planes but to save money, the vast majority\n cab cleang work is outsourced to dozens \ncompanies across the U.S. In 2018, nearly twothirds \ncab cleaners worked for thirdparty companies. Airles ten award contracts\nto the lowest bidder. I mean, essentially what the\nairles have setup through contractg is they forced the\ncontractors to compete for who can provide the service \ncab cleang, as well as some  the other airle\njobs, at the lowest bid. And that means who can pay the\nworkers the least to do the work because that\'s how the\ncontractors cut their costs. re are dozens  companies\nvolved  cab cleang at the almost 500 commercial\nairports across the country. One  the biggest cab\ncleaners is ABM, a facility management firm  a public\ncompany that works with leadg U.S. airles  cleans\nmore than 1.3 million planes annually. In 2019, ABM had aviation revenue\n $1 billion, an almost 20 percent crease from 2016. Aviation revenue at ABM came\nfrom cab cleang, but also from other services like\nparkg, passenger assistance  caterg logistics. In 2015, United Airles launched\nUnited Ground Express, a subsidiary owned by the\ncarrier that provides customer service, cargo services \ncab cleang for some flights.  other top cab\ncleang companies  the U.S. are a mix  private \npublic companies that fer a range  services from\ndeicg airplanes to baggage hlg. Those companies clude DGS,\nnow known as Unifi Service, Prospect, Prime Flight,\nG2  Menzies Aviation. U.S. airles are rampg up\ntheir approach to the coronavirus outbreak, cleang their\ncabs more ten  with stronger\nhospitalgrade disfectants. Coronavirus spread rapidly around\nthe globe, killg more than 3,000 people  fectg\nmore than 870,000 as  April 1, 2020, accordg\nto Johns Hopks . Accordg to the CDC, Covid19,\nis believed to spread maly when people are  close\ncontact with each other  by respiratory droplets from an\nfected person who coughs or sneezes.  virus can survive\non a hard surface, such as plastic for up to 72 hours\n on cardboard for up to 2 hours, accordg to a\nMarch 2020 study. And accordg to the CDC,\nnew research dicates that coronavirus RNA, the genetic material\n the virus that causes Covid19, was found on\nsurfaces  the Prcess Cruise ship up to 17\ndays after passengers disembarked. Vicki Hertzberg is a biostatistician\n the lead author  a separate study on how\nfection can spread aboard an airplane. She says the odds \ncomg to contact with an fected person is relatively\nlow, but transmission creases when an fected person is\nsittg  the row  front  you, the row behd\nyou  the two seats on either side  you. What Hertzberg refers to as\nyour ""perimeter  risk."" Your probability  fection creases\nthe longer you\'re  close proximity with somebody\nwho\'s fectious  the place where that\'s gog to make\nthe most difference is if you\'re seated closely to\nthem on an airplane. To keep the air\nclean as it circulates most aircraft used by American,\nDelta  United are equipped with HEPA filters similar\nto the ones used  hospitals that provide a complete air\nchange about 15 to 30 times per hour. This isn\'t to be confused with\nthe mist you sometimes see before takef  that\'s condensation\nfog caused by the airplanes air conditioner\nbeg switched on. In response to\nthe pemic U.S. airles started usg enhanced\ncleang procedures on planes to combat the\nspread  the virus. Sce the advent  coronavirus\n Covid19 they\'ve all elevated what they do. Some airles are usg\nfoggg systems to disperse sanitizg spray throughout\nthe cab. y have elevated the tensity\n strength  the cleaners that they are usg. Take Delta. In addition to its normal\ncleang program Delta Airles is usg highgrade EPA registered\ndisfectant to wipe down common surface areas \ngalleys  lavatories.  airle has also added a\nfoggg process used  many health care facilities that pushes\nout an EPA registered disfectant on all\ntransPacific  transAtlantic bound flights. Begng April 1st, 2020, all\n Delta\'s domestic flights will undergo the same\nfoggg process overnight. And by early May every plane\n Delta\'s network will be fogged before every flight. American Airles  United Airles\nsaid they are also usg highgrade disfectants \nmultipurpose cleaners on all touch pots, cludg\nwdow shades, armrests  tray tables. Aircraft that rema\novernight at an airport receive an enhanced\ncleang procedure. United said that because \nthe coronavirus it will soon start usg an electrostatic fogger,\nwhich is essentially a pump sprayer to disfect the\nair  surfaces with the cab on all ternational\narrivals to the U.S. While viruses can live on a\nsurface for hours or days, bacteria can sometimes survive\non surfaces for months. In 201, Dimer UVC novations\nlaunched the GermFalcon, a disfectg mache for airplane\nteriors that looks like a large food \ndrk cart with wgs.  device is pushed by an\noperator  uses ultraviolet C lamps to elimate\ngerms  bacteria.  company claims it can kill\n99 percent  germs on a plane  about three mutes. UVC is proven  hospitals to\nbe effective agast all known disease causg pathogens, that\'s\nviruses, that\'s bacteria   hospitals\nits superbugs. On airplanes were primarily\nfocused on viruses like fluenza, norovirus, Ebola \nright now we\'re dealg with coronavirus. Accordg to\nKreitenberg, it can take about 30 to 5 mutes for\nthe GermFalcon to disfect a widebody plane for a narrowbody\nplane like a Boeg 737 it can take\nabout three mutes. I\'d say it\'s not\njust about coronavirus. I\'d say coronavirus is the topic\n the day but every year  America, we deal with the\nflu season  the flu season kills tens  thouss \nAmericans every sgle year. Kreitenberg said the company is\n the early stages  workg with the\nairle dustry. So far, the device has\ndisfected some flights arrivg from  at LAX Airport \nearly 2020  is now workg with Pae Field Airport \nSeattle to disfect its termals. While airles are at the center\n the coronavirus epidemic, cab cleang crews are the\nones on the front les. In March 2020, more than 600 contracted\nairport workers at Philadelphia\'s airport, cludg cab cleaners,\nwere told they were beg laid f amid\nthe coronavirus outbreak. In 2018, the most recent year\nthis data was made available there were 12,000 airle cab cleaners\n the U.S., a 10 percent crease from 2001,\naccordg to Service Employees International Union.

34,0.0,"Airbnb is one  many busesses \nthe travel dustry that has been hit hard by\nthe Coronavirus pemic. If you happen to be workg \nthe travel dustry, your entire basis  substance is gone. You can assume its occupancy rates\nhave completely fallen f a cliff. In March  2017, Airbnb was\nvalued at 31 billion dollars. By the end  April 2020,\nthe value dropped to 18 billion. At the begng  May, the company\nwas forced to lay f 25 percent  its staff, nearly\n19 hundred dividuals. CEO Brian Chesky told employees that\nrevenue this year was forecasted to be less than half \nwhat the company earned  2019. y need people to be bookg or,\nyou know, they could be  trouble.  company was founded \n2008 by three friends from college, startg with their own\napartment as the first listg.  concept was simple. Airbnb has hosts  guests.  hosts list their properties on\nAirbnb, the guests book those properties on Airbnb  Airbnb takes\na cut from both sides. y take a percentage  every bookg,\nwhich is very similar to how Uber, how Lyft make money.  company grew quickly  today\nhas over seven million listgs worldwide. In January 2020, Airbnb saw\n50.2 million Web site visits. Airbnb competition, VRBO saw 1.7 million\nvisits  the same month. Today, Airbnb, by the number  rooms\nthat it has or the number  nights that it books is by\nfar the largest operator  the hospitality dustry. No hotel company can\ncompete with the scale. But the global pemic is provg\nto be Airbnb's greatest challenge yet.  company is strugglg\nwith cancellations  reimbursements after Airbnb announced it would\nbe refundg customers whose reservations fell with\na certa timeframe. This angered many hosts who were stuck\nhavg to pay back most, if not all,  the cost  the rental. No one knows what to\ndo  this situation. Many guests were also angered by\nthe way Airbnb hled refund requests. I might just be screwed. Which is completely unfair,  that's\na lot  money, man. That's a that's a lot  money. And while social distancg measures\nwere  place, some local governments deemed short term\nrentals as nonessential busesses, addg more stress to hosts who\nrely on Airbnb for come. Airbnb hosts, if they're gog to\ntry  have their busess, they're actually gonna be skirtg the law. It was speculated that Airbnb would go\npublic  2020, but that goal is growg more  more distant. Certaly it would be very\ndifficult  this environment. With the threat  more cancellations\nas the pemic cripples the travel dustry, guests, hosts \nvestors like are left askg what Airbnb will look like after\nthe Coronavirus pemic or whether the company will survive at all. Airbnb be defed an entire subgenre\n the travel dustry as it gaed popularity, the\nshort term rental It's like Kleenex, you know. Kleenex  Kleenex, it's tissue\n Airbnbs aren't Airbnbs, they're short term rentals. Airbnb doesn't have a viable competitor,\nat least  the United States   many other markets. Though it quickly became a market\nleader, it does not have an untarnished record.  platform has been criticized for\ndrivg up rent prices  contributg to housg shortages\n major cities. It has also been criticized\nfor racial discrimation, illegal listgs, hosts usg spy cams,\ntroublesome, sometimes deadly house parties  unnecessary fees. Despite these conflicts, Airbnb\nwas dog well. Accordg to source says Airbnb actually\nwas pritable  2017  2018. And that's actually seen as a\nlittle bit rare for a unicorn  its size that has this\nmarketplace  the gig economy. In 2019, however, Airbnb burned through\nmore money  is thought to have notched losses.  company was aimg to\ngo public  2020. We thk next year will be\nthe right time for us. Ok. y have very\nstrong market position. ir busess was gog well. Reservations were gog up. Everythg was potg \nthe right direction. And then  course the sky fell. As Covid19, spread across the globe,\ntravel ceased  Airbnb lost nearly 2 percent  its value from\nMarch  2017 to April  2020. You have to ask, did Airbnb\nwait too long to go public? Many people would say that it did. On March 1th, 2020, Airbnb\nannounced an extenuatg circumstances policy that suspended the cancellation\npolicy set by Airbnb hosts. If a guest book to trip on\nor before March 1th with check dates between March 1th  April 1th,\nthat guest was allowed to cancel eligible trips without penalty.  policy was extended to allow\nguests with reservations up until May 31st  then aga to June\n15th to be eligible for either an Airbnb credit or the more selective\noption, a full cash refund. In any two sided market, you always\nfigured out who you're gog to subsidize more  what you're\ngog to actually screw more. This was a blow for hosts, some\n whom would lose thouss from the new policy. Cancellations are a detriment\nto the host's bottom le. That's why on Airbnb platform,\nthe hosts choose the cancellation policy they are comfortable with. y made a policy change\nthat overrode every sgle partners cancellation policies. y made the decision to give guests\nwho fit a specific wdow, a 100 percent refund, regardless  whether,\nyou know, you as a host had chosen strict,\nmoderate or flexible. This change puts hosts\n difficult situations. Liam  Travers are two hosts that\nmake a livg from their Airbnb listgs. I mean, I lost thouss\nupon thouss with like a week. My phone just kept gog f. Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel. cancel. I was lookg at a\nbusess that did almost two million dollars  revenue last year \nwith two days, I'm like, everythg is good. n all  a\nsudden I'm thkg I might have to go bankrupt. Many hosts rely on\nthe money they make on Airbnb, whether it's just rentg out a spare\nroom or if they've built a busess with hundreds\n properties. It's what pays for my mortgage\n property taxes,   San Francisco, those two\nthgs are lot. Some hosts have shifted their\nbusess model to compensate. re's multiple ways that\nI can hle this. I can either sit back  blame\nAirbnb for the whole situation or I could kd  take action to my\nown hs  try to pivot my busess model so that I can\nmake it through these challengg times, which luckily I did. Travers created a guide for other\nAirbnb hosts discussg ways to save their busesses durg this global\npemic,  Travers, along with many hosts, have turned to longer\nrentals, especially for those  the health care dustry to make up\nfor the loss  short term vacation rentals,  Airbnb\nhas supported the strategy. Right now, durg Covid, I opened it\nup to a health care worker. A frontle worker\nwas stayg there. But Airbnb decision to favor guests\nover hosts has tated some relationships. y had options. y could have put their listgs\non Airbnb, be on VRBO, on Bookg.com, built their own websites,\nput them on Craigslist. You know, they had options, but they\nwere gog nice  steady  exclusive with Airbnb. And that decision on March 1th just\ncompletely broke the trust for a lot  these hosts.  relationship\nwith Airbnb, it was it was great. I mean, the customers just\nkept on comg, especially  Pittsburgh, where the market's\nnot too saturated. And then with the coronavirus now,\nit's just a new challenge.  CEO, Brian Chesky, faced\nbacklash over the extenuatg circumstances policy. Brian Chesky is seen as an\nnovator, but also somewhat  an operator. He will be  challenged\nover the next year to navigate Airbnb way through this crisis. He later apologized for makg\nthat decision without the host community. I wanted to say\nthis to you right now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry we\ndidn't consult you as partners. And I've heard for you\never sce that decision. And what I've heard is that, you know,\nyou want us to treat you  like partners. People\nmake mistakes. He made a mistake. But that doesn't\nmean he isn't on the leadership team, isn't the right team to\nguide Airbnb past this crisis. In response, the company created a\n250 million dollar fund for strugglg hosts, but there was some\nfe prt on how much hosts would be helped,  many hosts\nwere still left strugglg with the cost  cancellations. Airbnb said that, you know, with our\nnew policy, you're gog to get 25 percent  what\nyou should have had. So that sounds that you're gog to\nget 25 percent  your bookg. But really, it's 25 percent  the\n50 percent that you would have had. So a lot  the hosts\nare dog the math,  really, that's just twelve pot five percent\n the origal bookg. What has happened with the guest,\nhowever, doesn't quite add up either. Though some guests had an\neasy time gettg their refunds. Other guests were asked\nto jump through hoops. Eduardo bani was flyg to Rome\nwhere his parents live,  the three  them are gog to\nfly to Barcelona after that. When he asked to cancel,\nAirbnb customer service suggested bani have his elderly parents \nItaly get a doctor's note. What they would recommend to you is\nthat you send your parents to the doctor, get a certificate\nthey can't travel. I said excuse me. I mean, my parents\nare pretty old, there is a global pemic. I mean, it's not safe. It's not somethg you can\nask  this phase. re are I mean, there over 70\nyear old, they're really high risk people. Airbnb Customer Service also\nasked for sensitive formation from this guest who\nasked to rema anonymous. My wife, who is a nurse \na major hospital  Charlotte, used the reason  a medical worker. And then they came back  said,\nwell, if you're a medical worker, we need documentation from your supervisor\n the hospital sayg that you're unable to travel these days\ndue to Covid19  your work obligations. That's not what\nthe CEO said.  CEO said it was\nunequivocal, we're givg refund. Done.  hospital had better thgs\nto do than spend their time writg letters justifyg why an\nemployee can't do convenience travel. And we refused to ask\nher employer for that formation. Our plan was to do a trip\nto Sayulita, Mexico for sprg break with our kids  then another family. You're gonna give a refund to people\nwho had scheduled to go between March 1th  May 31st. I was scheduled between March\n15th  March 22nd. Clearly with there. And yet\nI'm not gettg a refund. l  these folks were\ntravelg with the extenuatg circumstances, policy timeframe. Luckily, bani  the anonymous\nguest eventually received refunds. But Scanlon is out eight thous\neight hundred nety six dollars because he asked his host to cancel\non March 12th  the policy didn't go to effect\nuntil March 1th. Accordg to Airbnb's extenuatg\ncircumstances policy, cancellations will be hled accordg to\nthe extenuatg circumstances coverage  effect at the time \nsubmission  reservations that were already canceled will\nnot be reconsidered. I have no recourse here. I don't know what to do. My experience  what the requirement was\nto get a full refund was very different than what the CEO\nsaid, his written message, the corporate website. Given the service I've received, I don't\nknow if I will choose it aga. Airbnb responded to these\nthree guests complats, sayg our global customer service team has been\nworkg around the clock to help both hosts  guests throughout\na situation that has been challengg for the\nentire dustry. We firmly believe that travelers should\nnot have to choose between safety  money  are\nextenuatg circumstances policy aims to strike a balance  protect the\nwellbeg  both hosts  guests. Beyond these three guests, the outcry\nhas been loud agast Airbnb's customer service. People are congregatg on Twitter. y're congregatg on Facebook. y're congregatg on Reddit\nto compla about this. I have now like an Airbnb\ncustomers or agent because they're havg no luck with the company, \nnow they're turng to reporters because that's the only\nthg they can do. l this adds up to a pretty\nunstable future for Airbnb, at least for the immediate future. What a day for Airbnb to get\nthrough this is, first  all rega trust  the hosts as\nwell as the guests. I thk, you know, one  the worst\nthgs that you can deal with is uncertaty. And that's certaly what's\ngog on right now. I can't image that the company\nwill go public  2020. In early April 2020, Airbnb be\nraised one billion dollars  fundg from vestors Silverlake \nSixth  Partners. But that wasn't enough.  company raised another one billion\ndollars  debt from Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Apollo \nOaktree just a week later. It is gettg hit hard by the global\npemic  it needs to put more cash on its balance sheet  case\nthis goes on for longer  longer. So it did go to the market twice,\nbut when you look at the types  vestors that have gotten to Airbnb,\nthat is a vote  confidence that some  the biggest hedge\nfunds, private equity funds  stitutional vestors \nthe world. It's not a bad opportunity for an vestor\nto come   buy up A irbnb's shares  the private market\nfor the cheap, because  the long run, I thk it's a solid\ncompany with a solid busess model, but they need more capital. I don't thk, you know, two billion\ndollars is gonna go too far, by the way. But that still wasn't enough\nmoney  Airbnb had to make massive cuts to its workforce. Airbnb has also enacted a hirg\nfreeze, cut executive salaries by 50 percent  may\nscrap employee bonuses.  CEO won't even get a\nsalary for the next six months. In better news for the company, some\nsay Airbnb is  a better position than other busesses \nthe travel dustry, especially hotels. Because a hotel company\nstill has to pay rent. y still have to pay\nthe real estate taxes. y still have to pay the labor. y have to keep the\nfacilities mataed  cleaned. While it's unlikely the company will\nclose its doors for good once this is all over, it may end\nup beg a very different company when folks do start travelg aga. I do believe they will come\nthrough this actually much more strongly than the hospitality\ndustry  general. Probably Airbnb doesn't know if they're\ngonna get through this because we don't know how long this pemic\nis gog to last  we don't know how long it's gog to\ntake before people feel comfortable to travel aga  stay  other people's\nhomes or even book a hotel room.  type  fall that we might\nsee can be more  le with that  Uber  we work. re is still around, but there are\nshell  what they once were."
35,0.0," Covid 19 outbreak has straed global\nairles to the brk,   the United States, major carriers are scramblg\nto react to the unfoldg pemic. We've seen a dramatic drop\n dem that really the dustry hasn't seen sce 9/11.  next few months will be ugly for\nthe travel dustry  terms  both dem  their\nfancial performance.  itial coronavirus outbreak caused a\nmassive drop  air travel side   between\nJanuary  February. As the virus has spread, both\nvacationers  busess travelers have curb ed their plans. And on March\n11th, 2020, President Trump announced that travel from parts \nEurope to the U.S. would be halted for 30 days, which\nlater exped to clude Irel  the . Airles around the world scrambled\nto fd a way to survive without passengers. re have been discussions about whether\nto tell people not to fly. It's the worst crisis to hit the\nair travel dustry sce the 9/11 terror attacks. Delta Airles has cut\nits capacity by 70 percent. United Airles has cut 65 percent\n its capacity  American Airles has cut 50 percent  its capacity. When an airle says they're gog\nto cut capacity, that means they're gog to cancel some flights. And that could be cancelg frequencies \na route that has lots  frequencies  it. Or it could\nmean stoppg flyg between two cities they've been flyg before. Airles talk about capacity as the number\n seats they have  the air at any time or really the number \nseats they have out for sale at any time. Internationally Norwegian, SAS \nLufthansa have suspended most  their operations  more cutbacks\nare expected from other airles. That dem picture is\nworse than after 9/11. And we have no visibility as to\nwhen thgs are gog to recover. On the range  possibility, sure, there\nis a scenario where a couple  months from now, maybe coronavirus isn't\neradicated, but thgs are more stable  health authorities are changg\ntheir advice that people are willg to get back on airplanes. But you know that at this pot\nis the most optimistic estimate scenario, months  disruption.  U.S. Senate just reached a deal\non a massive two trillion dollar relief package to help with dustries \ndividuals hit by the coronavirus pemic.  airles wanted $50 billion\nfrom the package,  the exact details on what ended up\n the deal remaed vague. What we do know now, is that airles\nwon't be able to buy back stock or hout bonuses to CEOs as part  the\ndeal,  they won't need to pay back the direct cash\ngrants they receive. Though the government will\ntake an equity share.  airles must also agree to refra\nfrom layfs until later  2020. Airles run on tough margs  regional\nstart ups go under every year. It is easy to see why\nthe Covid 19 outbreak concerns airles. In 2019 alone, twenty three airles\nclosed shop, cludg WoW Airles  Thomas Cook. And that's\nbefore the coronavirus pemic. And  2020, aska Airles said it\nhas seen two hundred sixty five thous fewer bookgs for\nMarch than  2019.  impact airle travel \n was rapid  vast. Flights dropped by more than 80\npercent, accordg to the Civil Aviation Admistration  .  onset\n quarantes side  startg  move on grounded\nhundreds  airlers. In 2016, 20 million travelers\nuse the Wuhan International Airport. And Beijg, where an eleven pot four\nbillion dollar state  the art airport was just opened, ranks as the\nsecond busiest city for air travel  the world. Even  areas\nnot quaranted by the Chese government. Citizens were reluctant to travel. Disease spreads when people are stuck\n close proximity to each other, somethg airles are famous for. As the Covid 19 outbreak spread\n the United States, planes began travelg with near empty cabs\nas passengers canceled their flights. People were told to limit their\nactivities  embrace social distancg. That's not so easy at 30000 feet. Admistration ficials even recommended that\nthose at the highest risk, such as the elderly or those with\nunderlyg health problems, not fly at all. l those flights beg grounded has\na ripple effect on the dustry.  challenge for everybody is nobody knows\nwhen this virus is gog to be addressed, when it will start to\nabate, when people will feel more confident about flyg,  importantly,\nwhen busess travelers will return to the skies. This isn't the first major disruption\nthe airle dustry has faced after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Aircraft were grounded throughout the United\nStates  no flights were allowed  or out  the country. Besides the immediate concern over\nstred passengers, airles took a massive fancial hit. It took a $15 billion bailout from\nCongress to keep major airles afloat. Another recent disaster for the airle\ndustry was the eruption  the Isl Mounta Glacier volcano \nIcel when the volcano erupted. A massive plume  ash was released\nto the atmosphere, makg the most efficient air routes between\nEurope  America unusable.  cident cascaded  slowed down\nglobal routes as aircraft  passengers were stred or redirected\nto much longer routes.  2008 recession also caused a slowdown\n air travel, one  the dustry's most lucrative clientele, busess\ntravelers dropped to all time lows. Durg 2008, the U.S. airle dustry lost just more\nthan five billion dollars. To put it to context, after 9/11, \n2002, the dustry had a big, lost one  a half percent. In other words, air travel was\ndown one  a half percent. That was pretty tough.  Great Recession. We\nlost about 1 percent. This year, we could lose 10. Airles are more than just a way to get\nfrom pot A to pot B, they are a pot  national pride. In previous economic slowdowns, governments\naround the world have stepped  to prevent national\ncarriers from gog under.  last time the government\nrescued airles followg 9/11, the government actually made\nmoney on that. It basically got to get a stake \nthese airles  sold its stake years later at about a 300 million dollar\nprit similar to the auto maker bailout. Besides gettg bailouts \neconomic stimulus, airles also take their own actions\nto survive sudden downturns. y cut routes such as daily shuttle\nflights between cities  also long haul flights with\nhigh overhead costs. When you're  trouble, the first order\n busess is fly the airplane. Make sure you know how much fuel you\nhave, where you are, where are you gog, that your wgs\nare straight  level. And that's kd  where\nthe dustry is right now. Okay. Where are we? What do we need to do? And what\nthat means is they need to preserve cash, as much cash as they can, which\nmeans they're cancelg flights that would likely lose cash, but contug to\nfly flights that are generatg cash. Some airles have already grounded large\nportions  their aircraft  laid f staff  hopes \nresumg operations after the pemic has subsided. Airports  all the workers who\nmake the day to day operations runs will also be\naffected by the slowdown. And aircraft manufacturers like Boeg\nare lookg for federal help. Boeg was fortunate to be able to\nget through one major crisis that might have killed a lot  other customers. That,  course, the groundg\n the Boeg max. Who's too big to fail?  cidates for that, a wider swath\n the economy than it would have previously been. But the arguments Boeg\nwould make is, look, Boeg is America's biggest exporter. re's no other company that exports more\nto the world than Boeg does. It employs,  course,\na lot  people. And yeah, it's a producer  goods\nthat are key to national security. No question about that. Aga, a lot  other\npeople certaly be  le. A lot  other people,\nCompanies, for government aid.  potential bailout is already facg\nsome serious push back from lawmakers. United Airles just announcg that\nthey will lose money  the first quarter, not make money. And Boeg is suspendg its operations,\nproduction operations up  the Puget Sound area. In normal prepemic\ntimes, Boeg might have been a sure thg for a government bailout,\nbut there are several other dustries  sectors lg up for\ngovernment assistance because  the coronavirus.  fancial outlook for\nairles just took a nosedive. And while the pemic ranks as\nthe biggest disruption  aviation history, it perhaps hit at\nan advantageous time for carriers. 9/11 happened on a Tuesday. By that Saturday. U.S. airles were layg f tens\n thouss employees  employees over contental labor. Part  United, what, first, 12000\nlayfs, 20 percent  its workforce. And with a few weeks, 75000 U.S. airle jobs were gone this time. Weeks to the crisis, U.S. airles, the major ones, anyway, still\nhadn't laid f their their first person. Even though the capacity cuts this\ntime have been far greater, the golden age  air travel has\nleft airles with full cfers, especially American based companies.  liquid assets  the major airles\n most  the regional players are  good shape. And unlike\nafter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there probably won't be a need for\nmassive reorganizations  the major airles. I don't thk  it\nexactly like 9/11, however, because after 9/11, the dustry was forced to\nrestructure  some really dramatic ways. Several airles went\nto bankruptcy protection. Airles closed hubs that didn't\nmake much sense after 9/11. re were big changes for\ncustomers  terms  security. And on the airplane, the door to\nthe cockpit  the procedures on the airplane. I don't see those kds \nchanges comg with this, at least not yet. Mechanics, suppliers  pilots\nfor the most part aren't gettg laid f  mass as  yet. And those that are hopefully\nonly beg laid f temporarily. It is expected that there will be\na need for them shortly after the pemic subsides.  problem with the pemic is that\nno one really knows how long this could go on. For U.S. airles, look if you could assure\nthem that this is gog to be a two or a three month issue, I don't\neven know that they would be wantg government aid  takg some \nthe strgs attached to that. Most  these U.S. airles would be\npositioned to get through a months long disruption.  problem is they just\ndon't know how long it's gog to go on  to keep employg\npeople, payg people basically to stay home defitely. y would quickly run out  money. That's a key difference between\nthis crisis  9/11. Airles are well positioned  the\nshort term compared to previous downturns. However, the requests for\nstimulus from the government dicates the dustry is worried about\nhow long this will last. Airles thought they were\nprepared for anythg. And it turns out they were\nprepared for anythg except this."

37,0.0,"If you\'re one  the four billion people who flew last year chances are you flew on either an Airbus or Boeg aircraft.  AirbusBoeg duopoly domates the already under competitive aircraft manufacturg dustry by producg more than 99%  its large airplane orders globally. It\'s become one  the most efficient duopolies ever  the history  manufacturg Are smaller competitors fally givg them a run for their money? Or are they just gettg scooped up? Will  step to the market  make waves? What about the future  flyg? Will Supersonic planes challenge Airbus  Boeg\'s domance? Before we answer those questions let\'s start with how we got to a place where just two companies own the air Boeg has always been a big player  the aviation field for over 100 years.  Boeg Company was created  1916. William Boeg founded the Aero Products Company  developed a sgle enge seaplane  the busess was renamed the Boeg Company  sold its planes to the Navy durg the First  War Boeg contued to sell its aircraft durg the 1920s  1930s to the U.S. military. Durg this time Boeg also exped to airmail services. In 1919 Eddie Hubbard  I took a flight up to Vancouver B.C. This was the first ever ternational mail ever carried by planes to the United States.  Boeg Airplane  Transportation Corporation was formed  it covered both the manufacturg  airle operations but the Air Mail Act  193 split aircraft manufacturers from air transport. So the conglomerate  the day was dissolved  the company went back to beg called ""Boeg."" With the development  turbo jets, the Boeg 707 was troduced to the public  1958 on Pan American\'s trans Atlantic route  the public loved it With smoother rides  a shorter flight time Boeg paved the way for the future  commercial flight. Boeg may encapsulate Americana via the golden age  flyg but the much younger Airbus had a rough road to success. It started as a group effort  Europe to take on American manufacturers. In 1967 Germany, France,  Brita came to the agreement that a cooperation  aviation field would promote technology  economic growth  Europe. y drew up plans for a short haul European Airbus that would accommodate the public\'s desire to fly more for less. Plans were made to construct the A300. In October  1972 the A300 completed its first flight. But Airbus leaders had an uphill battle ahead  them convcg the world they created the most novative aircraft. By 198 Airbus received 11 orders  had 282 aircraft  active service.  persistence paid f the long run because  2018 Airbus delivered 800 planes. 11% growth from the year before. And Boeg\'s busess is thrivg as well. In 2018 the company set the record for the most airplane deliveries with 806 commercial jets, 5.6% growth from 2017. And the stocks have reflected the company\'s domance. Both Airbus  Boeg stocks have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. How can you tell these planes apart? Boeg  Airbus have subtle differences. For stance the cockpit  a Boeg 737 has a yoke control whereas an Airbus A320 does not. That\'s just one  the many ways these companies diverge  their manufacturg. Most are only felt by the crew  travelers with a keen eye. How do airles decide which company to buy from?   it like gog to a car dealership  choosg between a Chevy  a Ford. Both are supposed to get you to your destation but which one has a better deal? And what does the existg fleet look like? For example, Spirit  Frontier operate only Airbus, while Southwest is an all Boeg fleet. It\'s hard for low cost operations like these to switch.  legacy airles usually have a mix  both. So what does it take for companies like Airbus  Boeg to control the airle dustry? Well, buildg these airplanes isn\'t cheap. To be a real competitor aviation companies must have the money to spend.  barriers to entry  this busess are huge  terms  capital requirements,  terms  technology experience, customer support, customer fance, all  these thgs. A sgle plane can run up millions  dollars  construction fees. Boeg is currently workg on a new series  airplanes called the 777X. A sgle 7779 has a list price  $388.7 million dollars. That\'s because there are hundreds  thouss  components to an airplane. A Boeg 77 alone is made up  six million parts. But materials aren\'t the only thg that costs aviation companies big. Safety comes with a hefty price tag. It\'s defitely a wellregulated dustry. I don\'t thk there\'s any question about that. I actually view much, not all, but I view much  that regulation has a historical partnership that has actually served the dustry quite well. If you consider that the airles today aviation globally carries three billion passengers a year  most years kill fewer than 500  them. Some years none. That\'s a pretty extraordary record. And reachg that level  safety requires a great expense And these massive companies have plenty  money And at least for Boeg a lot  it comes from the government. It was the second largest government contractor  2017 behd only Lockheed Mart brgg  more than 23 billion dollars. It also spends big to keep its close relationship with Washgton.  company spent more on lobbyg than any other company  the United States other than General Electric from 1998 to 2018 accordg to Open Secrets 270 million dollars.  actg Secretary  Defense at the begng  2019 is a former Boeg executive that led the 787 Dreamler program. And the actg admistrator  the Federal Aviation Admistration or the FAA used to work for an airle manufacturg dustry group Respondg to a question about its lobbyg power. Boeg told  this ""as the nation\'s largest exporter  a leadg producer  both commercial  defense aerospace products, there are a number  significant policy issues at the federal state  local levels with the potential to impact our busess our diverse workforce  our supply cha. Our team is focused on tellg Boeg""s story  supportg policies that advance the aviation dustry  U.S. manufacturg  the communities where we live  work.""  company\'s entrenched position has a real world impact. When Delta ordered planes from the Canadian company Bombardier  2016, the company fought hard argug the smaller competitor could only sell them at such a low price to the Canadian subsidies.  Trump admistration origally sided with Boeg puttg tariffs on the planes but Boeg ended up losg the battle when the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled  Bombardier\'s is favor at the begng  2018.  battle showed how hard it has become for smaller companies to break to the market. Which brgs us exactly to that where is the competition? Airbus  Boeg may comm domestic  ternational airspace but for regional flights the Canadian company Bombardier  the Brazilian company Embraer control the market or at least they used to.  overhead for the aviation manufacturg busess can be crushg  regional aircraft manufacturers like Bombardier a couldn\'t shoulder the costs. Bombardier  Canada had the  best hope  gettg  they simply ran out  cash. And this year their jetler was basically absorbed by Airbus. Now the Airbus A220 rather than the Bombardier CSeries. In 2017 Airbus announced it would acquire a majority stake  Bombardier\'s CSeries. Airbus rebred the series as a new a 220  sold 120 former CSeries jets to U.S. airle companies  2018. Airbus will beg buildg the aircraft later this month. And let\'s not forget about Brazilian aircraft company Embraer the other regional jet manufacturer. Boeg just bought 80%  Embraer commercial aviation busess for a whoppg $.2 billion dollars.  Brazilian government approved the deal  January  both companies announced that they expect to get all the remag approvals before 2020.  reality was that these smaller companies weren\'t really competg anyway. In 2016 regional aircraft deliveries were less than 7%  the airplane market by value. Other countries like Russia   have also been tryg to become proment players  the aircraft manufacturg dustry. But so far both countries have been unable to make a dent  the private sector. y could flip a switch  they\'d be great at it.  frustratg thg about  is that the only possible thg they could do wrong is exactly what they\'re dog. y\'ve got the biggest market  the world. y\'ve got limited talent on limited resources. y should be great  this. But the strategy they\'re pursug is basically diggg a giant hole. y\'re runng it as a government operation  very simply government owned dustries to not do a good job beatg commercial market needs. Next thg they\'re dog is rather than sayg to their engeers, ""hey you can go shoppg for the best components  technology around the globe..."" y\'re sayg you have to buy stuff made    that means only stuff that volves Western companies comg to   surrenderg their tellectual property. Boeg  Airbus aren\'t shyg away from potential competition. Boeg highlighted its partnership with COMAC on a completion  a facility  Zhoushan.  company also told us, ""\'s commercial aviation sector represents a major customer an important partner  a potent competitor.  is on track to become the largest commercial airplane market  the world over the next few years. Gettg the right balance between collaboratg  competg requires work  constant evaluation."" When we asked Airbus about Chese competition they told  this ""the Boeg Airbus to Oxley isn\'t likely to last forever. In general we see  as the next major competitor though  some 10 to 20 years from now.  Chese market is large enough for more than two competitors  every market we welcome competition. Airbus was born competition, thrives  it,  believes it is good for the development  our dustry. So what\'s next for the aviation dustry? Will it be the return  supersonic travel?  aptly named Coloradobased company Boom Supersonic announced it has received millions  fundg from vestors. Boom is lookg to make supersonic travel mastream. Marketg their aircraft is beg able to get passengers to  from their destations two times faster than busess class flights today. Commercial supersonic travel isn\'t new. In 1976 the first Concorde flights took f from London  just outside Paris. But the Concorde days were short lived. Noise pollution, mountg expenses, combed with a fatal air crash caused the Concorde to be retired  2003. But there are many barriers sittg  the way  creatg supersonic commercial travel.  first beg it\'s illegal. y would have to demonstrate that these are usable over l. At present it\'s not legal to operate supersonically over lmasses at least  the U.S.  been testg so called ""quiet boom"" aircraft  fact they\'re testg them right now  the Gulf  Mexico, the people  Galveston Texas are the dummies I guess to see whether they notice the booms. It remas to be seen whether those theoretical designs can be put to practice. But the big question is can supersonic travel be economically feasible? Will they be willg to pay five times as much for the aircraft  their operatg costs  order to go twice as fast because the fuel bill basically piles up. We\'re now flyg slower than we did  1970s  80s but on the other h there\'s this economic reason for that. It\'s not just civilian companies developg supersonic travel. Lockheed Mart announced plans to build supersonic aircraft that could change commercial travel. Lockheed Mart is partnerg with  to develop the X59 QueSST. This aircraft is designed to have a cruisg altitude  55,000 feet  a termal speed  90 miles per hour. And forget that super alarmg sonic boom. Accordg to the Lockheed Mart Skunkworks team the plane would create a sound no louder than the slammg  a car door. But the development is still  its beta stages. As for Boeg  Airbus both companies told us supersonic  hypersonic travel is on their radars  that they are committed to pursug multiple novative technologies movg forward.  future  the aviation manufacturg busess remas unclear. But one thg is clear the multibillion dollar dustry will contue to grow as millions  more people around the world enter the middle class.  International Air Transport Association expects the number  air travelers to double to 8.2 billion by 2037  Airbus  Boeg are poised to take a vantage  those soarg trends."
38,0.0," Coronavirus outbreak has crippled\nthe world's economy as people attempt to slow down the\nspread  the disease. What makes the pemic particularly frighteng\nfor many is the lack  an approved vacce or\ntreatment  the virus. So there is no\napproved therapy for COVID19. So physicians  the hospital\nare generally treatg symptoms, providg supportive care. That fluids  oxygen \nrenal replacement therapy is needed. Really tryg to keep the patient alive\nso the patient has a chance to recover on their own. One glimmer\n hope could be the recent discovery  a\npossible treatment Remdesivir. Manufactured by Gilead sciences. Data shows that Remdesivir, has\nit clear cut significant positive effect  dimishg the\ntime to recovery. Developg a treatment for COVID19 is\nimportant to help patients that are critically ill who need either\nsome sort  reduction  side effects, prevent viral entry to the\ncells, or  other words, you know, prevent the\ndisease from progressg. Knowg how to treat COVID19 could be\na valuable asset  a turng pot  the fight\nagast the pemic. So how close are we\nto developg a treatment? And why would economic\nrecovery depend on it? re are several ways to fight a\npemic, but a vacce that can help build up immunity agast COVID19\nstill remas the long term solution.  vacce is\nreally the holy grail. It's the thg that really opens\nup the possibilities  returng to a normal way  life.  problem is it's gog to take\nsome time to be approved for mass use, about 12 to 18\nmonths, accordg to most experts. Yet some reports predict that close\nto half  the global population will eventually contract the virus\nwhile aggressive testg to conta the spread  the disease\nstill remas a top priority, s cientists  researchers believe that\nan effective treatment can serve as a bridge to a vacce\nthat will hopefully arrive  the near future. Developg a treatment for\nCOVID disease is important because we know that without treatment,\nthere's a high morbidity  mortality rate. Governments  dustries\nacross the world are combg their efforts \ndevelopg a treatment. U.S. health agencies like the\nional Institutes  Health have partnered up with a dozen\nleadg pharmaceutical companies for a faster collaboration, while more than\n70 countries have joed the WHO to accelerate\nthe research process. though President Trump\ncontroversially suspended American contributions to the organization. y're poolg all  the data that\nwe have about the safety  efficacy  treatments  makg\nthat available to companies to speed development even faster\nthan its normal. re are hundreds  treatment\noptions currently under consideration. On March 2th, the FDA approved\nthe use  convalescent plasma therapy that uses the blood \nrecovered patients to treat those  critical condition.  Mayo Clic is\ncurrently the leadg site for evaluatg the efficacy\n the therapy. re's been a lot  news coverage\nabout the plasma therapy,  I thk it's because it\nshould be widely accessible. It's cheap. And the trials\nare ongog right now. It's a treatment that's actually been\naround for over 100 years to combat other diseases like the\nSpanish flu pemic  1918. So the theory underlyg treatg\nsomebody with COVID disease with plasma is that a patient who\nhas previously recovered COVID should have antibodies  those antibodies\nshould target the virus  hopefully will neutralize that virus\nso that the virus stops replicatg. If proven to be effective,\nplasma therapies can also be used to protect healthcare workers who\nare treatg patients on the frontles. Further testg is still needed\nto prove its efficacy  safety before it can be\nroutely admistered to patients. Right now, we don't know how\neffective it's gog to be. And so it's important to do\nthese treatments under control study circumstances so that we can study,\ndo patients who have recovered from the virus have antibodies? Do they neutralize? And do they help make\npeople better as a consequence. If proved, the challenge also lies\n securg enough plasma to treat those who are  need, a constrat\nmade even more difficult by FDA's restriction on donations from\ngay  bisexual men.  biggest challenge right now\nis identifyg donors  havg donors work through the system  a\nmanner that allows them to donate plasma efficiently.  systems are beg developed as\na new treatment where we're a therapy or so,  so\nthere's been some growg pas. But there is now a national\neffort to coordate the blood donation activities. Convalescent plasma therapy is\njust one  many therapeutic treatments currently\nunder consideration. As  April 19th, the FDA\nrevealed that there are 72 treatments currently gog under trial, with\nan additional 211 alternative treatments  their\nplanng stages. Yes, there's a lot  therapies\n what dividual stitutions are dog  Mayo is one \nthem, is evaluatg those therapies. Which ones can we access? Which ones do we thk have\nthe most favorable benefit to to potential side effect ratio  tryg\nto decide which trials we want to start here. Another possible\ntreatment option that regulators are heavily leang towards is\nrepurposg existg medications. It is very common to use\nrecycled drugs to treat new diseases. In many cases, we don't have effective\ntherapy, so we use what we have. Repurposed medications have two\nunique advantages over workg on a treatment from\nscratch, time  supply. y're already available  approved for\na different disease  most markets  the world. So  a\nperfect world, the fastest way for us to get a treatment is to use\nan existg drug  fd out through clical trials that it works\n COVID19 as well. Drugs that are normally used to\ntreat other conditions like HIV, malaria, Ebola  rheumatoid arthritis\nare currently under trial as possible cidates to\ntreat COVID19. Kevzara a rheumatoid arthritis drug made\nby Regeneron  Sani show promisg results for the\nsickest  coronavirus patients.  immune response that you see\n rheumatoid arthritis may be very similar to the immune response\nthat you see  COVID19. So you're tryg to apply the\nsame concept to a different disease. re's still an immune response. Immune response is our\nimmune responses with body. And so you're tryg to affect\nthat immune response with a similar mechanism. Even if they are proven safe\nfor human consumption, repurposed drugs must still go through rigorous\nadditional trials to ensure their safety  efficacy\nagast COVID19. It takes a lot  trial  error\n many cases to come up with the either treatment or preventive vacce that\nis gog to be used  the public. And a lot  these\nreally hge on not only is it effective, but is it safe? You can give somethg to a patient\nthat will stop or treat the disease or prevent it from\ngog to another person. However, it could be at such a high\nlevel that it is toxic to that patient. Hydroxychloroque is a recent\nexample  the importance  rigorous clical trials.  antimalaria drug is available \na generic form,  is also produced under the br name\nPlaquenil by French pharmaceutical company Sani.  malaria drug was once touted by\nPresident Trump as a game changer  the fight agast COVID19 After\nshowg promisg results  a small scale study  France. I thk it could be a game\nchanger  maybe not  maybe not. But I thk it could be based on\nwhat I see, it could be a game changer. However, a recent nationwide\nstudy revealed it might result  more deaths without any\nreal benefits, promptg the ional Institutes  Health as well as the\nFDA to warn agast its use due to the risk regardg its toxicity. re is a lot  confusion\nabout what really is evidence for effectiveness  safety. A lot  thgs that we see\nare anecdotal use  drugs like hydroxychloroque  chloroque  patients\nwho have been sick. It's very difficult, statistically speakg,\nto pot out whether or not this is actually effective or\nthe patient just cocidentally got better, which happens Frankly treatment development is\nvery, very difficult busess. Four out  five\ndrugs fail  development. And that exact same failure rate\nshould be expected  developg a treatment for COVID19. On April 2th, White\nHouse health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci revealed promisg\nresults from Gilead s remdesivir. And it is a very\nimportant pro  concept because what it is proven is that a\ndrug can block this virus. Sparkg hope for the development\n an effective treatment agast COVID19. I thk because there's\nso much research to experimental therapies for COVID  there's so\nmany good drug cidates out there. I thk it is likely that\nwe will be able to identify a therapy that has some success with\na period  several months to maybe a year. Fortunately, the development\n a treatment for a novel disease like COVID19, is likely to\nbe faster than ever thanks to recent rapid advancements\n technology. You are seeg now an explosion \ntechnology  new  new startup companies who are becomg adept at\npoolg massive amounts  data to form how to best target a new\ndrug  a novel  a novel target for a particular disease. So AI  ML is becomg a\nreal hot spot through a technology lens for drug discovery, Microst recently announced, the launch \nchat bots known as plasma bots that can help recruit recover\npatients to donate their blood for plasma therapies. While IBM has partnered up with the\nWhite House to launch the COVID19 High Performance\nComputg Consortium. That will make supercomputg power,\navailable for researchers  scientists workg on\ndevelopg a treatment. We have these unique scientific\nstruments which are supercomputers that have been designed historically\nto accelerate the rate  discovery, to be able to\nperform calculations  simulations that would be costly\nto do experimentally. Next generation supercomputers like IBM's\nSummit, the world's fastest supercomputer, or helpg researchers study\nthe virus  narrow down which drugs can be effective\nagast it usg complex simulations. Let's say we want to\nmodel the virus itself. We can represent the structure  the\nvirus  we can use these computers to model its\nbehavior  its teractions. Now, that process  dog\nall those experiments is normally somethg that would take many, many, many\nmonths if you were to do it on a normal computer. But you could do it under\ntwo days because you're usg a supercomputer. Computg power that was\nonce thought to be impossible could entirely change how we\nrespond to future pemics. Right now we are learng  creatg\nnew ways to collaborate on new stitutions  new ways to mobilize\nthe tech sector to respond to the current crisis. Out  this\nwe will defitely not only have lessons learned, but we will\ncreate new mechanisms for coordation to better prepare\nfor future crises. On March 31st, first the\nFDA announced its Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program designed to help\naccelerate the approval process for any potential\ntreatments for COVID19. I am aware  dividual protocols\nthat had been approved with twelve hours. I'm aware  many\nprotocols that have been approved with 2 hours. So the red tape\nhas absolutely been cut. I don't believe this has been done\nat the expense  safety or quality.  fast track approval process\nwill also have an impact on the stock market. On April\ntwenty nth, the White House's announcement on Gilead's remdesivir led to\na two pot seven percent ga for the S&P,  shares \nGilead's s also jumped by five pot seven percent \na sgle day. It is clear that the stock market\nwill respond to the availability  COVID19 treatments  \na positive way. And this is true both for\nthe stock performance  pharmaceutical companies but also for other critical\naspects  our economy  the dustries that are\nengagg with them. Because, aga, gettg treatments that\nare safe  effective to treat COVID19 are critical\nto reopeng our economy."

40,0.0,"Domo's is crushg it  India. It entered the country  1995,\n sce then it's exped rapidly. re are over 1300 domoes across\n282 cities  India  its footprt contues to grow. Domo's has market share \nmore than 70 percent. Domo's  India is even testg\ndelivery  20 mutes or less. That's made it difficult for Pizza\nHut  Papa John's to compete. Even local Indian pizza rivals haven't\nbeen able to match Domo's success. So what is Domo's dog\nthat is so different from the competition? It's localized its product\nfergs, but probably the biggest differentiator, ust like  the\nU.S., Domo's is wng the pizza war  India because it\nfers fast delivery  sophisticated orderg technology. Domo's success has made it more\ndifficult for other chas to flourish. Papa John's left India \n2017, closg 66 doors, accordg to its 2017 fancial filgs. And Pizza Hut footprt has\nstayed relatively small compared to Domo's, despite its early\nentry to the market. On March 2th, 2020. India announced a 21 day lockdown\ndurg the Corona virus outbreak stead  closg its\nstores across the country. Domo's India fers zero contact\ndelivery  pickup to its customers, accordg to\nthe cha's website. Domo's India has taken strategic steps\nto stop the spread  coronavirus by makg sure company\nemployees pass medical checks, temperature screengs for employees\nbefore enterg restaurants, sanitizg protocols for equipment, bags\n delivery boxes every four hours. And employees must\nwash their hs every hour. Pizza Hut has fered similar contactless\ndelivery, but the br is still outnumbered by\nDomo's store count. It has across the subcontent. So how has Domo's\nwon India's pizza war?  pizza market  India is\nvalued at over $1.5 billion. That's small compared to the U.S. market, which is worth\n$6.7 billion dollars. Still, the market is huge considerg\nthe huge population that India has. But when Domo's  Pizza\nHut started operations  India  1995  1996, respectively, the\npizza market was much smaller. It wasn't until July 1991 that India's\nleaders decided to open up its economy, markg the\nbegng  globalization. India removed subsidies on some items,\nlowered some import duties  vited foreign competition . With globalization came American\nbrs like CocaCola, McDonald's, Pizza Hut  Domo's. When ternational pizza chas entered\nIndia  the 1990s, some experts say it wasn't immediately\ncompatible with local tastes. Pizza  India strikes a delicate\nbalance between beg too foreign  not foreign enough. y've been able to kd  walk\nthe tightrope or the balancg act between localizg to an extent that\nis defitely needed to be successful  the Indian market. But aga beg able to balance\nthat with, you know, beg perceived as, you know, that the top\npizza br  the U.S.  globally, not just  India. That brgs a lot  credibility to the\nbr  is why a lot  people want to want to have\nit  comparison to others. Domo's success is also thanks\nto India's huge millennial population. In general, millennials are more\nlikely than their older counterparts to eat food from a restaurant. Use technology, travel \nembrace new foods. Millennials account for about two thirds\n the population  India. And research shows that Indian\nmillennials love eatg out, spendg three times as much on restaurant\nvisits than other forms  entertament. Nielsen research found\nthat middle come urban millennials spend roughly 10 percent \ntheir food budget on eatg at restaurants. That's significantly higher\nthan the 3 percent spent by their Gen X counterparts. As pizza's popularity grows, Domo's has\nfound a huge market  India as  the end  2019. India is Domo's second largest\nmarket after the U.S.. It's a different story\nfor Pizza Hut. Its busess  India makes up\na small fraction  Pizza Hut. Overall busess, the country accounts for\njust one percent  system sales. , on the other h, accounts\nfor 17 percent  Pizza Hut sales. More  more local restaurants\nare startg to fer pizza, too. Let's say the top 10 cities\n India, you would have at least seven to eight brs  pizza which\nare there  would fer at least about who would operate at\nleast five stores  that city. But experts say no Indian chas are\non the verge  becomg national chas. Most are small  privately\nheld, so they're not competg on a national level\nwith American chas. In India, there appears to be a lot\n room for growth  the pizza dustry. Domo's local franchise Jubilant\nFoodWorks had sales  $510 million  fiscal year 2013,\n18 percent higher than the previous year, accordg to FactSet. In fact, Jubilant FoodWorks sales have\nseen double digit growth for 13 out  the last 1 fiscal years. Jubilant FoodWorks also runs Dunk \nIndia  operates its own Chese food cha. But Pizza is the company's most\npritable busess segment by far, makg up 78 percent \nits revenue, accordg to FactSet. Domo's footprt  India is huge\ncompared to its rival Pizza Hut, which has 30 restaurants, accordg\nto its Web site. Domo's has 1,325 stores across 282\ncities as  December thirty first 2019. And it's been addg stores\nsteadily across new cities. y are addg about 200\nplus cities  India. And if I look at the potential,\nthey have the potential  expg to about 500 cities  the country. So that's fairly substantial. Papa John's entered India nearly a decade\n a half after its rivals, Domo's  Pizza Hut had\ncome onto the scene. By the time Papa John's exped to\nIndia, some experts say it was already too late. By the time Papa Jones entered\nthe Indian dustry, Domo's hup is ahead have already established\n therefore br . Many  the consumers used to prefer\nDomo's Pizza Hut to whip up busess because  the affordability,\nbut Papa John's was prized higher. Papa John's tried to close the\ngap  201 by acquirg Pizza Corner, a south Indian cha. At the time  the deal, Papa\nJohn's had 15 stores through its master franchisee for the region, a company\ncalled Ohm Pizza  Eats Papa. John said the acquisition  Pizza\nCorner would exp its presence by at least 0 restaurants. Papa John's had restaurants  11\nIndian cities, accordg to its Twitter account. Its stores were\nconcentrated  the southern  western parts  the country. But some experts say it was a mistake\nnot to branch out to more rural cities. India is a massive country,\nit both population  size part  Domo strategy to familiarize Indians\nwith the br was exped to smaller cities  rural\nareas, not just one region. Developg a restaurant network at a\nnational level  India is challengg due to its huge\nsize  cultural differences between states. But Domo's made it work. But Domo's has vested heavily \nrural areas  not just the cities. And I do thk that is an\nimportant pot as to why they have been successful  particular \ncomparison to their competitors, their ma competitors, such as Pizza\nHut  Papa John's havg access to somethg like pizza is like\nhavg access to the rest  the world feelg like you're a\npart  global consumer culture  that you can try\nsomethg that's different. It has a tremendous amount \nsymbolic value,  I thk Domo's has recognized that  that people are\nwillg to kd  pay for that. Papa John's shut its die\noperations  2017, accordg to local media reports, experts say. Papa John's just couldn't st\nout agast the competition. In the U.S., domos one, the pizza\nwars thanks to delivery  tech novation. It's a similar\nnarrative  India. India has a huge population \nInternet users, second only to . That number is expected to grow, fueled\nby the declg cost  data  smartphones  developg\neconomies like India. Smart bombs are cheaper\noption than personal computers. l this means that the Indian\nmarket is perfect for smartphone apps. Domo's franchisee Jubilant FoodWorks says\nit was the first food service company to launch onle\n mobile orderg nationally  India. Analysts agree  say\nthat Domo's troduced the onle orderg culture. And as  January\n2020, nearly 30 million people downloaded Domo's mobile\norderg app. If you look at a market like\n India, Internet is mostly used through mobiles. So mobile admistration is a\nvery high compared to that  a laptop or desktop. So Domo's were very quick to launch\na mobile app  they also see high orderg retro mobiles \n2013 onle  mobile orders contributed about 17 percent  delivery\nsales at Domo's by the end  fiscal year 2019. Onle orderg contributed seventy five\npercent  delivery sales. Domo's has stood out \nthe Indian delivery market guaranteeg customers free pizza if a delivery\ntakes 30 mutes or longer. Domo's even tested a 20 mutes\nor less delivery guarantee  some Indian cities  fers all\nnight delivery  multiple cities. While Domo's has succeeded  delivery\n with its mobile app, experts say Pizza Hut was focused more\non dg  just like it has  the U.S.. Some consumers prefer that,\nbut it means that Pizza Hut needs to rent large  usually\nmore expensive real estate to fer seatg. I may have to travel to\na particular pot  the city just to eat at a Pizza Hut or a\nPizza Express that at times it takes away from, though, you know, the desire to\ngo there or you're not just orderg, then you're\nmore comfortable. While many fast food brs look\nto  for growth, Domo's has struggled there.  company attributes that\nto the fact that cheese  bread aren't part \na traditional Chese diet. In India, the pizza cha\nhasn't had that problem. Domo's tries to make sure its\nmenu is wellsuited to every country. It exps to. In addition to ferg American\nstaples like sausage  veggie, Domo's, India serves pies topped\nwith familiar gredients like chicken tikka paneer cheese\n red paprika. Chicken is the most\npopular meat  India. And Hdus don't eat beef, which\nis why chicken domates the onle menu at Domo's. It's even hyper localized its products\nby region ettg menu items more suited to tastes\n certa states. For stance,  201, South Indian\ncustomers got a spicy banana pizza. Green bananas are ten\nused  traditional South Indian dishes. Domo's localize more\nthan its menu. It tailored each restaurant\nto local conditions, too.

43,0.0,"Juden peterson you've said that men need to quote grow the hell up tell me why well because there's nothg uglier than an old fant there's nothg good about it it people who don't grow up don't fd the sort  meang  their life that sustas them through difficult times  they are certa to encounter difficult times  they're left bitter  resentful  without purpose  adrift  hostile  resentful  vengeful  arrogant  deceitful    no use to themselves   no use to anyone else  no partner for a woman  there's nothg  it that's good so you said I mean that sounds pretty bad yes Isis  masculity I mean what do you do about it you tell you help people underst why it's necessary  important for them to grow up  adopt responsibilities why that isn't a shake your fger  get your act together sort  thg why it's more like but why it's more like a deleation  the kd  desty that makes life worth livg I've been tellg young men but it's not I wasn't specifically aimg this message at young men to beg with it just kd  turned out that way  it's mostly you admit it's mostly men listeng I mean it is your audience is well it's about 80 percent on on YouTube which is a YouTube is a male doma primarily so it's hard to tell how much  it is because YouTube is male  how how much  it is because  what I'm sayg but you you what I've been tellg young men is that there's an actual reason why they need to grow up which is that they have somethg to fer you know that that that people have with them this capacity to set the world straight  that's necessary to manifest  the world  that also dog so is where you fd the meang that sustas you  life so what's gone wrong then oh god all sorts  thgs have gone wrong I thk that I don't thk that young men are here words  encouragement some some  them never  their entire lives as far as I can tell that's what they tell me  the fact that the words that I've been that I've been speakg the YouTube lectures that I've done  put onle for example have had such a dramatic impact is dication that young men are starvg for this sort  message because like why  the world would they have to derive it from a lecture on YouTube now they're not beg taught that they that it's important to develop yourself because it doesn't bother you that your audience is predomantly male does that isn't isn't that a bit divisive no I don't thk so I mean it's no more divisive than the fact that YouTube is primarily male  tumblr is primarily my female resident tumblr is primarily female all right you're just sayg that's the way it is oh it's I'm not sayg anythg it's just an observation that that's the way it is there's plenty  women that are watchg my lectures  comg to my talks  buy my books it's just that the majority  them happen to be men uh it's what's  it for the women though well what sort  partner do you want you want an overgrown child or do you want someone to contend with that's gog to help you your eye on women have some sort  duty to sort  help fix the crisis masculity it depends on what they want no I mean it's exactly exactly how I laid it out like women want deeply want men who are competent  powerful   I don't mean power   the   the  that they can exert tyrannical control over others that's not power that's just corruption power is competence  why  the world would you not want a competent partner well I know why actually you can't domate a competent partner so if you want more you should domate is that what you're sayg no I'd say women who have had their relationships impaired with impaired their relationships with men impaired  who are afraid  such relationships will settle for a weak partner because they can domate them but it's a suboptimal solution do you know when they were dog I thk there's a substantial mority  women who do that  I thk it's very bad for them they're very unhappy it's very bad for their partners although the partners get the advantage  not havg to take any responsibility what gives you the right to say that I mean maybe that's how women want their relationships those women I mean you're makg these vast generalizations I'm a clical psychologist right so you've you're sayg you've done your research  women are unhappy domatg men I didn't say they were unhappy domatg then I said it was a bad longterm solution okay you said it was makg them Israel yes yes  it depends on the time frame I mean there can be there's tense pleasure  momentary domation that's why people do it all the time but its nose formula for a longterm successful longterm relationship that's reciprocal right any longterm relationship is reciprocal firstly by defition so let me put it quite to you from the bank well you say there are whole disciples  universities forthrightly hostile towards men these are the areas  study domated by the postmodern stroke neomarxist claim the Western culture  particular is an oppressive structure created by white men to domate  exclude women but then I want to put morities  okay but I want to put to you that here  the  for example let's say that as an example the gender pay gap sts at just over 9% you've got women at the  recently sayg that the broadcaster is illegally payg them less than men to do the same job you've got only seven women runng the top footsie 100 companies hum so it seems to a lot  women that they still beg domated  excluded to quote your words back to you it does seem that way but multivariate analysis  the pay gap dicate that it doesn't exist ne percent cap ager that's a gap between median hourly earngs between men  women yeah but there's multiple reasons for that one  them is gender but it's not the only reason like if you're a social scientist worth worth your salt you never do a univariate analysis like you say well women  aggregate are paid less than men okay well then we break it down by age we break it down by occupation we break it down by terest we break it down by personality but you're sayg basically it doesn't matter if women aren't gettg to the top because that's what's skewg that gender pay gap isn't it you're sayg well that's just a fact not so you know it's not gog to get to the top no I'm not sayg it doesn't matter either you're sayg remdful reasons for it even though why should women put up with those reasons why shouldn't women because he should put up with it I'm sayg that the claim that the wage gap between men  women is only due to sex is wrong  it is wrong there's no doubt about that the multivariate analysis have been done mighty very I'm sayg that ne percent pay gap exists that's a gap between men  women I'm not sayg why it exists but it exists now you're a woman wack seems pretty unfair you have to say why it exists but do you agree that it's unfair if you're a woman not necessary  on average you're gettg paid ne percent less than a man that's not fair is it it depends on why it's happeng I can give you an example okay there's a personality trait known as agreeableness agreeable people are compassionate  polite  agreeable people get paid less than just didn't less agreeable people for the same job women are more agreeable than men aga a vast generalizations agreeable ears that's true but that's right  some women get paid more than men so you were sayg that by  large women are too agreeable to get the pay raises I see so I'm sayg that that's one component  a multivariate equation that predicts celery it accounts for maybe five percent  the variance somethg like that I should be neat about the other twenty you need about another eighteen factors one  which is gender  there is prejudice there's no doubt about that but it accounts for a much smaller proportion  the variance  the pay gap then the radical femists claim okay so rather than denyg the pay gap exists which is what you did at the begng  this conversation shouldn't you say to women rather than beg agreeable  not askg for a pay rise go  ask for a pay raise make yourself disagreeable with your book oh defitely there's that but I also didn't deny it existed I denied it existed because  gender okay because I'm very very very careful with my words so the pay gap exists you accept that but you're sayg I mean the pay gap between men  women exists you're sayg it's not because  gender it's because women are too agreeable to ask for pay rises certaly one  the reasons okay one  the reason so why not get them to ask for a pay rise I've done that many many times  my career  they just don't sort oh they do it all the time you can see so one  the thgs that you do as a clical psychologist is um assertiveness trag so you might say ten you treat people for anxiety you treat them for depression  you  maybe the next most common category after that would be assertiveness trag  so I've had many many women extraordarily competent women  my clical  consultg practice  we put together strategies for their career development that volved contual pushg competg for higher wages  ten tripled their wages with a fiveyear period  course so do you do you agree that you would be happy if that pay gap was elimated completely because that's all the radical femists are sayg it would depend on how it was eradicated  how the how how the disappearance  it was measured  you're sayg  men that's a problem oh there's all sorts  thgs that it could be at the cost  it could even be at the cost  women's own terests so because they might not be happy if they could equal pay no because it might terfere with other thgs that are causg the pay gap that women are choosg tonight havg children well or choosg careers that actually happen to be paid less which women do a lot  but why shouldn't women have the right to choose not to have children or the right to choose those demg because they can yeah that's fe but you're sayg that makes them unhappy I  large I'm sayg that that no I'm not sayg that I'm I  I actually haven't said that so far you're sayg it makes them miserable no I said what was makg them miserable was havg part was havg weak partners that makes them miserable right I would say that many women around the age  I would say between 28  32 have a career family crisis that they have to deal with  I thk that's partly because  the for short  timeframe that women have to contend with like women have to get the major pieces  their life put together faster than men which is also partly why men aren't under so much pressure to grow up so because for the typical woman she has to have her career  family  order pretty much by the time she's 35 because otherwise the options start to run out  so that puts a tremendous amount  stress on women especially at the end  their 20s I thk I take issue the idea  the typical woman because you know all women are different  I want to just put another quote to you from the book last day  some ways  the same  others okay you say women become more vulnerable when they have children no  you talked to one  your youtube terviews about crazy harpy sisters so a simple question is gender equality a myth  your view is that somethg that's just never gonna happen it depends on what you mean by equality no if you mean a lien  we're gettg the same opportunities fairly people we could get to a pot where people were treated fairly or more fairly I mean people are treated pretty fairly  Western culture already but we can look them really not though are they I mean otherwise why would there only be seven women runng footsie 100 companies  the  why why would there still be a pay gap which we've all got satellite sees why are women at the  sayg that they're gettg paid illegally less the men to do the same job that's not fair sort  the first question their brothers are complicated questions seven seven women repeat that one there's seven women runng the top footsie 100 companies  the  well the first it might be um why would you want to do that why would a mute man want to do it I don't know a number  men although not that many who are perfectly willg to sacrifice virtually all  their life to the pursuit  a highend career so they'll work these are men that are very telligent they're usually very very conscientious they're very driven they're very highenergy they're very healthy  they're willg to work 70 or 80 hours a week nonstop specialised at one thg to get to the top so you thk women are just more sensible they don't want that because it's not a nice level I'm sayg that's part  it defitely  so I worry you you don't thk there are barriers  their way that prevent them gettg to the top there's some barriers yeah like other like men for example I mean to get to the top  any organisation is an credibly competitive enterprise  the men that you're competg with are simply not gog to roll over  say please take the position absolutely allout warfare is gender equality a myth I don't know what you mean by the question men  women aren't the same  they won't be this that doesn't mean they can't be treated fairly is gender equality desirable if it means equality  outcome then almost certaly it's undesirable that's already been demonstrated  Scavia because  Scavia equality  outcome is undesirable what men  women won't sort themselves to the same categories if you leave them alone to do it f their own accord I've already seen that  Scavia it's 20 to 1 female nurses to male somethg like that it might not be quite that extreme  approximately the same male engeers to female engeers  that's a consequence  the free choice  men  women  the societies that have gone farther than any other societies to make gender equality the purpose  the law those are  eradicable differences you can eradicate them with tremendous social pressure  tyranny but if you leave men  women to make their own choices you will not get equal outcome right so you're sayg that anyone who believes  equality whether you call them femists call them whatever you want to call them should basically give up because it a't gonna happen only if they're aimg at equality  outcome so you're sayg give people equality  opportunity that's fe not only fe it's emently desirable for everyone for dividuals  for society but still women aren't gonna make it that's what you're really it depends on your measurement techniques they're dog just fe  medice  fact there are far more female physicians than there are male physicians or there are lots  lots  disciples that are absolutely domated by women many many disciples  they're dog great so let me put somethg else to you from the book you say the troduction  the equal pay for equal work argument immediately complicates even salary comparison beyond practicality for one simple reason who decides what work is equal it's not possible so the simple question is do you believe  equal pay well I made the argument there it's like it depends  say you don't because a lot  people listeng to you will just say I mean are we gog back to the Dutch because we're actually not listeng I'm just projectg I'm hearg you basically sayg women need to just accept they're never gonna make it on equal terms equal outcomes is what how you defed it no I I would go I might as well just go  play with my Cdy dolls give us a ride at school because I'm not gog to get the top job I want because there's someone sittg there sayg it's not possible that's what they said it's a it's a bad social role I didn't say that women shouldn't be strivg for the top or anythg like that because I don't believe that for a second strivg for the top but you're gonna put all those hurdles  their way as has been  their way for centuries so that's fe you're sayg that's fe no no I thk I read the paper silly I do I thk that's silly I really do I mean look look at your situation you're hardly unsuccessful yeah Maya how do you beg hard to get exactly good that's ok battlg is good this is evitable but you talk about man fuck let me just put another thg to you for now you're sayg you have to be idle for a highquality position well I notice  your book you talk about real conversations between men contag quote an underlyg threat  physicality oh there's no doubt about that what about real conversation between women is that somethg or are we sort  too amenable  reasonable no it's just that the doma  physical conflict is sort  flimits for you we just to get where I've got yeah but what does that make me I don't know man I don't image that you've yeah to some degree I suspect you're not very agreeable so that's the thg successful women I'm not very agreeable right actually  this conversation at least I'm sure I served your career well successful women though hmm basically have to wear the trousers  your view they have to sort  become men to succeed is what you're sayg well if the guys had to fight to succeed better Canadians men certaly mascule traits are gog to be helpful I mean one  the thgs I do  my counselg practice for example when I'm consultg with women who are tryg to advance their careers is to teach them how to negotiate  to  to be able to say no  to not be easily pushed around  to be formidable  you need to if you're gonna be successful you need to be smart conscientious  tough well here's a radical idea why don't the bosses adopt some male bosses shall we say adopt some female traits so the women don't have to fight  get their sharp elbows out for the pay rises it's just accepted if they're dog the same job they get the same pay well I would say partly because it's not so easy to determe what cost due to the same job an almost because arguably yeah there are still men domatg our dustries our society  therefore they've dictated the terms for so long but women have to battle to know like them it's not true it's not true so for example well I can give you an example very quickly so I worked with women who worked  highpowered law firms  Canada for about 15 years  they were as competent  put together as anybody you would ever meet  we were tryg to figure out how to further their careers  there was a huge debate  Canadian society at that pot that was basically ran along the same les as your argument is that if the law firms didn't use these mascule criteria then perhaps women would do better but the market sets the damn game it's like  the market is domated by men no it's not the market is domated by women they make 80 percent  the consumer decisions that's not the case at all you take people who stay at home lookg after children by  large they are still women so they're gog out dog the shoppg but that is chaed they make all decisions okay so the market is driven by women not men right ok  if you're a lawyer you still pay more for the same sort  goods that's been proven that men for the you buy a blue bicycle helmet it's gonna cost less than a pk one anyway we'll come on to that partly because men are less agreeable right so this so they won't put up with it I want to ask you is it not desirable to have some  those female traits you're talkg about I'd say that's a generalization but you've used the words female traits is it not desirable to have some  them at the top  busess I mean maybe they wouldn't they don't predict they don't predict success  the workplace the thgs that predict success  the workplace are telligence  conscientiousness agreeableness negatively predicts success  the workplace negative emotion sayg that women aren't telligent enough to run these talk no I didn't say that I said that female traits don't predict success but I didn't say that telligence it wasn't I didn't say that telligence  conscientious when you were sayg it's just by implication or not female traits oh no I mean that's sorry no dressed her not sayg that at all a women is telligent than men no no they're not no they did that on that's pretty cool the average IQ for a woman  the average IQ for a man is identical there is some debate about the flatness  the distribution which is somethg that James d'amour poted out for example  his memo but there's no difference at all  general cognitive ability there's no difference to speak   conscientiousness women are a bit more orderly than men  men are a little bit more dustrious than women the difference isn't big I don't know about averages to con men who aren't necessarily why are they not feme traits why are they not desirable at the top  feme traits why they not desirable it's hard to say I'm just layg out the empirical evidence like we know that we know the traits that predict success but we also know because companies by  large have not been domated by women over the centuries we have nothg to compare it to it's an experiment true  it could be the case that if companies modified their behavior  became more feme they would be successful there's no evidence for it I'm not neither doubtful nor non doubtful there's no evidence why not give it a go as the radically evidence suggests well it's fe like if someone wants to start a company  make it more feme  compassionate let's say  carg  its overall orientation towards its workers  towards the marketplace  that's a perfectly reasonable experiment to run my pot is that there is no evidence that those traits predict success  the workplace  there's evidence right well that's not that's not really the case women have been  the workplace for at least ever sce I've been around the representation  women  the workplace has been about 50 percent so we've run the experiment for a fairly reasonable period  time but not you know certaly not for centuries let me move on to another debate that's been very controversial for you  this is you got  trouble for refusg to call trans men  women by their preferred personal pronouns no it's not actually true I got  trouble because I said I would not follow that compelled speech dictates  the federal  provcial government I actually never got  trouble for not callg anyone anythg I wouldn't follow the change  law which was does not once I was law screamg hell no that's all they said it was designed to do okay you cited freedom  speech  that why should your right to freedom  speech Trump a trans persons right not to be fended because  order to be able to thk you have to risk beg fensive I mean look at the conversation we're havg right now you know like you're certaly willg to risk fendg me  the pursuit  truth why should you have the right to do that it's beg rather uncomfortable well I'm I'm very glad I put you well I'm you get my pot as like you're you're dog what you should do which is diggg a bit to see what the hell's gog on  that is what you should do but you're exercisg your freedom  speech to certaly risk fendg me  that's fe I thk more power to as far as I'm concerned so you haven't sat there  I'm just right I've just tryg to work that out I mean ha gotcha you have got me you have caught me I'm tryg to wake up turn my head yeah I took a while it did yeah well you have voluntary cut you have voluntarily come to the studio  agreed to be questioned hmm a trans person  your class has come to your class  said they want to be called that's never happened  I would call them she so you would so you've kd  changed your Chi no no no I said that right from the begng what I said at the begng was that I was not gog to cede the lguistic territory to radical leftists regardless  whether or not it was put  law that's what I said even then the people who came after me said oh you must be transphobic  you'd mistreat a student  your class it's like I never mistreated a student  my class I'm not transphobic  that isn't what I said well it said you've also called trans campaigners authoritarian how many I mean isn't that only  the broader context  my claims that radical leftist ideologue czar authoritarian which they always say someone who's tryg to work out their gender identity who may well have struggled with that though I'm a drug use you're comparg them with you know Chairman Mao who know just you know the deaths  millions  people just even if the activists you know they're trans people too they have a right to say these thgs yeah but they don't have a bra side their whole community heaven too Chairman Mao you know I could fish a all cost a penny sure I mean you know this is grossly sensitive  I didn't compare them to fish it well I did come here knowg he knows no authority he's a rightwger though I was comparg them to the leftwg totalitarians  I are left now at Aryans under Mao millions  people die right mean there's no comparison Mao  a trans activist is there why not because trans activist aren't killg millions  people the philosophy that's guidg their utterances is the same philosophy the consequences are yet you're sayg that trans activists know it leads to the deaths  millions  people well no I'm sayg that the philosophy that drives their utterances is the same philosophy that already has driven us to the deaths  millions okay tell us how that philosophy is  any way comparable sure that's no problem the first thg is is that their philosophy presumes that group identity is paramount that's the fundamental philosophy that drove the Soviet Union  Mao is   it's the fundamental philosophy  the leftwg activists it's identity politics doesn't matter who you are as an dividual it matters who you are  terms  your group identity you just say murder so to provoke on you I mean you are a provocateur never say a lightly they don't write that you hate to be compared to you want to stir thgs up I'm only a provocateur sar as when I say what I believe to be true it's provocative I don't provoke maybe four heroes out now  then I'm not terested  provokg what about leadg about you know fightg  the lobster tell us about the lobster ha well that's quite a segue well the first chapter I have  my book is called st up straight with your shoulders back  it's an junction to be combative not least to further your career let's say but also to adopt a stance  ready engagement with the world  to reflect that  your posture  the reason that I write about lobsters is because there's this idea that hierarchical structures are a sociological construct  the Western patriarchy  that is so untrue that it's almost unbelievable  I use the lobster as an example because the lobster we we divulged from lobsters  evolutionary history about 350 million years ago common ancestor  lobsters exist  hierarchies  have a nervous system attuned to the hierarchy  that nervous system runs on seroton just like our nervous systems do  the nervous system  the lobster  the human beg is so similar that antidepressants work on lobsters  it's part  my attempt to demonstrate that the idea  hierarchy has absolutely nothg to do with sociocultural constructions which it doesn't let me just get it straight you're sayg that we should organize our societies along the les  the lobsters I'm sayg that it's evitable that there will be contuity  the way that animals  human begs organizg organize their structures it's it's absolutely evitable  there is one third  a billion years  evolutionary history behd that right that's that's so long that a third  the billion years ago there weren't even trees it's a long time you have a mechanism  your bra that runs on seroton that's similar to the lobster mechanism that tracks your status  the higher your status the better your emotions are regulated so as your seroton levels crease you feel more positive the emotion  less negative emotion so you're sayg like the lobsters we're hardwired as men  women to do certa thgs to sort  run along tram les  there's nothg we can do about it no I'm not sayg there's nothg we can do about it because it's like  a chess game all right there's lots  thgs that you can do although you can't break the rules  the chess game  contue to play chess  biological you're your biological nature is somewhat like that is it sets the rules  the game but with those rules you have a lot  leeway but the idea that but one thg we can't do is say that hierarchical organization is a consequence  the capitalist patriarchy it's like that's patently absurd it's wrong it's not a matter  opion it's seriously wrong on you just whippg people up to a state  anger  not  all the divisions between men  women you're disturbg people up you know you have any critics  you onle get absolutely lambasted by your followers young generally sorry your critics get lambasted by you I mean if there are not at all if an academic is gonna come to me  tell me that I'm not qualified  that I'm not I don't know what I'm talkg about now quit the abuse quit the anger well we need some substantial examples  the abuse  the anger before I could detail that quest there 'he's a lot  alpha well let's take a more general perspective on that so I have had 25,000 letters sce June somethg like that from people who told me that I've brought them back from the brk  destruction  so I'm perfectly willg to put that up agast the rather vague accusations that my followers are makg the lives  people that I've targeted miserable Jordan Peterson thank you my pleasure nice talkg me you"

47,0.0," global climate is changg\nfaster than expected,  the effects are\nalready pla to see. Too much water — from\nstorms  floodg — is drivg people\nfrom their homes. Elsewhere too little water is robbg\npeople  their livelihoods. l this could produce the largest\nwave  migration  human history. Up to a billion people may be displaced\nby climate change  this century. Initially, most will be poor\npeople  the global south — even as the wealthy north\nseals its borders. It’s true that we humans are\ncausg climate change. It’s real \nit exists. People who deny it are\nlyg to themselves. y can see  feel the effects\n it  their surroundgs; they can feel the effects\n climate change. In the Philippes the future has\nalready arrived. Tropical storms, floodg  heavy ras are\nstrikg at ever shorter tervals —  growg\n tensity. Climate change is the worst creation\nto be produced by our species. We humans have created\nclimate change. And more  more people\nare on the run from it: If sea levels rise to the extent\nthat scientists have predicted, then by 2030, millions people on the coasts\nworldwide will be  acute danger.  densely populated coastal regions\n Asia will be most affected. Buangan is an isl\ndistrict on the Bay  Manila. Here water is already\neatg away at the l. Every year this community has been\nskg four to six centimeters deeper to the sea. Residents have to rebuild their houses on\nthe rotops  their old, sunken homes. What scares me the most about\nthis steady sea water rise is that someday we won’t\neven see the ros anymore. Entire houses\nwill vanish. And at the same time we’ll keep tryg to build up the\nground through l reclamation. rge de Omaña —\nwho goes by Jojo — is capta  the\ncommunity’s rescue vessel. He has been homeless\nfor years now. Sce the risg water\nmade his house unlivable, he has been sleepg\nat his workplace. Jojo doesn’t come\nhere much anymore. After the water began to destroy their\nhome, his wife took their son  left. At high tide, everythg\nhere is submerged.  water was\nkneedeep here. We had to stow thgs  higher\nplaces to keep them safe. If the water\nreached the bed, we had to wait for it to\nsubside before we could sleep. This was a happy home. We usually had visitors\n— friends, relatives. We’d all be together side this\nhouse, chattg, sharg meals, sometimes drkg. Now it’s makes me sad to thk\nabout this house  aboned. Jojo dreams \nrestorg his house, but at the moment he\ndoesn’t have enough money. Many families have\nbeen torn apart.  young people move away to seek work.\nIn 2018 alone, an estimated 3.8 million\npeople  the Philippes fled from storms \nnatural disasters. wide most refugees are ternally\ndisplaced  their own countries. In the end, everyone  Buangan\nwill be driven out by climate change.  dead can no longer be buried here;\nthey have to be taken to the mal. re are still 6,000 people\nlivg here,  cramped quarters. Buangan is skg due to\nerosion  risg sea levels. I can see the extent \nenvironmental destruction.  life  people  Buangan is\nbound up with the water around us. Sea levels are risg worldwide as the\ntemperature  the atmosphere creases, causg ice at the\npoles to melt. That crease is due to the rise\n greenhouse gas emissions — especially carbon\ndioxide, CO2. It is released when we burn coal, oil\n gas  dustry, heatg  cars.  biggest CO2 emitters are\nthe big dustrial nations — above all,  \nthe United States. I’ve seen big changes here. Back when I was 15 or 20 years old\nthe ray season was normal —  May, June, July. But now we get frost\n those months. In the past we didn’t have those problems.\nI can feel the changes.  ray season\nis comg later,  at the same time we\nkeep havg cold snaps. In the summer we have long\nperiods without ra. We suffer from that —  then\nsuddenly we have too much ra. Pilar Jacto Pablo grew up here\n the highls  Guatemala. She's grown potatoes all her life. But\n recent years, thgs have changed. This little plant — as you can see\n— isn’t strong enough to survive. We can’t use it for seeds or\npotato production. It’s a loss. Every year, drought  frost\ndestroy many potato plants — which is all Pilar  her\nfamily grow on their fields. In Guatemala’s Western Highls,\nmost people are smallscale farmers,  three quarters \nthem live  poverty. Durg the ray season from May to\nOctober, the countryside changes from dusty  dry, to lush  green.\nFor Pilar this would be the most\ntroublefree part  the year — if only rafall patterns\nwere like they used to be. Water is so important for\nus  the community because we have no natural water sources.\nWe depend on the ra for water. That’s why we buy contaers \ncanisters to catch the water. When the summer comes that’s the\nonly way to store a bit  water. It’s very important for our\ncommunities  our plantations. Without water we\ncan do nothg. Around half the residents  Todos\nSantos have gone to the United States. After every drought,\nmore  more leave. Most  the men are now\nworkg  the US. Every month, they send\na few hundred dollars. Pilar’s house was built\nwith US dollars.  family also uses the money to pay the\nstallments on a loan they took out to fance the trip \nthe people smugglers. Like most here, Pilar  her family\nare Mam, an digenous Mayan people. Pilar lives together with her\nchildren  grchildren. Pilar’s husb emigrated\nthree years ago. y now make their decisions\ntogether over the phone. Without my husb’s help\nit would be very difficult. When our harvest fails,\nwe lose all our money. If my husb didn’t send\nmoney we wouldn’t get by. And it's not just this\none piece  l. We have more l where\nharvests have failed. Without his help we'd\nlose a lot  money. As an illegal immigrant, her husb could\nbe deported from the US at any time, so he doesn’t\nwant to be named. Pilar knows that migrants\nfrom Central America are no longer welcome\n the United States. You know, it's really difficult\nwhen you thk  Donald Trump, what he\nbelieves. He's so contradictory   so\nmany different scenarios, right? You're gog to build up this wall\nbut you're sayg on Twitter: climate change\nis a hoax. As climate change exacerbates\nother thgs that are gog on, it's defitely becomg either\na secondary or a primary reason why people\nare leavg. And their answer  course is this,\nright: Buildg up a border wall, buildg up what we see\nbefore us right now. re is still no legally\naccepted defition for terms such as “climate refugee” even though the  Bank predicts that\nMexico  Central America will have at least 1. million ternal climate\nmigrants over the next 30 years —  many more who\nwill migrate abroad.  number  Guatemalans\nmigrants registered at the southwest US border has\nqutupled  the past three years. Todd Miller is an author who writes about\nsecurity policy  climate change. He’s been observg developments at\nthe USMexican border for years. If you go along the\n2,000mile USMexico border there's about 650 miles  either\nwalls or barriers  some sort. re's all kds\n technologies, billions  billions  dollars \ntechnologies, from hightech cameras, cameras that can see seven miles\naway, radar systems, drones. re's a fleet \napproximately ten drones. re's other thgs that you\nsee  US military operations. re's been a lot \nthese kds  transfers from conflict zones abroad to here. Now the United States has a new\nconflict zone on its own doorstep. It’s a crisis that the US  other\ndustrial nations have helped to create. re's seven hundred times more carbon\nemissions from the United States sce 1900 than Guatemala, El\nSalvador,  Honduras combed — seven hundred times more. Yet this\nis the country that's fortifyg its borders from people who\nare obviously impacted by those sorts  excessive\namounts  emissions  I thk: How could that be possible?\nI mean, we've known about the science for so many years \nwe had more than ever before. But at the same time there's more\nborder walls than ever before, too. Like this is a kd  adaptation plan\n— right? — for the richer countries. When David Ramos arrived\n Arizona eight years ago there was no reception\ncenter for migrants. He’s still waitg for a\npermanent residence permit. I’ll always feel like a Guatemalan.\nI don’t feel American. That’s where I come from \nI’ll only be here for a while. I don’t have a green card\nyet, but what can I do? No matter what, I’ll\nalways be Guatemalan. David has a work permit that has\nto be renewed every two years. Even if he were to be expelled, what\nhe's achieved here is somethg that many back home\ncan only dream . And he earns enough to help\nsupport his family  Guatemala. He grew up there on his parents’\nfarm as one  ne children. I didn’t enjoy my childhood all that much.\nBut it was an ordary childhood. We grew up workg. My brothers worked\nwith my father, my sisters with my mother. n I started to look for a way to earn a\nlivg,  how I could contue my studies. So I got a job\n a workshop. Here  the US he works\nas a freelance gardener. It’s very different\nfrom Guatemala. A lot grows  the hot season, even\nthough there’s hardly any water. Arizona has a desert climate\n a severe lack  water. Life here is only possible thanks to water\npiped from the faraway Colorado River. But the cities  Phoenix  Tucson\nstill use the resource wastefully. y’re counted among the least\nsustaable cities  the world. Hundreds  thouss\n liters  water go to keepg golf courses\n the desert green. It’s a different life here. y have more ways \ntreatg the water. We don’t have that  Guatemala. I\ncan’t judge if that’s fair or unfair. Thgs are more\nadvanced here. When you look at their houses,\nthey’re not wastg water. y’re usg it\nfor their plants. And sce they have money, they can\npay for as much water as they want. David says someday he’d like\nto live like his clients —  his own house with a garden. To achieve that goal he\nworks six days a week. Beautiful,\nthank you! Thank you so much,\nhave a nice day! Have a good\nweekend! Thank\nyou. He just earned 65 dollars cash,\nfor an hour  gardeng. David married a Guatemalan\nwoman  the US. She comes from the same\nhighl region as he does. He lives here  a trailer park\nwith his wife  daughter. On Sundays David likes to drive out to\nthe desert.  hills remd him  home. He’d like to go back to Guatemala\nsomeday to see his family, but without a Green Card he\nwouldn’t be able to reenter the US. It makes me sad. It’s tough to\nbe separated from your family. y’re over there  only I’m here.\nBut what can you do? We’re separated, not because we want to be, but because\nwe are forced to be by necessity. Over there, you can’t\nmake ends meet. I'll never leave here. As\nlong as this world remas, Buangan will\nrema Buangan. Conditions  the ocean are changg; the\nfishermen are catchg less  less. y can hardly earn\na prit nowadays. most every family has at least\none member who has left Buangan. It’s true that people\nare leavg here. y’ve gone to work\noverseas — or  Manila. As far as I can tell, the water level\nhere  Buangan will contue to rise. But we’ll contue to build it up,\nto reclaim our beloved neighborhood.  people  Buangan won’t let\nthis place vanish beneath the waves. Not everyone here believes that\nthe community can be saved. Every day, Jojo’s neighbor\nMelody fds her house flooded. I dream  settlg \nanother place, not here. But my husb, Jay, is from here\n he doesn’t want to leave. I’m origally from the\nmal, from Navotas. But Jay comes from here \nhe won't leave this place. re are plenty\n dications. First, the warngs on the\nradio,  on the television. When a strong typhoon is approachg\nwe start tyg down the ros. We tie them down so they won't\nbe blown away by the wd. And we usually buy supplies before the\nstorm so that we have somethg to eat, the basics, while the storm\nsweeps through the village. From typhoons\nto storms, extreme weather has grown more\nfrequent  recent years. Scientists still don’t know\nto what extent this rise is connected to humuced\nclimate change. Any place you look at that's\nsupposedly a victim  climate change— no they're a victim  lack  freedom.\ny have very little capability. And so yeah, everythg sucks\ncludg the climate sucks, but it's not because\nwe put more CO2  it, it is just because life sucks\nwhen you're a human beg on a difficult planet\nwith very low capability. For example, if you look at the US, we\nhave every form  climate imagable. We have a polar\nclimate  aska. We have like swampy Florida or\nwe have California where I live which I thk is the\nnicest climate. But we all have life\nexpectancies over 75. Why? Because when human begs are\nsufficiently capable they can adapt to  even master any climate versus\nwhen they have very low capability when they're  primitive  poor\nsocieties they can't deal with anythg. So I thk one  the big thgs that's\nmisplaced  the climate discussion, is there's not enough focus on how\ndo we crease human capability. I'm an energy philosopher, which means\nI try to help people thk more clearly about energy \nenvironmental issues. ex Epste is widely known\nas a climate change skeptic. At least 13 percent  Americans\nshare his views on global warmg — a higher proportion than \nany other western country. Epste advises oil companies on how\nto sell their products better — also usg climate\ndenial arguments. People have a very deepseated fear \nchangg our environment. And I thk that causes them when we change our\nenvironment through fossil fuels, through say havg a warmg\nfluence on climate, I thk people tend to exaggerate\n get overly fearful, versus lookg at\nit proportionally. Sce the 19th century the\nUS has burned more coal, oil  natural gas\nthan any other country.  current admistration has refused to\ntake responsibility for that —   2019 ficially gave notice\nthat the US is withdrawg from the Paris Climate Agreement. That’s bad news for the\ncountries  the global south. y’re already are the ones most\naffected by climate change —  are least able to\ndeal with the impact. I thk it's been great for\nus to have a lot  energy but also it's been amazgly positive\nfor the poorer parts  the world that we've used\nall this energy. So what's happened is we've been\nspendg decades  decades  decades thkg about how to improve life\ncludg thgs like medical discoveries that have then been shared  large part\nwith the poorer parts  the world. So there's a certa narrative that\nwe've made people's lives worse but no, the wealthy world has made  so far as\nthey've created all  this novation has made everyone's\nlives better. So I don't thk we should\nfeel guilty about it. And I thk we should be very proud. I thk that humanity — there are a lot \nproblems, but life has never been better  the earth has never been\na better place to live. And I thk most people if they\nthk about it would agree. I don't thk they would want to go\nback to 50 years ago or 100 years ago. In the Arizona desert, scientists at\nthe Biosphere 2 experimental station are tryg to fd out how to model \nperhaps save the Earth’s major ecosystems. Biosphere started out as the world's largest\necological experiment ever conducted with a closed or controlled\nenvironment to try to replicate Earth's systems  to\nbetter underst it.  earth is\n unique  we know that that uniqueness is\nwhat allows us to live  survive. And if those conditions\nchange so much so it could defitely threaten\nor it will threaten our survival. And so I thk understg what\nthose potential implications are before they actually\nplay out are crucial.  research center houses\nseven model ecosystems. It’s a unique place where, under\nclosetorealworld conditions, it is possible to test\nhow natural systems will respond to extreme\nenvironmental change.  researchers can control the climate\n measure how the ecosystem reacts. In the model raforest an\nternational team  scientists are studyg what happens\nwhen there is less ra.  unique thg here is that  the\nBiosphere we can control the entire forest. We can decide when it will ra,\n how much. We’re measurg how the\ntropical raforest responds when it is still \nits normal state. And then we’re gog to itiate a long\ndrought  see how the ecosystem behaves. Once it gets drier, the\nrate  photosynthesis — goes down. We want to know at what pot a\nsystem like this reaches its limits. It's important to know what will happen\n the world’s forests  the future. Trees store CO2, the climate gas that\ncauses this atmospheric warmg, which arises from the combustion\n fossil substances. Plants take it up\ndurg photosynthesis. What we see around the world\nis that up to 30 percent  the emissions that we put to the\natmosphere can be taken up aga by forests. So they act as a huge buffer that\nhelps mitigate the climate effect. Without them, it\nwould be much worse. Scientists first warned about\nglobal warmg decades ago — but it took years for the message\nto even beg to sk . Today it’s apparent\nthat the climate is changg faster than\nscientists had predicted. But at the end  the day we\nare all habitants  Earth. And so what happens here  the\nUS or what happens  Europe or Asia at some pot is\ngog to impact all  us. So I thk it behooves all  us to\nrecognize that we are seeg changes, that those changes have impacts\non ecosystems, on resources  that we are dependent on\nthose systems for our existence. And so, aga, if they change so\ndramatically it is gog to impact us  potentially, if we're not able\nto adapt, we will no longer survive. Pilar is seekg help to defy the extreme\nweather. Her potatoes are her livelihood. Now she’s lost not only a\nlarge part  the harvest, but has too few seed tubers\nfor plantg next year. A seed bank helps\nfarmers like Pilar 53 domestic potato varieties\ngrow on the fields here.  seed bank gives\nPilar tubers. In return she will have to give\nup some  her next harvest. A farmg cooperative collects \nstores seeds from local crops. That way local growers can obta seeds if\nneed be — so when the next drought hits, they’re less likely to have to\ngive up their farms  leave. In some villages here, half the\npopulation has already gone to the US. ‘Vecos fantasmas‘\n ghost neighbors — is what the owners  these\nunoccupied houses are called. y live  the US but send money home to\nbuild their Americanstyle dreamhouses. For when\nthey return.  cemetery  Todos Santos Cuchumatán\nalso has tales  migration to tell. American flags decorate the graves \nthose who died as immigrants  the US When her husb left three years ago, he\n Pilar made that decision together. y knew they would not see\neach other for many years. I know that he's far from home\n we’re a long distance apart. But I also know that we did it\nbecause thgs are very hard here. And I know  my heart that this\ndistance will not ru our relationship. I know my husb\nwill come back. Scientists agree that climate\nchange can no longer be stopped. But its magnitude\nwill depend on whether people are prepared to\nradically alter their lifestyles. As I drive myself,  I see all the\ncars that are gog back  forth  three lanes  traffic,\nfour lanes  traffic. And I thk as a person that's aware\n the climate crisis  you thk ‘oh is there any progress beg\nmade’  all I have to do is go out on the ma\navenues  thk no. I don't know, if I turn\non the television, I don't know how many times\nI'm told to buy a car. You know on one h\nthere's a climate crisis. On the other h I'm always been told to\nbuy the new car, a new car, a new car. I mean, as you look around the\nworld, it's all addg up.  stresses put upon\npeople are worse  worse. I thk what the world\nneeds to be lookg at is we're gog to have\npeople on the move. This is there is somethg set \nmotion that cannot be stopped. re are gog to be places\nthat can no longer be lived . And now this idea  a more bordered\nworld is an idea  exclusion where certa people have\naccess  others do not. And we have to stead\nstart thkg  a world where there's gog to be a lot \npeople on the move,  how can we beg to underst that \nmaybe beg to at least forge a sort  new world where those\npeople will be more welcomed.

48,0.0,"A tranquil forest  the Eifel\nregion  western Germany ... a forest that\nharbors a dark past, ... with a legacy still\nvisible  isolated places ... from a time when it\nwas dubbed a “Green hell”. In the closg stages \nthe Second  War, it was the scene  bloody fightg\nbetween US  German forces.  path to the western lies’\nadvance from Belgium to Germany led straight through the forest\naround the village  Hürtgen. For local people, the battle is\nstill a key part  their history. I really came to contact with\nthe history  the Hürtgen forest when I rode around here\non my bike as a teenager. I’d suddenly come across rus\namong the trees — massive concrete walls. When I asked my parents, they told\nme they were the remas  bunkers from the Second\n War. And once you know what to\nlook for  this wartime lscape, you can also see bomb\ncraters, trenches  foxholes. If you really take the time, you can\nfd a lot  these  War Two relics  the\nHürtgen forest. For around five months the\nforest was the scene  successive, bitterly fought battles between\nthe American  German armies. though the Americans had more\ntroops  were better equipped, their attempt to drive the Germans\nout  the forest was a military disaster. Progress was slow  costly as they became\nbogged down  the treacherous terra. It was a nightmare. I don’t thk\nthere can be a worse hell. It was awful. It was freezg,  these damn\nshells, they hit the top  the tree  came down \nthouss  fragments. y could\nkill anybody. I was  combat there for ten\ndays, at the height  the battle. I was tremblg for\npractically the entire ten days. I knew I could die, \ncourse,  I was terrified. An estimated 25,000 American \nGerman soldiers died  the forest. To survive Hurtgen Forest was a miracle.\nBut here I am. I don\'t know how I survived.  forest was a death\ntrap for the US troops. y called it “Hürtgen Forest” after the small\nvillage that was at the heart  the fightg.  Battle  the Hürtgenwald was\none  the longest  deadliest battles on German\nsoil  the West. It left a lot  scars, not only on the\nhabitants  their descendants, but also on the lscape itself, \nthe forest  also on local buildgs. For the German troops, the\nwar was  effect already long lost. Even the young soldiers — those who\ncould reflect  did not believe  victory. You just wanted to survive,\nto come home safe  sound. Nazi war propaga, however,\nportrayed a completely different picture: By then everyone knew\nthe lies would w the war. Everythg that happened\n the Hürtgenwald meant just a mimal\ndelay  the evitable. And it directly contributed to\nthe contuation  the murders  the concentration  extermation\ncamps   the prisons  other places, until the very last\nsecond  the Third Reich. Sce DDay  June 19,\nthe Western lied troops had been advancg from Normy through\nFrance  Belgium towards Germany ... ...  the process liberatg Paris,\nBrussels  Antwerp from Nazi occupation. We were told\nto, or ordered to, take the ground that they were\non  take it away from them,  that’s how we\nadvanced to w the war. We’re the ones that\ngonna w, not them. On September\n11, 19, the first US divisions reached the\nBelgianGerman border near Aachen ... ... more than 3 months\nearlier than expected. One day later, the 3rd US Armored Division\ncrossed to Germany near the town  Roetgen. We just went through the\ntown,  went on the other side. n we got to the real trouble\nwith the first sight  the Siegfried Le.  Siegfried Le was the defensive wall\nbuilt to secure Germany’s western border. We saw steel gates on the\nroad  Dragon\'s Teeth. And that was the first Dragon\'s\nTeeth that we had seen. Antitank obstacles known as “dragon\'s\nteeth” accompanied a le  bunkers stretchg over 600 kilometers from\nthe Dutch border down to Switzerl. For western lied troops,\na formidable obstacle. y had no precise idea what\nto expect at the Siegfried Le. So the closer they got to the\nactual territory  the Third Reich, the more secure they became,\nbecause they thought they would still face strongly fortified  heavily\nmanned defensive positions.  lies had been taken  by the\nNazi propaga  the prewar years. This went so far that the\nAmerican military’s films, used excerpts from\nGerman propaga films showg the Siegfried Le\nas an surmountable obstacle. to expla to its troops\nwhat they were up agast. As many as half a million men\nworked as much as 20 hours a day to build 22,000 fortified\npositions on l. We knew that the Germans\nhad built the Siegfried Le  that they were hopg that that\nwould stop us, but it didn\'t happen. Because we broke\nthrough the Siegfried Le, we took a hell  a lot \ncasualties, but we did it. But we knew that the Siegfried\nLe was a bad place to go to. Psychologically, the Siegfried\nLe was effective on both sides, but its military value  the\nactual fightg was very limited. US troops succeeded  breakg through\nthe antitank barriers near Roetgen. But on the other side they met with\nstubborn resistance from German troops who were firmly dug   \nthe bunkers   the woods. James Cullen was wounded \nthe fightg near the village  Rott. Oh (expletive)! I got hit. I got hit.\nAnd, it was a tremendous blow. And I looked down  I saw the blood\npourg out right where my heart was. And I said: God, am I I gonna\ndie here on a lousy German field? Because it\nlooked deadly. A few weeks later, Cullen’s\nparents back home received the news that their son had been wounded\n action after beg hit by shrapnel. He was away from\nactive duty for two months. With American troops progressg\nmuch faster than expected, supply les were stretched, which \nparticular meant fuel shortages for tanks.  advance ground to a halt\njust behd the German border. That gave German forces time\nto rebuild their les  defense. Until then, the Wehrmacht had only stationed\nisolated units  the northern Eifel. Meanwhile, preparations were underway\nfor the “Volkssturm” — old men  boys, the “home guard” for\nGermany’s lastditch defense. In a televised\naddress, propaga mister Josef Goebbels\ncalled on his compatriots’ determation. As usual Goebbels\nwas lyg,  course. He claimed that the enemy was not\nyet on German soil, although they were,  tried to mobilize\nany remag forces. It has to be said that the German population\nwere all too happy to go along with that. y were tired  war\n wanted it to be over. But they were also terrified  what\nthe lies would do to them if they came.  Americans wanted to advance further\nto Germany  fally see the war ended. ir aim was to reach the Rhe\n then the Ruhr dustrial region. But ahead  them lay a dense forest,\nalmost 10km wide, which blocked their path: \nHürtgenwald. In local villages, the war had been\nall too present for several months, especially due to the lied\nair raids on cities like Aachen.  civilians sought\nrefuge  airraid shelters. re were constant air raid alerts,\n one day we came out  the bunker  six buildgs had\nburned down  the night.  cattle were screamg, the pigs\nwere screamg, the people were screamg. It was\nawful. In September\n19, the villages were evacuated as the vadg\ntroops  the front le came ever closer. One morng our parents\nsaid: We have to leave.  artillery shells\nwere lg all around. We were the last\nones left  Harscheidt. My parents said: This is too\nmuch, we’re gog to leavse too. Instead  gog around\nthe forest to the north, the American commers decided to\nadvance eastward right through the middle, where they hoped German\ndefenses would be weak. But they completely misjudged the\nterra — with disastrous consequences. A first push  October\n19 ended after just 3km. It\'s not as if forests\nare alien to Americans. It\'s always highly problematic for\nan army to fight  wooded terra. Tanks can\'t just drive through\nforests  over large trees. First you have to cut\npaths through them.  ground was also\nlittered with l mes,  the Americans ran to a\ncha  bunkers  the forest. This was where the Germans\nhad dug themselves .  Americans managed to\ndestroy some  the bunkers ... But after ten days, the losses\non both sides were so great that the fightg\ndied down for a while. Shortly afterwards, American forces further\nnorth achieved a decisive breakthrough, takg Aachen on October\n21st after fierce fightg. It was the first German\ncity to fall to lied hs. But this was  little help to the American\nsoldiers  the nearby Hürtgenwald. As the autumn ras began, the weather\nwas worseng from one day to the next.  US troops were\nliterally bogged down. Plans for a second advance\nhad to be repeatedly delayed. As one GI\nlater said: Anyone who says he knows\nwhere he’d been  the forest is lyg... On November 2, the Americans\nattacked the village  Vossenack, from there they took the villages \nKommerscheidt  Schmidt via the Kall valley. But once aga they\nunderestimated the difficult terra. Some  the hills they had\nto cross were 150m high. When you reach\nthe top  a hill, you immediately experience the\nphenomenon  lookg over the lscape, from one plateau\nto another. But you have no idea how deep\n steep the valleys between are.  28th US Infantry Division reached\nthe village  Schmidt relatively quickly. But then its supply\nles were terrupted. If you look at Vossenack \nSchmidt, with the valley  between, the only lk between them is a\nfootpath that wds down to the valley  then up aga\non the other side.  Americans thought this path would\nbe easy enough to drive  walk along,  that they’d be able to move\nthe necessary troops, vehicles, heavy weapons \nother supplies along it. Everythg. But\nthat was nonsense.  remas  tank\ntracks are a stark remder that the battle for Vossenack  Schmidt\nended  disaster for the Americans.  vaders retreated  panic, only for\nGerman units to cut them f  the valley. Tanks crashed down the slopes \nmany soldiers collapsed from exhaustion.  battle \nthe Kall Valley, which the Americans subsequently\nreferred to as Death Valley, claimed countless\nlives on both sides. A few days after the defeat, General Dwight\nD. Eisenhower came to the Hürtgenwald to meet his troops on the\nground  assess the situation. Neither the lied Supreme\nCommer, nor his ficers, had expected so\nmany casualties.  mood was\ndespondent. Autumn 19 remaed unusually wet  cold,\nthe terra became more impassable every day.  Americans\' hopes for\na quick victory were fadg. y had already spent two\nmonths  the Hürtgenwald, the forest they had hoped\nto cross  just a few days. In midNovember 19, the\nAmericans launched a third fensive. This time they tried to\nadvance by gog further north, passg through the villages  Klehau\n Großhau,  then headg east. A 22yearold ItalianAmerican from\nPennsylvania arrived  the Hürtgenwald. In his youth he’d hoped\nto become a photographer. We were there, I would say a\nmonth. A month  war is a long time.  German artillery was ... it just\nnever stopped. y really bombed us.  days followed the same pattern. It began\nwith heavy artillery fire from the Americans ... n tanks were deployed, Sherman\ntanks, which advanced on a broad front. And then  course you could\nhear the shells  mache guns. That was the actual\nmoment you realized there were other people\nnearby who were shootg at you. Paul Verbeek was sent to the Hürtgenwald\nwith other young recruits  midDecember to lay antitank\nmes.  US forces were constantly\ngettg reforced with more men,  more vehicles\n equipment. But they were not prepared for the\nextreme weather conditions  the Eifel. Whenever they got stuck\n the forest, they dug . But foxholes fered little\nprotection agast the German artillery  the cold\nonset  wter. It would ra sometime,\nor the snow would melt,  the fox hole was\nalways filled with water. I was fortunate to have this camera\nwith me. And if you look at my pictures: I have hundreds \nhundreds  pictures  ficers. I didn\'t take those because I liked\nit, I took them to make them happy, so that they would give me freedom\nto take more pictures, you know. I tricked all  them, I\nused them like little boys. Both the Germans  the\nAmericans spent most  their nights  their foxholes\n the woods, poorly protected from the cold \nwet with makeshift tarpaul shelters. I transformed the nature\naround me to a dark room. I would ask three  my best friends to\nlet me use the metal part  the helmet  those became the trays\nfor my darkroom at night. I would mix my chemicals,\nmost GIs were all asleep, I was workg because the\ndark room was only the night, the earth was the\ndark room, you see. Tony Vaccaro took hundreds\n photos  the Hürtgenwald, although he waited over 50 years\nbefore publishg a selection  them. l I wanted to take was take\nphotographs, photographs, photographs. And that\'s why I am here today, otherwise\nI would have gotten killed a long time ago. Some  the fiercest fightg took\nplace  a valley west  Klehau,  the heart\n the forest. In midNovember, author Ernest Hemgway\nwas witness to the bloody battles there. In his novel “Across the River  to the\nTrees”, based on his experiences, he wrote: “It was a place where it was extremely\ndifficult for a man to stay alive, even if all he did\nwas be there.“ In December, Tony Vaccaro also photographed\nhis comrades preparg for Christmas season. Gift parcels with canned food from home\narrived for soldiers long sce perished. y began to give this food  those\nGIs to the local people, to the Germans. On December 16, 19, a hundred\nmiles further south  the Ardennes, the Germans launched\na fal surprise fensive. Once aga the lies were hardpressed\n this likewise heavily forested region,  had to brg  reforcements at\nshort notice to stem the German advance — many from the\nHürtgenwald. Even durg the Battle  the\nBulge there was fightg here, but both the Wehrmacht  the lies were\nso busy with the fensive further south that there was a period  two or\nthree weeks without any major combat. n the war returned\nto Hürtgenwald. In the course\n January 195, the Americans managed to advance \nthe face  weakeng German resistance.  defeat  the Ardennes counterfensive\nhad cost the defenders their last reserves. I particularly remember the first time I\nsaw the Americans as prisoners  war, I was amazed at how\nwell fed they were. And they were clean \ntidy, cludg their uniforms, while we were a\nliceridden, dirty rabble. Once the Americans reached the Rur —\nnot to be confused with the more famous, similarsoundg\nvalley further north — their way to the Rhe \nCologne was fally clear.  Germans tried to blow up the dams to\nflood the valley  halt the US advance. But by now the end  the war\nseemed to be fast approachg. In February 195, US troops liberated\nSoviet prisoners  war  forced laborers  the Arnoldsweiler\nconcentration camp near Düren. Many were also held  human conditions\nat a second camp near Hürtgenwald. Over 2,000 mates were later buried\nat the Soviet war cemetery  Simmerath. Most  them had died \nhunger  maltreatment. Most  the towns \nvillages  the Hürtgenwald were barely recognizable\nafter the fightg.  lied troops pushed on,  with\na few weeks had conquered the Rhel  the dustrial Ruhr Valley\nas they advanced towards Berl.  evacuated residents now hoped\nto be able to return to their villages. When the Americans passed through,\none  them asked us where we were from. We said we were\nfrom Schmidt. He said he had fought there,\n that we shouldn\'t go back there because the whole place was \nrus  the village had been med. But we said:\n""We\'re gog home.”  fightg  the\nHürtgen Forest was over. But the war had left\na trail  destruction: a ravaged lscape whose\nscars are still clearly visible today. First, American soldiers cleared the\nmes that were buried everywhere. German prisoners  war\nwere also forced to help them. But they could only remove only a\nsmall number  the deadly devices. Aga  aga we’d hear this huge bang,\n another person flew through the air. So many people\nlost their lives. One little girl had been playg with a h\ngrenade. She thought it had perfume side.  h grenades had rgs on\nthem,  when you pulled them, you had to throw\nthem away quickly.  girl’s h\nwas blown f. A very central aspect  the postwar\nexperiences  people livg  the Eifel was that they actually had to rebuild\ntheir lives on a former battlefield. Children died because\nthey played with munitions. It was dangerous to plough\n cultivate the fields. It took decades to clear the most severely\naffected parts  the forest  ordnance, debris  the dead\nwho had been left there. It would take the forest\ndecades to recover. At the same time, nearby towns\nhad been destroyed by air raids. In September 195, August\nScholl returned home from the war. After beg demobbed, me\n another guy arrived  Düren on a freight tra from Bonn\nat the begng  September. We looked at each other  I\nsaid: “Mart, is this actually Düren?” “Sure,” he said,\n“there’s the signpost!” It was a bit lopsided,\nbut it said “Düren”. And then we looked across the\nold town, it was one big pile  rubble. You couldn\'t see a sgle\nbuildg still stg,  the really depressg\nthg was this eerie silence. He contued to his home\nvillage  Großhau on foot. It had been almost completely\ndestroyed durg the fightg.  locals resorted to scavengg\namongst the wrecked American tanks.  Americans had left\nbehd lots  canned food. Canned corned beef was\none  the ma meats. re were also soups  other kds\n meat, but these ts  corned beef were big enough to make a\nhuge pot  soup for a large family. So temporarily, they helped us\nto get more or less enough to eat. In the first summer\nafter the war, large parts  the woods that had survived\nthe fightg would suddenly catch fire. Durg the fightg, the Americans\nhad used phosphorus  their ammunition, which ignited very\neasily  the heat.  locals repeatedly found the\nbodies  dead soldiers  the forest. Some I\nburied myself. And I don\'t need to expla what\nhalfrotten dead people look like. You have to take a deep breath — mentally,\ntoo — when you do somethg like that.  first war cemetery  the area was built\n Vossenack several years after the war. Many  the dead were recovered by\nformer Germany army capta Julius Erasmus, who dedicated the rest  his life to\nsearchg the forest for fallen soldiers.  war cemetery  Vossenack became the last\nrestg place for around 2,300 dead soldiers,  a meetg place for veterans\n relatives  the German fallen. Another war cemetery was set up a few\nkm away  neighborg Hürtgen  1952. Nearly 3,000 soldiers are buried\nthere, many  them  unmarked graves. Sce the Americans didn\'t want soldiers\nburied  Germany, the former enemy, many were laid to rest  the\nNetherls, Luxembourg or Belgium — at the military cemetery \nHenriChapelle, for example. It was not until four\ndecades after the battle that the first groups  American\nveterans returned to the Hürtgenwald  to the place where they\nhad fought as young men. You can underst why it became the\nmurky  as they call it  Hürtgen Forest.  whole battle itself, like the\nman said this morng, it was futile, it was foolish, but the fact remas\nthat it was done to satisfy the whims  a few superior ficers\nthat thought it had to be done. Well, I didn\'t\nenjoy it at the time. I don\'t md beg here now because\nnone  you fellows are wearg uniforms. So it\'s ok as far as that\'s\nconcerned. But it was pretty difficult.  commemorative events sometimes brought\ntogether American  German veterans: former\nenemies.  battle also left its\nlegacy  the forest itself. Over the\nsubsequent years, bomb disposal experts have frequently\nbeen called  to remove bombs, h grenades\n other ordnance.  dangers here will contue to affect\nfuture generations  people  the region. Even now, 75\nyears after the battle, the war is still present  the\nground  the Hurtgen Forest. This is an area that has\nobviously not been searched, like so many areas\n the Hürtgenwald. Here you might still unearth a\ngrenade by scratchg away the topsoil. Sometimes these thgs\ndon\'t look like munitions at all. For example, there’s a German grenade that\nlooks like a cigar, it’s about the same size. But if it goes f,\nyou’re gone. In the first decades\nafter the war, hundreds  tons  ordnance\nwere found  the forest every year. This footage from 198 shows the\nyield  a search lastg two weeks. You have to image that here, by\nnoon  a sgle day,  a sgle attack, the Americans fired\nabout 12,000 grenades. 12,000 — not 1,200. Given the typical\nassumption that 15%  these are duds, then we have to assume there are about\n1,500 duds  an area  3.5 hectares. For a number\n years now, researchers have been studyg the Hürtgenwald\nusg the latest scientific methods. y’ve been able to\nreconstruct the course  the battle  places where this\nwasn’t previously possible. When you walk\nthrough the woods here, you encounter signs \nthe battle at every turn. In all the open spaces, however, the former\nbattlefield has been completely cleared. In other words, we always see half \nthe battlefield. And we can see that here. We are stg  what appears\nto be a completely level green field, with nothg to dicate that\nwe’re on a former battlefield. But  fact, we’re  the middle\n a highly fortified section  the Germans’\nsecond le  defense. Many local people have kept\nthe memory  the battle alive. In addition to\nthe German dead, thouss  Americans who had been sent\nto Europe to end Nazi terror perished here. though this is by no\nmeans clear everywhere. Take the memorial stones for American\nor German soldiers, for example.  way they are treated on equal\nterms is actually quite questionable. It ought to be made clear that\nthe Americans were fightg for somethg very different\nthan the German soldiers. But you’ll fd them dotted around\nthe lscape without any comment.  forest is still frequented by people\nforagg around for relics  the battle. Even today the area is a popular\nsite among war enthusiasts. But many locals are annoyed by these\ngroups  dividuals  American uniforms, repeatedly reenactg\nscenes from the battle. It\'s kd  like replayg the war.\nSome people even dig new trenches here. So they don\'t leave this\ncommemorative lscape as it was. Of course, they don\'t shoot at\neach other with live ammunition, but people still\nfd it fascatg. I take a critical view, because\nthere were so many fatalities here. Whether it\'s fun or\nnot is beside the pot. Today there are now signs for\nwalkers  hikers  various places, tellg the story  the\nBattle  the Hürtgen Forest. y also remd us  its\nimportance for the Western allies\' advance through Germany. But the Hürtgenwald will probably\nnever be a normal forest aga. Certaly not now, some\n75 years after the battle. I went back to Hurtgen\nForest maybe ten years ago. I cried like a baby because I\nsuddenly remembered my best friends that got killed \nthe Hurtgen Forest. It was ugly, ugly for\nmankd to have wars.  trouble mankd makes is he thks\nhe\'s Italian, he\'s German, he\'s Spanish. We\'re all humans on this beautiful,\nparadise that is our earth. Beautiful!"

blotchy [] twenty years after this encounter she rgs the bell aga hello my name is Amelia I used to live here I wanted to see who lives here today  if we could look around if that's okay how do you want to look around we'd like to come  we bought the house 10 years ago we lived up there  because we didn't want to pay rent anymore we bought it back Wilson were adopted that's what my parents thought at the time  they were tenants but  1990 they bought the plot my sister was born  the livg room here she lives  Turkey now the woman doesn't know the previous occupier the man who threatened Emily's father with a gun she doesn't want to talk about the war years either it's best to forget she says but she acquired the house legally although they did get fancial compensation her parents still haven't got over the loss  their house people say they've dealt with a lot  the past but when probed even a Millau shows they haven't really forgotten [] [] amel is waitg for her husb Adam [] [] Emily's parents wanted her to marry a Muslim  they were happy with Adam [] Adam is an imam  travnik he prays five times a day it's his job the two have been married for seven years Faris was born five years ago somewhere it was obvious to my parents that I'd marry a Muslim I can't say I was happy or unhappy it was just taken for granted it was also clear to me that I'd marry a Muslim his father  grfather were amounts to [] Thursday's market day  travnik but amela rarely manages to shop here she has to work six days a week the average wage  Bosnia is 00 euros a month but few people  travnik earn that much she says amela says we should visit the military cemetery behd the market while she does her shoppg [] the headstones there all tell the same story the dead were all  their midtwenties when they died four hundred  seventy eight  them are buried  this cemetery alone war veterans meet here regularly this is neverold  smudge he's a 1 year old Muslim who lost almost all  his friends  the war he was just 16 when he joed the Bosnia forces we were still untouched somewhat with our neighbors durg the war we met up when there was no fightg we drank cfee  then we all picked up our guns  took sides aga the war wasn't about ordary people it was for the politicians this Muslim man married a Serbian Orthodox woman shortly after the war much to the annoyance  his fatherlaw who fought on the Serb side he shot at me I shot at him  that doesn't mean I have to hate it I don't hate anybody but when the time comes such a man pots a gun at you the time comes when you have to pot one back at him  kill him normal people can't image that until they're  that situation themselves to them seriously we visit Mvula d at home he lives just a few mutes from the cemetery together with his wife  their sevenyearold daughter [] meperide has no contact with his serbian fatherlaw he's only ever seen him once when he picked up his wife there's been radio silence ever sce [] before the war mixed families were normal there weren't any straights that didn't have at least one mixed couple we never paid attention to that  Bosnia back then I couldn't tell Croatian  Serbian names apart the war may be  the past but it's still a big problem for mixed couples they still fear they could have to choose sides if a conflict between the ethnic groups flares up aga we're back with a mullah outside her school she believes that Bosnia could become one country even if the ethnic groups don't termarry we like to say unity  diversity we have our differences  we have to tolerate them what about the students  the school today it's eveng we've agreed to meet Gabriella  alia all the students go to the same bars  clubs they all know each other but do they ever fall  love or even marry back at the school Gabriela  alia had already said it was normal for every ethnic group to have his own view  history  the eveng they tell us how difficult it can become when friendships become more serious I have a friend she's Catholic she's been with a Muslim for 8 months but they have to hide because  their families it's not about whether they love each other but about what people will say that's the biggest problem  bosniaherzegova  i thk that will contue for many years boys jo the girls it's a normal eveng this cafe doesn't serve alcohol because it's maly frequented by Muslims if you spend a bit  time here you get to recognize each other you know right away who's what ethnicity  who's what faith that's why it's unlikely you'll fall  love with someone  a different one if that happens you'll risk losg your family's trust over a boy never md how strong your feelgs are you have your family that's how we were raised we tell them that we can be friends but nothg more anyway after an eveng  the bar word would have got round among the families it's the Sunday service  the village  Gooch Agora which is largely habited by Bosnian Croats [] this is the way Gabriela wants to preserve her Bosnia she tends to stay with her own  avoid any romantic entanglements with Muslims which is exactly what her mother wants to [] Oh when we look back at the old Yugoslavia the state's goal was to tegrate the Christian Muslim  Serbian communities they wanted to create a nation  Yugoslavia jected it a divided school  a divided country what does the future hold for amylase son Ferris will his parents tell him who he can marry what if your son wanted to marry a Catholic you won sir I wouldn't allow it our faith says she has to be a Muslim a Mela there's no be wonderg if they wanted to meet up  go out I wouldn't md but if they wanted to get married I wouldn't want that he shouldn't marry someone with different values to us he could have a lot  problems  his marriage I see that all the time would the child be baptized I want my child to get married  I want grchildren one day there would be a lot  conflict at the very latest over the baptism question I don't want him growg up with problems like that the school fence bothers amela moohyun ovitch but the wolves live on  private lives  the war changed people who knows if love will ever transcend Bosnia's ethnic divisions [] you
51,0.0,"this is a country where the war never ended [] every morng at exactly 6:00 a.m. loudspeakers across North Korea sound a morng wakeup call featurg the same melody every day a melody familiar from a revolutionary opera it tells the story  a young nurse at the front who has dedicated her life to the party  is searchg for the beloved general who summons her to show him the way this is a country at war agast the border that divides it [] [] I was always at the top  my class the teachers all rated me lightly even at school there was a hierarchy among the pupils at the top you always had the class representatives  the political representatives  I always held both positions I've seen big good together back home that's how I learned to give orders  how to lead people at the border between the two koreas / a cold war time ststill with no peace agreement ever signed the war has been suspended sce hostilities ceased  1953  the course  the next six decades the North secretly developed a weapon that the world's major powers believed only they had the secret to the nuclear bomb how is a country considered one  the poorest on the planet  which is also shunned by most other nations able to afford such weaponry [] only those who were part  the system are privy to the secret it took years to track them down those who we were able to ask had a tragic tale to tell  men  women who were tasked with earng money for their country whatever the price the money  the dictators men soul just fifty kilometers away from the border to North Korea  the space  just 20 years the South Korean capital became the fourth richest city on the planet after Tokyo New York  Los Angeles this is where the ordeal ends for many  the refugees from North Korea this young highrankg ficial from the North traveled thouss  kilometers on a trek across  all the way to Seoul he's been livg here with a new identity for two years today he calls himself Michael Kim he's 28 years old  works parttime as a museum attendant this is an exhibition organised by the Seoul authorities it shows a model apartment  North Korea to illustrate what life looks like for the residents  Pyongyang havg actually lived there myself I've been asked to expla  further detail what's her name rhymes oh boy I began my career  the State Security Agency the CIA  North Korea I worked  the fancial department where I came to attention due to my expertise I was transferred to fice 39 that was unusual I was only 25 when I joed I was the youngest member  staff their fice 39 manages  directs all the economic activities  thouss  firms  factories the fice was set up to earn money for the regime outside the country half  North Korea's gross domestic product comes from fice 39 saravana times question I'm now with me [] Michael fled from one day to the next without warng his family he knew too much to be able to keep on believg  the regime he decided to meet us three weeks ago he sisted on showg his face while beg terviewed  the hope  becomg too well known to be secretly assassated reports from men who have been volved  fice 39 the Guardians  North Korea's many fancial secrets are extremely rare there have been precious few defectors fleeg the country means puttg yourself  danger as well as family members left behd limb ill on the other h was right at the bottom  the hierarchy upon who was sent halfway around the world to work on a construction site  the desert  Kuwait for me it wasn't about whether I wanted to do it time was runng out I wanted to leave quickly so that we could get somethg to eat our leader Kim ilsung died  July 199  startg a year later  May 1995 the state was no longer able to provide the normal food rations people started to panic this was the first time they had reduced the rations I had a two year old daughter over there  order to leave you had to be married  have children if you don't have any children they won't let you out I thought family  four or five can live for at least six months on my salary  over $120 a month if I send it to Pyongyang after two months we asked why we weren't gettg paid they said they had not been structed by the party to pay our salary the party  North Korea was Kim jongil our commer  chief that answer silenced us hundreds  workers had to keep their mouths shut we kept on workg at night to usg our flashlights we'd fight f sleep  just carry on I kept workg like that for five months  all that time I didn't get paid I thought she did [] sendg workers abroad was an idea first troduced  197 a gigantic network  cleste companies  fancial constructs gradually evolved all  them with one sole goal earng money for fice 39 this man was likewise born  the North  Pyongyang  the early 2000s he was sent to Sgapore he earned tens  millions  dollars for North Korea as a representative  Pyongyang's Northeast Asia Bank  2003 he was suspected  havg passed on formation about the regime's fances he fled to South Korea today the former banker works for his new country's telligence agencies he supports them  their struggle agast the regime he once swore eternal allegiance to our ma goal is to make foreign cash  this foreign cash busess is secret complete the secret fice namitha ne teams rema created there the system is set up like this all North Korean stitutions where this foreign cash is generated they are obliged to report it to Kim to the top  then should brg that should pay that  cash Kim family mounta zone  before Kim jongil so together or this  then spend it accordg to his priorities so through economies one is Kim family economy  the other one is the national economy run by the cabet  run by their so called  a central planng so tuned family I called it you know royal court economy royal court economy they possess all the best pritable busesses best hotels there's department stores you know those services restaurants they are makg money foreign key  then it also goes to give Antonio mountas  home so separate economy the money that you make will never go to the central economy no central bank fance mistry  trade bank they can never what poke their nose to our busesses you know they can never they can not ask anythg Jim gathered or  then reallocator so let's say a billion US dollar a year she get that cash  cash  then she used that now nuclear  missile program is you know consumes a lot  money so is from Jim Jones pocket there are different workers you know at most one hundred  fifty thous fifty thous  Russia  little more    others  scattered around the world so one hundred  fifty thous  they make a lot  money usually so 70 percentage or 80 percentage  the salary are cut  sent through the state  the party so if they make all  them make $100 then the amount is how much Shiva money on a peg put  your own parish man 15 million 15 million a month they don't make only one hundred US bucks a year iö month then they make more maybe several hundred is that least so a lot  money is gog to control the volume  their cash come Kim Jong Un's fund creased dramatically  the past  the past 20 years  the past 20 years so he can buy more  she can do contue this  a nuclear  missile program you couldn't even get my turtle generally especially  places where we have a special agreement  places like Eastern Europe Southeast Asia Africa we have workers everywhere  Pol the Ukrae Uzbekistan Mongolia Viki Stan Longhorn while traditional yurt dwellgs dot the modern cityscape the noise from the pneumatic hammers is omnipresent every day the concrete expanses contue to spread a little more  the Mongolian capital ulaanbataar for a period  over 70 years the country had a communist regime the city's gr monuments honorg the Eastern Bloc or a legacy  that era but after the collapse  the Soviet Union Mongolia switched to the Western capitalist camp people left rural regions  droves for the city's ulaan bataar is  urgent need  new housg but lacks sufficient manpower to build it the government has therefore been hirg workers from  Vietnam  North Korea for reforcements the work is assigned the same way  each construction site the Mongolian workers are used for exterior jobs while the better qualified North Koreans for example take care  the terior the workers from Pyongyang are under observation day  night we want to approach them discreetly  first just send our terpreter hello hello the North Koreans workg today sure do they sleep here yes  they never go out just to go shoppg that's all  they even sleep here yes side North Korea goes to extreme lengths to prevent its workers from comg to contact with the outside world  discoverg a reality that is other than the one depicted  the daily propaga they're only allowed to go out  groups so that they can keep an eye on each other but  the narrow market aisles  ol Betar we spot a North Korean worker who appears to be on his own can we talk while we look at the shoes yes when did you come here to Mongolia three years ago that's a long time yes  when are you gog back home soon  a month  have you earned much money no I have not earned a lot  mongolian money  why not aren't you paid I didn't get much not much no I've been workg but I never got any money they must be bad people there's a lot  bad people around really yep do you have family  North Korea how many children's I have one child my wife was pregnant when I left I've never seen my child so three years old three years boy a girl I got a letter sayg it was a boy I'm desperate to go  see my son the workers usually have three year contracts  are not allowed to go home durg that time only very few use their stay abroad to defect due to their families still livg  North Korea they are all too aware that they would never see them aga is Mongolia coverg up the presence  these workers with its borders neither the government nor the companies employg them were prepared to talk to us but allegedly there are 1,200 North Koreans  the country they are there legally at the vitation  the Mongolian government the companies transfer the salaries directly to the North Korean embassy  ulaanbataar from where the money is then confiscated by the regime  Pyongyang a fraction  the Sun a few dozen euros a month at most is paid to the workers who use it to support their families  North Korea [] the construction workers are not the only moneymakers for the regime it also dispatches loggers to the forests  Siberia peasants to farms Pyongyang even exports doctors the regime's most lucrative source  come acupuncturists  chiropractors are sent abroad to open practices there what they earn however goes to the regime back home  lah  Betar there are three  them we'd like to terview North Korean workers can we speak with you your nose Korean are you guys nuts corier yes can we ask you a question we want to know why you guys are  Mongolia what do you do here for how long you've been here the doctors are not allowed to talk without permission from the embassy [] North Korea reportedly generates 50 million euros a year from remittances earned by its citizens secretly workg abroad no records are kept  these secret funds  accounts documentation could potentially be used as evidence receipts bank transfers  ternal notes are systematically destroyed on the orders  the Kim family this enables the regime to deny their existence  front  the ternational community but above all to the starvg population back home they are not to get wd  the millions the Kim family earns at their expense I was a worker too I didn't get anythg for six or eight months I worked myself to the bone so I reckoned why not help myself this man spent many years  Siberia prior to his defection he worked his way up to management level feelg remorse he wanted to break his years  silence  the hope that his testimony could help other former foreign workers who are still prisoners  the system the people positioned above the workers siphon f huge sums  money from those salaries for themselves let's say our bosses l a contract for 10 million they'll tell us that it's 7 million  we tell our foremen that it's even lower maybe 5 million so even then we're still able to transfer our matory share to the regime another trick is to negotiate 50 men for a job then we arrange to use only 20  we send the rest elsewhere that means we can put aside a pile  money for ourselves  a good month how much did you earn around 20,000 dollars  one month yes do you know how much fice 39 earns per year  how much  that goes to developg missiles nobody knows that that's the most strictly guarded secret  all nobody  fice 39 can say neither the amount for the fice workers nor the costs for their workers or any other figure if they were to talk about it at all plans to acquire nuclear weapons were first conceived by the regime back  1953 durg the Korean War after the u.s. threatened to deploy its nuclear arsenal agast the country sce comg to power  2011 Kim jongun has launched 85 missiles  conducted four nuclear tests twice as many as his father  grfather combed the test missiles were fired over the Sea  Japan or  the direction  the Pacific with the capability to send nuclear warheads as far as California pyongyang now sists that washgton would never dare to attack North Korea aga on November 29th 2017 North Korea surprised the world with the test launch  an tercontental ballistic missile kim jeonghoon told his people that the country was now a nuclear power  boasted that it could deliver a strike anywhere  the u.s. at the same time a group  eight men  different nationalities convened at the New York headquarters  the United ions where a race agast time began they comprised experts on rocket technology fance aviation  shippg experts some were from the civilian sector others from telligence agencies their work is topsecret their goal to dry up the secret money sources  the Kim family for their own safety no photos exist  this expert committee only Huw Griffiths the group's head sce 201 was willg to talk on camera these rockets that use ballistic missilerelated technology their debris has been recovered by the South Korean navy who've had ships close enough when the wreckage has splashed down  they've recovered it  then they've vited the panel to spect this this debris  once we've spected the debris we note down the serial numbers we take photographs  then  many cases we're able to trace back the logistics  procurement cha so that's the rocker  then we have what's left  that this is one  the arm the Boosters you're seeg here there is a cluster  them round about you want to obscure this well our vestigation show that a percentage  the components used  their rockets  missiles have been sourced abroad these goods will be exported  the first stance to other countries  Asia to busess centers such as Sgapore Hong Kong so that to a large multational company based  say Europe who's

sanctions that became progressively more severe  order to isolate North Korea we waited five months for ficial permission to fly to North Korea the North Korean diplomats didn't want us to film  wter fearg that the power outages might leave a bad impression fally  late March 2018 with temperatures risg aga it happened we were granted permission to travel by tra to North Korea via   the border town

our escorts await us  the capital Pyongyang we're now enterg a world reserved for the privileged section  the population these streets  boulevards serve three million residents ten percent  the population the most loyal supporters  the regime a special permit is required to enter the city our two guides accompany us from dawn until late at night they've been tasked with showg us that Pyongyang despite all the sanctions imposed by the United ions is no longer some economically crippled city with a povertystricken population all thanks to the new national heroes the scientists this architect spent eight years studyg  France after leavg the a colonoscopy for architecture  Paris he returned to North Korea  2010 today he's one  the best architects  the capital designg skyscrapers for the new elite this buildg was constructed  less than a year  just under eight months  that  an economically challengg time for Koreans but they still managed to complete it we want to show that we

esteemed leader personally givg people decorations for Koreans these are the most glorious occasions I was really happy when we moved  here I could only cry  thk about his love the marshal devotes a lot  time to the scientists  they reward him with their dustriousness my husb has been a scientist for 30 years her husb teaches fluid mechanics at the Technical   Kim Jake the apartment they were assigned has 200 square meters  floor space the regime also provides the furniture not everyone  Pyongyang lives  modern highrises like this one but this family is far from an exception every year sce Kim jongun came to power he has built  augurated a new residential district that has volved 50 new residential blocks sproutg up with the space  a few months they're tended for the scientists  their families who have rendered extraordary services for the regime one  these highrises is home to an architect's fice servg Kim jongun excellent work [] but reasons to push up there there's always more work to be done there are always more project we never have enough architects this is  itself a huge buildg site everyone is tied up  at least two or three projects  is workg nonstop but it's still not really enough we do allnighters given the ternational situation  all the sanctions doesn't that hamper construction I don't see how that would have an impact I saw a lot  construction sites  Europe where work was immediately suspended after a crisis but here we carry on workg despite the growg number  projects  the pipele we aren't afraid  anythg we keep on makg progress regardless [] how is North Korea able to fance this construction boom has it been able to shrug f the sanctions out on the streets the stardized socialist dress code has been lent a little more color  the last three years the mood seems almost relaxed  yet the regime still governs its people with an iron fist even the slightest critical gesture or word  disapproval will soon fd someone  one  the country's many camps for political prisoners sce Kim jongun has been  power however there have been signs  a reorientation the orders now are to ensure that the economy evolves at the same pace as the nuclear program [] cut all this to size let's be careful down there you have to cut it straight look this is not straight we built this entire set  ourselves  thanks to these Korean built maches we've been able to automate a number  jobs  also reduce our power consumption as a result we've almost doubled our production capacity everythg here is a jot product  the experts from the Academy    the researchers at Kim ilsung  where does the material for the shoes come from we're unable to import materials due to the strategy  our enemies so we produce everythg ourselves that volves checkg which components we have available so that we can make our own shoes the key factors for this economic revival novation  adaptation the goal is to persevere  prove to the world that the country doesn't need anyone else we have solar panels we have them stalled on practically all factory ros they generate up to 00 kilowatts  electricity our factories need a capacity  only 300 kilowatts that means the electricity generated from the solar panels is easily enough to keep our factory runng despite the sanctions  the isolation the shoe factory is one  a number  model factories that Kim jongun has had built for each sector  Industry they all clude a digital control center with a direct connection to Pyongyang's universities  research centers more model factories are to be set up across the country

Germany has termated the lease but the owners  the hostel have steadfastly refused to vacate the premises do you know whether fice 39 makes money  France or Germany  France or Germany sure there are no workers  those countries because  the strgent laws but one thg they do have is money  wealth North Korea buys  sells real estate for rental or speculative prit if they would do direct busess  those countries  openly show that our company is a North Korean company we'd immediately be subject to a tax on it we rent out apartments nobody knows who the owner is really we just collect the rents do you know the names  these firms if I were to tell you that they'd end up on the sanctions list right away yes North Korea is an awful dictatorship but the people who serve the regime faithfully like me or my friends or even the bosses aren't just dog our job [] perhaps what they do is  itself bad but there's still a code  honor between us do they earn money  the u.s. not that I know  but we do do everythg we can to relieve them  money we have technology hackg that cludes blackmailg stware North Korea hacks to the u.s. frastructure dustry your digital companies we can't analyze or make much use  the data as such we just hack our way   then dem money  return for guaranteeg that we will keep the data to ourselves it's basically North Korea takg digital data as hostage you know stoppg this  a cold the real trade with  coal  iron ore  other stuff you know this is the real sanction so it took only several months but they would cannot stop everythg how can they stop all North Queens you know how many shadow companies  operatives are there how far does their network  extend  what kd  danger do they pose  our fal reports the Security Council we've we've documented North Korean weapons  prohibited military trag programs  dozens  African  Middle Eastern member states  Mozambique the contracts one  the contracts we saw was worth more than six million dollars  Tanzania the contract was worth a similar amount  euros a little more I thk maybe twelve million so it's all about the money part  the problem with ballistic missiles is that the technology wasn't supplied to all the countries that wanted this technology so the the North Koreans stepped   this is very alarmg that  terms  proliferation there was this new killer new killer facility   Syria that was set up with North Korean assistance  this is this is the kd  activity that I know concerns a lot  people  the North Koreans also have a huge stockpile  chemical weapons as well it's been 20 years sce little fled the Kuwaiti desert where he'd been workg on construction sites  the meantime he's become a father aga here  Seoul he has two sons they know they also have a big sister somewhere on the other side  the border you don't worry thk about it the more I wonder what it is that made me who I am if it were a normal regime I would never have run away this mismanage system forced me to make that terrible decision [] once a month  Seoul refugees from the north meet up  a Christian Center  order to remember their families  their people back home almost like orphans  the man who was once their leader they turned to

grades he attended this school himself  is determed to persevere his classroom flooded for the first time  2013 conditions here are very very difficult for us we ten have to send the children home when the classrooms flood the children sit with their legs  water regular struction has become impossible the children are fallg behd with the next five or six years rahmatullah believes the school will be submerged it will be aboned along with the village what will it look like here three decades from now  the year 2050 but at that time there will be the most extreme conditions  the weather forward with our 17,000 Isls a lot  course  that will be eaten up by the sea so life will not be the same as here there's a lot  illnesses there will be plagues  the economic growth  the hook on the whole world will be disturbed by horizontal strife one agast the other because fightg for food water maybe arrows her death will be the very sad picture  2050 for the Indonesian special envoy the catastrophic impact  unchecked climate change is the biggest challenge facg humankd today ten years ago the topic was barely on the radar Jakarta the capital  Indonesia with some 10 million residents it's the largest city  Southeast Asia around 30 million people live  the metropolitan area makg it the second largest urban conglomeration  the world the fish markets are located  North Jakarta the scent  the ocean lies  the air mixg with the odours  the city just a few kilometers from the city center the problems confrontg this tropical metropolis become apparent residents struggle with smog heat heavy traffic pollution population density  poor hygienic conditions  with creasg frequency floodg the slum district  Dutta is located near the airport it's 5,000 residents used to live near the sea but these days it almost looks like they live  it EKOS umano has lived  dot up sce the 1970s he  his neighbors have watched the risg sea level with concern at least once a month the floodg reaches his knees sometimes the water remas two days sometimes a week it flooded here for the first time around the year 2000 first it was just a few centimetres sce 2010 the floodg has been gettg higher  higher but it's never been as bad as it is now  Jakarta the district's closest to the coast faced the biggest problems poor neighborhoods like Dada will be among the first to need complete relocation the slums most atrisk are situated along a wide corridor that snakes through the city says urban planner Marco kusuma vijaya only about the coastal areas the flood actually up streams  the city center  Jakarta Fabian dear from my fice kusuma V Jaya is director  the rujak Center for urban studies which searches for solutions for climate related problems right now their focus is the depletion  groundwater from the area the declg water table has even more serious consequences than risg sea levels it's causg the ground to sk  large parts  the city with it on the way  Jakarta the sea level rises at between  to 6 millimeters per year but was is that the l  Jakarta is subsidg by 3 to 20 centimeters  February 2013 nearly half  Jakarta was underwater scenes like this are likely to become creasgly common ocean levels contue to rise the l is collapsg  heavy ras are becomg more frequent about one third  Jakarta is currently below sea level environmental problems are causg a growg number  people to flee the city but most want to rema or have no other choice  an effort to protect the capital the government has begun buildg a seawall but only six  the planned 50 kilometers have been built  even their water is fdg its way through it's becomg clear that everythg located directly on the water will one day fall victim to it like this mosque the bad thg is actually most  the poor neighborhoods will be flooded because the rich neighborhood have raised themselves you know but exactly because they erase their ground so the water that come to their ground will actually flow to the surroundg poor or neighborhood poor districts located along one  Jakarta's 13 rivers ten stay submerged for weeks when the floodwaters rise areas near the Chile one river are most at risk like this lowcome district by the Chile one tributary Tonk all situated just four hundred meters from the ocean the drivers housekeepers fishermen construction workers  such that live here all face climate change related risks this estimated that 65%  our operation will be directly victimized weather which is a lot  people  his 65 percent  300 million three hundred million is 170 million people will we are an isl nation  around six thous isls are habited because coastal areas will be destroyed Steff they came up with figures  1 million four zero million because they are the coastal people  those are prone to the effects  lslides so about forty million people are directly volved  those volved may have to leave their homes [] Indonesia is prone to a variety  natural disasters from cyclones to mudslides floodg to droughts but there is one place that is at risk  all  these the isl  Java  it's here that one  the world's most densely populated areas is located Jakarta the city's famous traffic jams lasts almost until midnight only to resume aga at dawn more than 3.5 million people commute to the city every day just 100 kilometers southeast the bustle  Jakarta is a distant memory chan your district is situated at the foot  two active volcanoes it's one  Java's most fertile farmg regions the rice vegetables  fruit grown here help feed the country's capital the village  Saranga is accessible only by motorbike or on foot dudu Durrani runs a small cfee plantation here like his father  grfather he is a farmer cfee used to be a safe crop choice it fetched a better price than vegetables  was harder than rice but that's changg when I was younger all farmers would plant durg ray season so January February  March  then everyone would harvest durg dry season but now my colleagues  I are desperate because it's ten dry  the ray season   the dry season it ras we are payg the price for climate change our harvests have dropped massively by about 60% nearly half  local farmers have given up they've moved to other parts  Indonesia or left the country altogether some have become construction workers  Saudi Arabia but doo doo de Roni doesn't want to jo them I can't image dog anythg else I will stay here as long as possible I'm a farmer that's who I am I'm gog to try to somehow adapt to climate change if it's too dry when it's time to plant for example I'll just wait these mountaous regions don't just supply food to the cities their forests also help store rawater but extreme weather conditions are growg creasgly common here  still forests are fallg victim to loggg leavg ra water to flow unhdered to the valley sometimes the water sweeps away everythg  its path [] mudslides have had fatal consequences these images date from 2017  2018 [] [] special climate voice Hockman viitala says that by mid century climate change will have forced 0 million people to flee their homes  Indonesia alone farmers who can no longer till their fields slum dwellers whose ten roed huts have sunk to the sea [] [] most experts agree that it's the world's coldest regions that have become the cauldron for climate change these are the Arctic the Antarctic aska  much  the permafrost  Russia [] [] Nikita Z mph traed as a mathematician but his father Sarah's lifelong commitment spired Nikita to change course now like his father he has dedicated his life to preservg Russia's permafrost he's come to the Kalima River  northeastern Siberia an eighthour flight from Moscow to gather evidence that the permafrost is vanishg the ground has warmed up to 3 degrees Celsius causg the top layer  the ice to melt one side effect is that more  more rare fossils are surfacg for paleontologists this would be a treasure trove a field  riches from the distant Pleistocene epoch mama swag not the biggest one but every size 20 so here was  the position the consistent here was huge  own Everest quake homes around one mammoth  labeled for 0,000 years  all never here on this quake home to now lay around 600 skeletons so every once  a while there all along the Kalima soil is erodg slidg to the river as a consequence  the meltg permafrost Nikita Zima calls plants like these zombies because the soil  which they are growg was Behrend for forty thous years this vegetation will also soon end up  the river the changes takg place here could soon be a reality across wide expanses  Russia  it could also have a dramatic impact on the global climate  mass migration  people's  there is an immense amount  biomass still trapped with the permafrost [] if that trapped co2  methane were to be released to the atmosphere the pace  climate change would crease dramatically so these are roots  grasses which grew here maybe around 0,000 years ago  the problem that is it huge storage  carbon  take all these little groups  put them on the one side  the burns  on the other side  the bones put all the background vegetation  the planet so basically all trees  shrubs  the planet you will see that this ty little roots wait more  if Paris will start to degrade everywhere all this will become a way for microbes to eat  they were very soon convertg to greenhouse gases co2 methane that's ice pure ice out there  you see when this ice is meltg the wood is mixed  with this soil  creatg this mud folks which are children down the slope  the gradations have been very rapidly here so it's a combation  both loads  carbon  lots  ice  that's a give you a very rapid carbon bond so every problem that will be happeng with the global warmg worldwide with this thg will be probably amplified so if it will it will see if it's gog to be bad somewhere to turn very bad so if there is a way to stop that from happeng like we need to apply that because if not you know you can write any apocalyptic scenarios you want  probably most  them will come true [] it's breakfast time  Nikita zoomorphs guesthouse terest  permafrost has soared over the past decade so now the guest rooms here at the station are usually booked yearround with researchers from all over the world this is the group from Oxford  here to study the transformations currently underway  what used to be frozen earth durg the Soviet era this enormous satellite used to broadcast television programmg from Moscow the Z morphs turned the station to a home base for scientists from around the world [] yeah well most though the data that has been collected  Siberia  across Russia's Far East are alarmg normally the vegetation bds greenhouse gases  the summer  only releases very small amounts back to the atmosphere  wter which is but for the past few years the permafrost that's thawg more  more  the summer is releasg evercreasg amounts  methane  co2 durg the wter at the moment the biosphere is actg as a well could be say as a friend as a moderate break on climate change so about 0%  the carbon dioxide we emit is beg absorbed by the biosphere  that's actg to slow down climate change if that wasn't happeng climate change would be even faster than it is but one  the big concerns we have as system scientists is understg how long will the biosphere keep actg as a break  is there a danger that at some time  the future with this break we'll turn to an accelerator scientists from all over are turng their attention to the permafrost  its potential impact on climate change this group  researchers from Prague is beg hosted by the Institute  applied ecology  the North  the   Sakha the researchers have just returned from a crater that is carved to the permafrost these soil samples are a gift to the Institute  return the researchers hope to obta permission to exhibit some  their spectacular fds  a museum at home remas  a mammoth  the mummified remas  an extct horse from the Pleistocene epoch the crater  which the fossilized remas were found was named the bottarga crater but locals call it the Gateway to the underworld it's easy to see why []  the 1960s a small section  forest was cleared to make way for a new road the permafrost origally beneath the trees began erodg at first the hole was just a few meters deep the stood on average the mega crater is between 0  60 metres deep   some places it's 100 meters deep it's 1.5 kilometers long  about one kilometer wide right now but it's hard to determe exactly how wide it is because it's expg so quickly these kds  catastrophic events could become creasgly common  not just  residential areas but anywhere  the wilderness wherever there are pipeles  natural gas facilities our entire frastructure could be impacted most  the cities  Siberia   Russia's Far East could be affected about 25 million people  all how big would the impact be if all the world's permafrost were to melt so far there isn't enough cross regional research to answer that but there are fdgs regardg the polar region from a global terrestrial network for permafrost  1996 the permafrost melted to a depth  5 centimeters  the summer by 2017 it melted to a depth  87 centimeters a nearly 100 percent crease over just 20 years this poses a danger to both people  frastructure natural gas  oil pipeles are particularly affected Greenpeace has estimated that leaks  pipeles cost by thawg soil are leadg to about 1%  oil beg lost that oil some 5 million tons  it each year seeps to the ground the residents  the Arctic city  cesky  the far northeast  Russia are bearg witness to this rapid transformation temperatures are risg exorably asphalt on the streets is begng to buckle  several buildgs are showg signs that the solid ground on which they once stood has begun to sk the city  chair ski on the kolyma river is also home to Nikita Zi Mf even though temperatures drop here to mus 60 degrees Celsius  the wter the erosion  the permafrost soil appears unstoppable this is especially apparent at the former water treatment plant like all the buildgs here it sts on pillars [] the earth began to sk here just two years ago now the crater is already 10 meters deep as soon as it starts it's gog very rough so when I was here a week ago there was some those two place with you  the air  now we came they already come up down  there is a huge niche gog underneath the purpose  where this is this ice it's been eroded  eventually all that slope you'll collapse also so this process kd  grow  them with I know centimeters a day maybe tens  centimeters today with the hot Baker so we have serious buildg the firm fourth area  now with climate gettg warmer temperatures also gettg warmer  with degradation it looks like that so all the frastructure  the next few decades will probably come up elsewhere the heat  the Sun is relentless this is Cameroon  central Africa here  the streambed  the my abullah River signs  despair are everywhere [] the north  Cameroon receives two months  rafall a year at most  August  September durg the rest  the year people must walk far to fd water or dig deep older people who live here say that water used to flow abundantly through the

family fear the worst if their livestock die they will be left with nothg the sprg is six kilometers away we have to fetch water twice a day just to have barely enough for our four cattle the goats  my family don't quibble over the past 1015 years the situation has grown much worse that's why young people aren't able to stay  their villages they're forced to leave to go to the cities there's no future for them here for such a shape as given away by that video every day [] young people are movg away because the lack  water is stealg their futures herders are havg to leave for the cities because their livestock died  thirst traders gra farmers  hunters people from across northern Cameroon are leavg their homes they are climate refugees a sign  thgs to come but climate is hardly ever

natural source  water  the area researchers from the International Organization for Migration have come to the region surroundg lake chad to vestigate the connection between climate change  the rise  climate migration mushara murillo  the UN migration organization has spent years  the Sahil region every encounter  every conversation adds another layer  detail to his prelimary fdgs [] today Murillo  his team are visitg a camp for displaced people  their Lake Chad under the shadow  a nearly barren tree he speaks with Mohammad Ibrahim the head  the family Ibrahim tells Murillo he is a herder the family suffered a terrible ordeal before fally arrivg at Lake Chad it was heat  lack  water that drove him from their home climate change has a huge impact on us herders if there's no ra no plants grow  without green plants to eat our animals die so we herders are hit very hard by this from the chat the chat side Nigerian side the Cameroonian side  either side they all depended on this source you can realize that this lake is unique is just a freshwater with  an arid area so so many levels dependent on this lectured if the lake chad disappears it will be a serious environmental catastrophe because without the lectures we can hardly talk about a livg atmosphere  the lake Chad region  1963 lake chad covered an area  25,000 square kilometres by 2007 it was just 2,500 square kilometres more than 90 percent smaller  the lake contues to shrk if the lake were to completely dry up more than 50 million people would probably become climate refugees  this figure does not take to account the rate  population growth lake chad remas a life source for millions  people but as it contues to shrk water is becomg an ever scarce ER  more valuable resource  so our arable l  the fish  the lake as Lake Chad gets smaller competition for these resources will become creasgly bitter even now fishermen  the region are competg for dwdlg stocks  carp Nile perch  tilapia with climate change there is a key impact on the lake  that it it affect the distribution  the pattern  fish  is that  md its effect the fishg dustry as well so basically it's it touches on three major level strategies  people around  this surroundg this area namely farmers hair does  fishermen the region surroundg Lake Chad is emblematic  the close connection between climate change  migration []  the past we had a lot  fish good fish we sold them here or over  Nigeria but now they have problems with terrorists  here we have no more fish  our lake from Lake Chad to Indonesia farmers can no longer rely on predictable seasons for plantg  harvestg the climate has become a threat there are hurricanes cyclones drought floodg mudslides  wildfires  the meltg permafrost could soon exacerbate all  those around the globe on the american content people are fleeg droughts  northern Brazil  the Caribbean  the southern United States it's hurricanes  Africa people are leavg the arid Sahil region some will likely head north to Europe  Spa Italy  Greece people will also flee the risg heat  Asia coastal regions are vanishg under risg oceans people are fleeg to higher ground  river deltas like Bangladesh the South Sea Isls will be completely submerged how many people will have become climate refugees by 2050 we know at the moment that approximately 20 million people are beg displaced every year that's numbers more or less true for the last decades so we can say that under climate change population growth possibly more vulnerable populations this number is gog to grow if you look today we know that every year at least 25 million people flee so the fast forward 30 years so that's why I thk if you go to the figure 500 millions it's not a very high estimate seizures are the names  the do this gee Monsieur if I had to estimate I'd say maybe a fifth or a quarter  the world's population will be forced to migrate so that's about two to three billion people [] you"
53,0.0,I had a strange dream I was walkg through a golden temple beneath the dome  glass  through chambers  splendor filled with so many objects that the heart so desires I saw miracles  human skill  artistry  flawless begs who seemgly lacked nothg but it appeared they were all searchg for somethg [] such strange creatures [] the whole world is  a big mess the more they get the more they want president Bush after 9/11 said I urge all Americans to go shoppg this prt would still make me money it's the thg  me I grew up  a way that I will still make money even if I was left  the desert there is someone who tries to say you need this there are enough people who thk they need that that's what the marketg strategy is is that it always tells you you shouldn't be content the mge is not humans are by nature greedy evolution has shown us that as long as this mechanism doesn't become too domant it serves the goals  the dividual perfectly dividuals each mujuy to survive today I go so far as to say it's a symptom  an illness catastrophe is on its way catastrophe you  I we cannot even image I wonder if we're a viable form  life maybe we're just an evolutionary flash  the pan  we'll be sittg right next to the dosaurs at the cockroach Museum one thg I would love to say that you must always thk  your death [] [] I kept askg myself why are we like this we're carg  compassionate but we're also egocentric  reckless we give  reward we create  destroy what is our problem what drives us I went  search  answers [] humanities at the crossroads I thk a historical moment the physical environment is underme to the pot where we need to attend to it war is somethg that we ought to thk about what why does that happen people are pervasively unhappy on top  all  that we keep buildg Walmart's I see satiable greed as extricably connected to all  these other difficulties that if we don't recognize  come to terms with we're literally puttg our species at risk you know you might ask to talk about Darw well if you're asked to talk about Darw it has to be about evolution  what's the word evolution mean change  so so evolution is an idea that Darw is tryg to underst  what's his strikgly origal proposal natural selection suit [] Cubans are on the one h very similar to all other forms  life  that we share a basic biological predisposition you know towards survival but on the other h we're so smart that we actually recognize that we exist []  the pot here is that beg alive  knowg it is grounds for great joy [] on the other h it also carries a very terrible existential burden if you know that you're here you know that someday like all livg thgs that you won't be here if that's all we thought about I'm gonna die I may walk outside  get hit by a meteor we would literally be paralyzed by abject terror what human begs did is to construct  mata what the anthropologists today call culture  all cultures fer some recipe for immortality either literally through the heavens  after lives  recarnation z'  all the world's great religions or symbolically through the belief that some vestige  our identity will persist over time nevertheless [] that's why you want to have children that's why you want to build pyramids that's why we want to write great books  symphonies that's why we want to have a lot  money human begs are motivated to have a lot  stuff because psychologically speakg it gives them a sense that they may be able to live forever desire greed  the struggle that brgs about anger  aggression from the philosophical Buddhist philosophical perspective are all resultant states  a person consistently tryg to look at what is not true we talk about three fundamental truths that thgs are impermanent secondly the fundamental prciple  everythg is said to be emptess [] but now what happens is we try to build somethg that makes us forget about this we try to make thgs permanent  that struggle creates the third truth  this sufferg we beg to then hang on to thgs I'll give you an example you know if I have a shirt  every time I go out to do some shoppg you buy another shirt you may have 12  your closet but you'll buy the thirteenth just so that you have a sense  you'll live long enough to wear altered  shirts or perhaps even more than that so there's a sense  every day consistently dog somethg because  which we may be able to more solidify our sense  immortality our sense  livg contuously not changg  that struggle consistently builds up all these neuroses  the proment one  them becomes the greed [] death is a very real physical phenomenon  it doesn't matter how good your symbols are your religion your politics your money there's still symbols  none  them will be sufficient to mimize death anxiety or rather to elimate it you can reduce it but you can't get rid  it  then fally just really to make matters worse we also don't like the idea that we're animals from a starkly biological pot  view we're not all that much more significant or endurg than lima beans or armadillos an animal takes only what it needs but the human animal is different more than seven billion  us populate the planet  each  us desires somethg desires more is this perhaps the secret  success [] [] the UM mess strumentally now developed struments to measure greed as a personality trait  also to elicit a state  greed  people mentioned  Irel social context  a citizen associates this is the balloon task we use it to measure our test subjects willgness to take risks the subject has to try to keep flatg  the loom the larger the balloons the more it's worth the punch period  each round the subjects play for real money every time they flate the balloon they're riskg that it might first  then their money would be gone as pets I cur nest we've been able to demonstrate that people who tend to be greedy are more likely to take risks when performg this task so they flate the balloon further than do normal test subjects  we see that people who tend towards greed also demonstrate an altered bra response  this archaic see  this graphic we see how our bra responds to rewards  a punishment so far we've been able to demonstrate that the more greedy the test subject the weaker are the punishments signals so she has deed wished  technology GABA is this teresante that's that what is terestg is that these people also tend to want to mata night State the classic experiments  old Simula on the bras dopame system are very terestg  this respect the ame cystee dium if electrodes are implanted  exactly this region  a rat's bra  the rat is then put to a situation where it can stimulate that dopame system directly by pressg a lever the rats will contue pressg the lever until they die is a test equipment  this is presumably one  the biological mechanisms that helps expla excessive breed [] [] come on Ren there you go bloom we go oh you can have two okay where's my lead oh you already have two [] most primates are highly social but these guys are atypical  that they're also highly tolerant there is a hierarchy  everyone knows who's on top  the dividuals at the top get more males get more matgs females get more access to resources but you don't have this really steep hierarchy where there's one dividual at the top who gets everythg  you also see some thgs that you don't necessarily see across the primates like respect for possessions so we can look for stance at how do you respond when you get more  I get less how do you respond when you get less  I get more  that's tractable to study experimentally hey guys so the experiment itself is very simple it take two monkeys or two Apes set them next to one another  you teract with them sequentially  what they have to do is a very simple task so we give them a token they return it  give them the food reward for havg completed it but then the critical component is how does this dividual respond to that medium preferred food like a cucumber or a piece  bell pepper when their partner gets somethg much better [] see this that could be due to equity it could be due to hey look my partner got somethg better than me or it could just be due to general sort  greed for lack  a better term hey there's a better food out there  I wanted from an evolutionary perspective the behavior that we consider greed which is acquirg as many resources as possible is important most animals live more at the marg than modern Western humans do so not acquirg as many resources for them is a real risk  death  human societies so my perspective is that Green has taken on not just acquirg as much as possible but acquirg as much as possible explicitly at the expense  other dividuals  I don't thk that that's somethg that you can apply to animals one day narcissus came upon a sprg that was so clear that he could see himself  it as if  a mirror when he saw his own reflection he fell  love with its beauty we too like to see ourselves as the center  the world the dividual is now the measure  all thgs  so we yearn for recognition  selfesteem we collect relationships photos  likes SUVs shoes records are we like narcissus addicted to our own egos [] [] beg successful  busess is an art  when you have it you can be able to take thgs to a level that people would be surprised how much you describe me to price this we'll talk about that the International price this talk about our prices 700 square metres fifth floor x eight floors x our logo price one thous one thous two thous it will cost you five pot six million yeah I rather do those types  videos cuz that's exactly what it's gonna be I will tell you my philosophy is very simple there is a th le separatg a busessman  a crimal why because anythg I do somebody's bound to self cheated him so all  us as busessmen throughout the world whether it's Bill Gates its Richard Branson we are all viewed the crew knows but it's because we thk beyond other people thk President Mugabe is my brother from a European

how one dresses how you conduct yourself  how you establish that you are richer than more worthy than  therefore more immune from death than all  the other folks who surround you  some ways this is no

scientists are comg to the region  several countries have claimed mg rights how will those rights be allocated geologists can now study l that used to be covered  ice l that is rich  natural resources the competition for this Arctic treasure is fierce these resources clude oil natural gas  rare earth elements taken together they're worth trillions  dollars the digenous peoples who live  the Arctic region say they deserve a share  these riches new sources  come would help them improve their lives  have more  a say  government policies that affect them [] these scientists will be the first to study a particularly remote part  Arctic Canada that feels great you know after days are waitg  then you get ready to go on the field we got close twice  now we're gettg on that's excellent right let's see what awaits it'll probably be a bumpy ride because  bad weather more than a century ago Arctic expeditions led by Umberto Nabila  fred Vigna made headles around the world today research trips to the region are not nearly as demg as they used to be but they are expensive about 15,000 euros per person [] [] resolute Bay is ten used as a startg pot for scientific expeditions  the 1950s the Canadian government forced digenous people from northern Quebec to settle  this remote but strategically important region Susan Sullivan ik was a child at the time [] there has been a lot  scientists that have come up here  I guess there are more now I'm expectg that there'll be a lot more people comg up north to fd out more about vegetation or thgs that were frozen that are tryg [] July 1st is Canada Day the country's national holiday but the local Inuit residents don't have much to celebrate the village  resolute Bay needs more jobs schools  hospitals the uit want more fancial support from the canadian government they also dem more autonomy so that they can live accordg to their traditional values Susan Sullivan ik hopes that her grchildren will be able to lead better lives than she  her parents did she says that the Canadian government should formally apologized for the forced resettlement  the Inuit people  provide better jobs  job trag programs [] for young people they are today there are so many more possibilities for them to get proper education  we hope that we'll see with the 10 20 years that they'll be an  abductor we now have lawyers we now have well nurses that are Inuit but we need more  with  the pressional system the Arctic region cludes parts  five countries [] Denmark Norway Russia the USA  Canada  1999 the Canadian government created a new Northern Territory called Nunavut which means our l summer has arrived  Nunavut but it's still cold just three degrees centigrade the researchers arrived from resolute Bay they'll spend two months on the territories north coast there are no settlements here  no roads either there's not a lot  vegetation because the tundra subsoil is permanently frozen the scientists set up their camp  it's anythg but luxurious their only connection to the outside world are the transport helicopters this expedition is fanced by the governments  Canada  Germany Germany has vested a lot  money  Arctic research  will contue to do so I thk it's very important as we contue to study the effects  global warmg we need to fd out more about how the entire climate system functions  the descansar clima vdz gansan

American biologist John Speer will study microbes that could be used  research on antibiotic resistant bacteria so right these are each one  these little green tough tubes is $15 each  they are for extractg DNA out  samples so I'll collect like a little bit  a pencil eraser sized amount  material  I will sert it to these tubes  we'll shake it around I'll take it home  we'll extract DNA out  it at home [] the weather is good today so the scientists head out to do some work when these mountas were formed millions  years ago the local environment looked much different there was no ice cover  the l was covered with plants  trees geologists take a longterm view  life on earth they thk  terms  millennia not centuries  many scientists believe that today we are livg  the fal stages  the most

the Arctic the topsoil thaw is only  the summertime grass B speculates on the origs  the sprg we're fdg more  more different areas with Sprgs  we're able to record the temperatures we've left data loggers  the sprgs through the wter  we can see that they flow all wter long so it turns out that these very high latitude arctic regions is actually some areas  very active groundwater flow  it challenges all our conceptions as to what's happeng  it really tells us we we don't know as much as we thought we did so it's excitg because new thgs to learn the researchers have dug this the ice

natural resources the growg Chese middle class is basically screamg for resources from all over the planet     the Arctic is no exception so what you see is basically the same terest for resources as

that  the Arctic meanwhile back  Arctic Canada Victoria Pease prepares to fly back to camp the research that she  her colleagues are dog here could be used by any number  countries the scientists have no control over where their data ends up  that's fe with Victoria [] I look at the tectonic environment where rocks form  that formation is useful to the dustry  what they do with it is beyond me this research work is difficult timeconsumg  expensive it's not yet clear on the government's  busesses that are fundg these projects we'll make use  all the data but if they have a strategic terest  the Arctic after the ice they'll have to start preparg now I just start with some materials from the Frankl Bas these researchers at Germany's Institute for geosciences  natural resources  Hanover are gog to analyze some rock samples that were taken f the coast  western Greenl they've got a lot  work ahead  them first they'll cut away a slice  rock that's just 30 microns thick about the same width as a sheet  paper then they'll exame it under a microscope my calendars Jesus Christus this sample is almost transparent it's thner than a sgle human hair that will allow us to exame  detail how this material teracts with light  that will help us identify the dividual merals that are contaed  this sample current video centive  AHA lead  if it's here we return to Nunavut the local residents sometimes fd jobs helpg the foreign research teams several countries have a vested terest  exploitg the region's natural resources  the scientists research may help them to do that the Inuit hope that is the Arctic ice contues to melt they'll be able to share  the economic benefits  have more  a say  how they live their lives over the centuries the Inuit have proven that they can adapt to even the harshest climate conditions but they're tired  livg  primitive dwellgs  eatg only the meat  fish that nature provides as their ancestors did before them this is Greenl's capital nuke located on the southwest coast Greenl has been part  Denmark sce 181 but now enjoys a great deal  autonomy still subsidy payments from Denmark make up about 60%  the territory's budget the capital is  the middle  a construction boom as Greenl gas more control over the allocation  revenues generated by the exploitation  natural resources we want to diversify our economy  terms  generatg new come sources for our country we see the mg as as a future come source along with tourism along with other dustries that we are tryg to attract to Greenl so there is a consideration  makg our economy less vulnerable for rapid there or somethg changes ficial the fishg dustry is a key element  Greenl's economy fish  shellfish make up about 90%  total exports  as much as 20%  GDP Greenl left the European Economic Community  1985  a dispute over fishg policy part  today's catch is beg unloaded at the part  nuke Maalik Olson works for Royal Greenl the territory's largest fishg company it has more than 0 processg facilities  Greenl  also on Canada's Atlantic coast the company headquarters are located here  nuke the most important fish or shellfish is shrimp for Greenl I thk it has a good price  the ternational market so it's a good species to have at the moment our ma suppliers are the local fishermen  for the near coastal fishery so there are approximately 3,000 people fishermen deliverg the fish for our factories  besides that we have a lot  trawlers that are fishg   the sea Royal Greenl also operates its own fleet  fishg vessels one  them is just come to port Manik Olson meets the capta the ship was at sea for two weeks  brought  250 tons  fish the catch was immediately frozen on board this is the coolg facility the temperature is mus 25 degrees centigrade each bag contas 30 kilos  cod some scientists predict the climate change will force large numbers  fish  shellfish to move north to colder water  addition there are dications that the area f Greenl's coast is beg overfished Moloch has seen that happen before the cut is a species that is comg back back  the 80s there was a lot  a lot  cut  the Greenlic sea but suddenly it disappeared so there hasn't been cut fishg  the last 20 years  Greenl so it's its first the last years that it started to come back after the trawler unloads its catch it goes back out to sea the market for fish  fish products is good right now sales  prices are risg still the fishg dustry does not generate enough revenue to support Greenl's entire economy on its own so the territory will have to fd new sources  come at the moment the fishery is not cannot alone mata this economy for Greenl so we have to welcome some new busesses   Greenl tourism is one  the thgs that the politicians are talkg about   there we have to develop new busesses to to ga some more economic growth  Greenl [] Greenl is one  Europe's most remote tourist destations but visitors are not attracted by luxury hotels or wellness facilities there are none here they have come to see the territories breathtakg natural beauty those who are lookg for a unique travel experience will fd it here there are rus  Vikg settlements [] the Northern Lights  Arctic wildlife cludg redeer these vast lscapes are populated by more than 20 species  mammals  dozens  bird species [] but Greenl is an expensive place to visit food prices are high mostly because supplies have to be imported the frastructure needs a lot  work only small planes can l at the airport  Newark the runway is too short for large commercial passenger jets greenl's government is tryg to le up foreign vestors who will help fance improvements high on the list  potential partners are Chese busesses I'm not afraid    general I thk  as as a market for commodities   metals  merals is an important vestment country last year a company owned by the Chese government submitted a bid for the expansion  three small airports  Greenl but the government  Denmark stepped   blocked the bid citg security  fancial concerns  any case Greenl needs to make a serious effort to improve its frastructure defitely the the logistics are very difficult Greenl is far away from both Europe  North America it's a very big isl the biggest isl  the world spread out over a very large area so defitely logistical challenges  also environmental challenges  forms  form  bad weather  large parts  Greenl many people earn a livg by huntg one  them is Tobias ignites Yuson who lives  Tazi Locke on the southeast coast durg the summer he goes huntg every week  the wter months he catches fish this is the only way that he can provide food for his family it's new poppg up my father  brothers taught me how to hunt I no longer alive so now I'll go by myself Benny I heard it my family lives on the meat all the fish that I brg back so far we've always had enough to eat we've never gone hungry I made sure  that Tobias  his family eat redeer  musk ox meat at summer   wter mostly seals  narwhals a small species  whale [] Tobias is not concerned that the Arctic ice is meltg he's learned to adapt to his environment Tobias ten takes along foreign tourists on his huntg trips the extra come has allowed him to buy a few luxuries like a snowmobile  an outboard motor for his boat been out dog it be out okay we can't grow vegetables here we can only eat what nature provides  we don't waste any food if we don't eat it right away we'll freeze it  store it either killg them weepg on top top those who prefer to buy their food stead  huntg or fishg for it can shop at the supermarket's to Zoellick but the food  the shops is expensive because a lot  it has to be imported mostly from Europe some food supplies are brought  by helicopter [] there aren't many trees  Greenl only a few species are able to grow here mostly  the far south but that may change because  global warmg durg the summer some crops are grown  the south as legend has it the region was given the name Greenl by a tenth century Norse explorer he hoped that a pleasant soundg name would attract settlers [] the residents  tezi lakh would love to grow vegetables here  the summer  that may happen if the Arctic ice contues to melt two thous people live  two Zoellick it's the largest town  southeastern Greenl but behd the colorful facades  these homes many people suffer from depression  alcoholism the community only recently started to discuss these problems openly the causes clude the town's high unemployment rate  the poverty that goes along with it domestic abuse is common the suicide rate among young men is high  durg the wter the bodies can't be buried because the ground is frozen [] [] the local mortuary is located next to a church the bodies are kept here until sprg many local residents simply have not been able to cope with the transition from a seminomadic eco centered culture to a modern society that's based on commerce  consumerism some are frustrated by the presence  wealthy tourists when they themselves can't fd a job there's no need to go huntg anymore when you can just buy food at the supermarket many people have ended up on welfare [] [] [] every family  Greenl knows the pa  the social problems that we are seeg  the statistics  they are quite high I mean it's both suicides  as I said we do see a lot  violence as well  violence agast women  children  this is somethg that we need to fix  I thk we need to fix it with the next generation or otherwise it will be every every family is beg affected by this three four times over we have to stop it now Tilly Martez son is a member  Greenl's Parliament  has been speakg out on these problems she's half Inuit  half Danish she believes that Greenl should mata close ties to Denmark because she fears that the digenous peoples will not be able to survive on their own politician aleko Hammond also hopes for a better future for Greenl but she believes that this will only happen if the territory ws its dependence from Denmark I have a Danish passport but that's all I am not Danish I don't thk Danish I don't speak Danish at home I don't feel like a Dane  I don't feel like at home when I'm  Denmark [] Greenl contues to move toward dependence from Denmark  today even young Inuit children learned to take pride  their traditional culture their language  their homel [] a lot  people around the world are defitely concerned about the effects  global warmg but Benny  Greenl see these environmental changes as an opportunity to free themselves from foreign fluence many  the European immigrants who helped build this territory are buried  the cemetery dependence is a question  what society that we want  the future for the people  Greenl dependence is a question  the freedom  the choices the government  Greenl should be dog  regards to the Foreign Affairs  terms  the safety  the military issues connected to Greenl Denmark is responsible for Greenl security  matas several military bases here but  the near future Greenl will have more control over its defense  foreign policy still some Danes are reluctant to sever ties completely for a number  different reasons the Danish Greenlic relationship goes back many hundred years so there is there is cultural ties there is historical ties people have married each other there a lot  Greenlers livg  denmark there's a lot  Danish people livg  Greenl so so so it's not just you know a matter  pullg the plug  then say from now on we are dependent Denmark also understs the importance  matag good relations with a territory that is strategically important  rich  natural resources as the competition for those resources tensifies Denmark aims to mata a security presence there many Danes believe that the government's current policies on Greenl benefits both sides that is where I would argue that that it is difficult to fd a better deal if you are lookg at the world from a Greenlic perspective then then beg partner with with Denmark   I would doubt that if you partner up with  or anyone else that there would be no favors asked  return  keeps a close eye on developments  the Arctic from its embassy  Reykjavik Icel the Ambassador says that the world has nothg to fear from Beijg's trade policies the Chese government has no tention  a competg with the US side for worldly fluence we regard issues based on his merit  also we have a strong wish to develop a good relationship with all the countries as world powers compete for position  fluence  Greenl the Inuit people are stg up for their rights when these children grow up they may fd themselves livg  a country that has won its freedom from Denmark but is heavily dependent on  the Inuits  Canada also want more autonomy some even favor closer ties with Inuit peoples  other countries we were one people before governments were organized  divided as through borders we work with why we work across borders we have always been one  eight we recognize that we know we have rights as it teaches people Oh colic egg easyacc is a former chair  the Inuit circumpolar Council  ten speaks out on issues that affect digenous peoples here she's meetg with an old friend former Nunavut premier Eva reack they've set up camp on the outskirts  none  its capital Iqaluit we will never completely lose who we are that's it's not  the picture [] [] we want to work with our governments  we want to work with the dustries that are up here they want to come up here recognize that fact  work with us to your collective benefit I guess every year hundreds  delegates from dozens  countries gather  Reykjavik for the annual Arctic Circle assembly the participants clude politicians scientists busess executives representatives  digenous peoples  others who are terested  the future  the Arctic region  how it will be affected by climate change the organization's chairman is former Icel president Olafur a grim son he says it's important to brg together as many ternational representatives as possible to discuss policy [] the problem for the Arctic is not  the Arctic  it's  the heavily dustrialized countries  the world  without puttg that  perspective we will never ga a comprehensive understg  the future  the Arctic the Arctic ice has been rapidly meltg now for two decades the process has even affected glaciers  Greenl that are 100,000 years old scientists estimate that 10,000 tons  Arctic ice are lost every second due to global warmg but some say that this may turn out to be a positive development summers are gettg longer there's vegetation growg I I believe you know there are a lot  all annuity thgs that have become so I guess it's their prophecy I believe this prophecy as the Arctic ice contues to melt the digenous people st to benefit from the exploitation  the region's natural resources  the creation  new trade routes creased prosperity may help them to preserve their natural way  life but as Olaf I goodi'm s pots out the future  the Arctic has become an ternational issue we are now seeg for the first time  human history the Arctic

to the Caspian Sea the construction  this railway le was once the prestige project  the sheriff Persia a central vestment  frastructure ysha razor shark add a lot about Iran's economic development but what I am victims admitted then with the one he did a great service to this country by buildg the railway up  Peter  you know how much to visit Iran I love our Mustafa passengers  cargo are transported by tra there 38 millions  passengers a year as well as lots  maches vehicles  goods or years too much  1925 when Reza Khan came to power as Reza Shah Persia was a structurally weak agricultural country the tra was tended to help the country called Iran from 1935 onwards flourish economically the Shah ruled with an iron fist  the day the Islamic   Iran has it's very own understg  democracy there's no freedom  the press here the railway owes its existence to the country's natural resources it was built to transport oil passenger transport was unimportant at first but that's all my young follow my wishes I always take the tra when I travel jovica thought they said  verse 11 sir the Tra is a good mode  transport that you can wrestle well our army can defitely me either have me at the Hoover it's a very journey I'm retired we shall get the media for a year Iowa before that I worked with the raw materials company for 30 years servg my country well model our bottom we're  one  the most significant regions for global energy Iran has the world's fourth largest oil  second largest natural gas reserves the stateowned companies don't publish exactly how much they extract every

to the ships on the Persian Gulf runs right next to us suppose as message about a shared capta as vanishes get enough as we might set a model have any job that might set him on Castro without the oil the railway le wouldn't have been built oil exports created the economic conditions for its construction that was unusual  Asia at the time railway les were largely planned by the various colonial rulers  built for their needs  dependent Iran however the Shah was  charge even raised special taxes I said  foolish as money money for the railway le came from a tax on sugar  she sisted that way we didn't have to get to debt with other countries she's hearted you know that negative the construction  the trans Iranian railway to the good 11 years 230 tunnels  ,100 bridges were needed for the difficult terra it was worth it the costs  transportg oil were reduced by 80 percent it used to take weeks to transport the oil now it could be done  a matter  days [] water has also always been

these pilgrims are hungry for sohan guns said to have the best so hon it's made  wheat germ flour  sugar  sometimes cardamom saffron oil or butter even though few people talk about the char these days when he tried so hard durg a visit to bomb he made it famous throughout the country uh very we asked dyad for his secret recipe but he would only tell us a little bit we got part  it you should start

outside the city nobody lives here but it connects to the highspeed rail le to Tehran I just feel that we're proud to have a tra that so fast high speeds aren't without their problems we don't like the stress durg the day  particular it can happen that people step onto the tracks there's no fencg that's not good but apart from that it's great on the last 135 kilometers to Tehran the tra races through the desert here it's cool side thanks to the air conditiong unit  there's a movie playg it's the pride  joy  the Iranian railway we're on the Iranian railways fastest tra the parties it was

traveled with horses  camels they would spent the night  such a caravanserai what's fered on each other still hasn't yet become a very distant there were caravanserai is every 30 to 0 kilometers along the route roughly how far a caravan  camels could travel  a day the central courtyard is a characteristic feature this is where the horses  camels were looked after it was a welcomg place where travelers could relax  bathe  refuel for the next leg through the desert but now we're gog to Tehran by Express tra travelers don't need caravansaries anymore now they can be gently rocked to sleep we soon reached the outskirts  Tehran Iran's capital has a population  more than 8 million  the mid 1920s when razor shark to power the city had just 250,000 residents he fueled the modernization  the city thereby attractg more  more people he had the ma station  Tehran built by a German company it's currently beg refurbished we've covered around 900 kilometers sce the start  our journey it's time for brakes we can get an idea  the size  Tehran from Mount Russia which overlooks the city the bazaar quarters are must for every visitor to the city [] we dive to one  the biggest bazaars  the world ed 10 kilometers long 30 thous shops  a hundred thous jobs the bazaar is the shop owners are powerful  1979 they were among the supporters  the Islamic Revolution fearg the shah's prowestern economic

for a light headscarf she wants to buy it for a young woman or a girl if a customer wants a black headscarf it's either for an older woman or she has no time  has to buy one quickly notice there are

make men overly aggressive this is Leone home  Frances Center for cognitive neurosciences jeanclaude Rhea is a research director here Draya has been studyg the fluence  testosterone on human behavior  he's found little evidence that testosterone strokes aggression  men to the effect that testosterone has on human behavior is by no means clear but there is some direct evidence example high levels  testosterone have been found  some prison mates who have committed serious crimes  we did a study which dicated that patients who are given testosterone jections could become more aggressive it's only 50 million new condition testosterone can also actually improve social behaviors noxee pal some problems related CBT so at this pot there's little hard evidence potg to a lk between creased levels  testosterone  aggressive behavior drea conducted an experiment to try to prove or disprove these claims his first task was to measure the testosterone levels  the participants blood testosterone is a fatsoluble hormone so it can pass through the membranes  cells bd with hormone receptors  then produce changes  the cell's structure testosterone can be identified  measured  various bodily fluids cludg saliva ure  blood before the experiment begs one group  participants is jected with testosterone the other group is given a placebo we tried to determe whether the crease  testosterone levels would contribute to a change  behavior this graph shows that both groups started out with approximately the same level  testosterone jections then we gave one group testosterone jections  recorded the crease  the level  this hormonal system now the test subjects are gog to take part  a game exercise called ultimatum the game is frequently used  behavior research it's designed to test whether a person is generous or selfish one  the players is given a sum  money  is required to share part  it with the other if the second player accepts the fer the deal goes ahead as planned but if he rejects it neither player gets any money at this pot we observed no difference between the player who had been given testosterone  the one who has until to systole  I said that now the rules  the game are gog to change a bit the players will be able to use the money to reward fair behavior or punish unfair behavior  this is where Draya  his colleagues observed a difference between the player who got an extra dose  testosterone  the one who didn't [] silver bishop team miss Cruz it's a subtle difference  we confirmed it only  the second stage  the experiment the group admistered with extra testosterone imposed a more severe punishment when they believed that they hadn't been given enough money but at the same time they also reacted more positively when given more money than expected we observed a big difference  the behavior  the two groups even loopdeloop so can testosterone also stimulate generosity  men the researchers were surprised by the results but the situation is more complex than that Draya says there's a subconscious motivation at work here [] this phenomenon shows clearly that you can improve your social status if you cooperate with people or engage  other kds  positive social behaviors utility so while testosterone can fluence aggression it also plays a role  the ability to act with generosity so the noise State drea has been lookg for more evidence to support his theory on the fluence  testosterone so he's been studyg bra activity 30 system testosterone based behavior can improve the man social status  that process could be lked to various mechanisms  the bra particularly a group  neural structures known as the reward system baltimore improved social status generates a sense  wellbeg like a reward that may expla the boastg trade commonly associated with excessive manly behavior to god there's always a motivation behd generosity if someone sees you beg generous they're more likely to thk highly  you for example men will probably be more generous if they know that they are beg observed by women cubes this dicates another lk between testosterone  generous behavior so testosterone may be responsible for positive  negative behavior  both cases this behavior seems to be directed at preservg or even improvg social status [] psychologist Pranjal Mehta is an associate pressor at  College  London his research focuses on how hormones particularly testosterone fluence human behavior the evidence for that myth that testosterone is directly related to mascule traits like aggression has not worn out  the data so there are plenty  results suggestg that testosterone is either weekly or unrelated to aggressive behavior at all   humans cludg human males so the field is still tryg to unpack these kds  effects to underst when testosterone might be related to other behaviors like helpg  prosocial behavior as well meta has carried out an experiment that volves the ultimatum game similar to the one we saw earlier it's actually a way to look at two kds  behaviors one is trust to what extent is the firstmover trustg  two to look at reciprocity  trust if someone is hyper trustg is the second move are gog to reciprocate that trust as  the experiment carried out by jeanclaude rhea one player was given an extra dose  testosterone the other player was given a placebo the experiment will measure the level  trust between the two the player admistered testosterone can use his money to make sure that the other player also prits but will the second player give back some  his wngs as a gesture  gratitude or will he keep it all for himself we found two terestg effects first is consistent with the stereotype testosterone reduced trust  the first mover so that is somewhat consistent with the stereotype testosterone beg related to competitiveness  threatened the environment  maybe mobilizg more selfish social behaviors right so I want to keep the money next the players reverse their roles  both tests the player with the extra testosterone shares his wngs with the other this is an example  prosocial behavior we know that reciprocity  cooperative situations that is gog to Gardner status  what we found is that testosterone boosted reciprocity  we're argug that  a cooperative environment it's aga as through prestige  prosocial behaviors that you ga status  so though  those situations testosterone actually might boost prosocial behavior Mehta is convced that testosterone plays a much more complex role  human behavior than researchers previously thought for example it can promote socially positive behavior but there's always a motivatg factor behd that behavior you can image when we thk about our leaders  people  positions  power they have expertise knowledge  experience that they're gonna relay to their subordates that's part  beg a good leader that's also part  some defitions  power where you're helpg others as a way to fluence others  some way so you can thk  it as prosocial but it's also  some defitions an exertion  power but concepts such as masculity status  power are perceived differently  various cultures around the world we'll the test results differ from one country to the next so my laboratories  London someone else's laboratory is  Germany someone else's laboratory is  a rural part  the south  the United State that should see erratically be expected to change the results but the effects  testosterone on the human body are the same regardless  culture  geography when Christian Wulff found out that he was fertile he started lookg for solutions my

rg fgers  men it's just the opposite you can see that  this image  a man's h the dex fger is clearly shorter than the rg fger testosterone clearly has an fluence on bone growth even  the early stages  pregnancy it may also be responsible for the early development  the socalled power motive yes isn't shaft Liam Priscilla  Sean Service is that a scientist I'm terested  fdg out where that motive comes from I suspect that its origs can be found  biology here salt ice is conductg an experiment  which the participants write a fantasy narrative this may help him to determe whether they are motivated by power the power motive is a common human characteristic that volves one person's efforts to have an impact on the behavior  others this motivation does not necessarily manifest itself  conscious attitudes or the beliefs that we have about ourselves our research dicates that the way we perceive ourselves actually has little to do with what makes us tick  what fluences our spontaneous behaviors from fluence this part  the experiment volves a series  10 tests aimed at fdg out how the participants respond to victory or defeat the test results can be manipulated one participant can w up to eight  the ten rounds the researchers want to fd out whether any changes take place  the test subjects hormone levels [] we found that the power motive plays a role  their response to wng or losg those who won had higher levels  testosterone than those who lost even Phyllida  if one  the participants is not motivated by power but ws it has no effect on the amount  testosterone  his system we can't say that wng or losg is exclusively responsible for changes  testosterone levels we have to take to account factors such as the dividual's personality  motivation but those factors are shaped by testosterone durg fetal bra development clicked human thick lung but does it all come down to testosterone  its fluence  determg for example male fger length  the development  the power motive women have only 10%  the testosterone levels found  men does that mean that they are less motivated by power we are vited  the space colony  vibe there's evidence that dicates that there is a connection between the length  woman's fgers  the power motive complex it's a complex situation that will require a lot more research scientists have learned more  recent years about female sex hormones but the relationship between women  power has not been widely studied the field has focused on male reproductive system  males for the past hundred years  has largely neglected lookg at female sex hormones  the context  status  leadership  this is this is a large gap  the literature today we've come to the   Cambridge to talk to clical psychologist Simon baroncohen part  his research focuses on how gender affects human behavior  general  the bra  particular we've been lookg at sex differences  the md between males  females on average  one  their tests that we use is where you have to fd a shape that's hidden  a design as quickly as you can  we fd that on average men are faster at fdg this target hidden  the overall design Baron Cohen  his colleagues conducted behavioural studies  children  adolescents they started by testg hormone levels  numerous samples  amniotic fluid the liquid that helps protect the fetus  the womb we've measured the testosterone durg pregnancy  the womb  the amniotic fluid so this is the baby  the womb  some women durg pregnancy have a clical procedure it's called amniocentesis where a needle goes to that fluid to take out some  the fluid  we can measure testosterone  the fluid  babies vary  terms  how much  the hormone they are exposed to so boys show more more testosterone than girls  the amniotic fluid  the early stages  fetal development the genitalia show no signs  gender distction but after approximately the seventh week  gestation a gene on the Y chromosome can activate a process that results  the development  testicles later testosterone plays a role  the development  mascule characteristics  several parts  the male fetus cludg the bra we're lookg at these longterm effects  the hormones presumably mediated by changes  bra development so we're measurg the behavior but the assumption is that the hormones have changed bra development  males  females because they're exposed to different amounts  the hormone after the babies  baroncohen study were born he measured  analyzed their reaction to a series  images what we found was that the higher the child's prenatal testosterone the less eye contact the child makes at their first birthday so this was them a surprise for us because you would thk iContact is fluenced by social factors but actually it seems to also be fluenced by prenatal testosterone the children were tested aga at the age  two the results dicated that girls more actively sought eye contact than boys did  had better verbal skills they talked earlier  their language develops faster what we didn't know is why why do girls have this advantage  language development but now we could relate it back to the prenatal testosterone because we found that children who had a higher prenatal testosterone had smaller vocabularies years later baroncohen conducted more tests on the children they were shown images  various facial expressions  were asked to describe the emotion the images portrayed  aga we found that the higher the child's prenatal testosterone the more difficulty they have on this test  empathy which is a surprise aga for us because we're fdg there's even there it's eight years later sce we measured the testosterone there's still an effect that we're observg to sum up girls did better on tests that volved verbal  social skills boys were better at developg analytical skills the same hormone seems to be volved not only  social development like readg faces  language  eye contact but also  non social skills like pattern recognition   takg thgs apart to see parts with the homes a bit like on the rubic cube where you have to see the pattern very quickly the tests dicate that boys better able to underst abstract concepts but have less empathy Baron Cohen has used the fdgs to support his theory  a possible lk between testosterone  autism we looked at the relationship between typical sex differences  autism because what is amiss more common  boys so we were tryg to underst why why why why does beg a boy lead you to a higher likelihood that you'll develop autism  the answer we're gettg is that one factor may be prenatal testosterone research on this subject is still  the early stages  experts are still tryg to fd out what role prenatal testosterone plays  determg sexual differentiation  the bra the skewness the McNish there's no evidence  predetermation  the bra we're sort  pushed one way or the other by hormonal effects  the early stages  fetal bra development  course but very much development happens later after birth  fancy  beyond when hormones act jotly with a number  external factors  the environments  above all  a child social environments  here Pranjal Mehta has been researchg the fluence that hormones  social environment have on behavior development [] researchers have cludg my lab have looked at both directions  effects how hormones fluence domance  status related behaviors  how one's social status  the environment  turn can impact hormone fluctuations  a feedback loop meter also studied how people perceive themselves  how that perception fluences their behavior do people consider themselves domant or passive  what role does testosterone play  so what we found was that testosterone didn't have a direct effect  competitive decisionmakg but it really depended on whether they filled out the questionnaire suggestg that they were high or low  domance so some  our work does suggests that hormones do impact behaviors such as competitive behavior but terestgly  consistent with the sort  myth about testosterones direct effects this depends on people's personality so the way we see ourselves so testosterone fluences our personality   turn our personality fluences our level  testosterone high levels  testosterone are said to make men virile  domant  society either views such men with respect or contempt testosterone also fuels competition among men perhaps it's no cocidence that this hormone was discovered durg the late stages  the Industrial Revolution []  the 1850s sharla Edouard Braun circa was one  the first scientists to speculate on the existence  substances that we now know as hormones he also regularly jected himself with a fluid extracted from animal testicles  claimed that this process improved his sexual prowess  physical wellbeg [] testosterone has long been associated with masculity strength  vitality [] today testosterone replacement therapy has become popular among older men  some advertisements it's touted as a miracle cure much as Braun Sekhar claimed more than a century ago pharmacies doctors  drug companies make a lot  money sellg testosterone preparations sales have creased sharply sce 2007 dr. Michelle its Mh is regularly consulted by older men sufferg symptoms  exhaustion many warrior testosterone deficiency may be the cause one Centurion zitz Mh tests the patient's sperm count  bone density among other procedures  most cases he's not able to attribute the symptoms to reduce levels  testosterone usg bad seeg this graphic shows the testosterone levels  10,000 men rangg  age from  to 90 the boys  course have very low levels signs timacy  needs a good test is to only come here  improve it the levels crease durg puberty then we see high levels  testosterone right to old age if we rule out disease there are several reasons why testosterone levels may fall  other myoss fairness is to say  the vast majority  cases these patients produce less testosterone simply because they're overweight Gupta's obesity is a problem for many older men  younger men too for that matter overweight men usually have a lot  visceral fat  that fat releases a number  harmful substances  it can lead to sul resistance high blood pressure  lower testosterone levels to be good thg one layer  body fat lies just beneath the sk a second layer visceral fat is stored  the abdomal cavity near several vital organs excess visceral fat can cut testosterone production which can promote the storage  even more fat  the abdomal cavity this causes the spare tire that's common among middleaged men testosterone is ten associated with dopg scals  competitive sports Michale Kleber with the German Olympic sports Confederation is an expert on the use  performanceenhancg substances cludg testosterone testosterone plays a key role  regulatg muscle mass  how the body responds to exercise durg prolonged physical activity the muscles suffer mor trauma so afterwards the body starts repairg the damaged muscular tissue  creasg its strength  size until recently only pressional athletes use performanceenhancg drugs now amateur athletes are takg them as well use  testosterone derivatives called anabolic steroids at commercial fitness studios is a huge problem right now we believe that 13 to 16 percent  all clients have used dopg preparations mostly anabolic steroids it's a lot more widespread among amateur athletes than it is among the pressionals healthy males produce four to eight milligrams  testosterone every day but for those who are tryg to crease muscle mass  performance that amount is too little Christian Wulff tried usg testosterone supplements to counter his hormone deficiency skip Sophia product  danger supplement new sweetie now you can fd testosterone boosters  capsules I knew that they weren't gog to work but I tried them anyway companies that make these products play on your emotions that's why I bought them   course they didn't help at all Niska but but only anabolic steroids synthetic versions  testosterone can produce the kds  results that the athletes want the use  steroids to enhance moments is widespread among bodybuilders  my night unfortunate Sabha  Habash not complete  my own research I came across the case  a 17 year old who was usg these substances he was scary he was jectg more than a thous milligrams  testosterone derivatives a week he was also takg Dianabol steroid tablets every day so  all that's a lot more than a thous milligrams a week that's a dangerous amount for a 17 year old it's a neon escapg the abuse  anabolic steroids can have a number  dangerous side effects cludg high blood pressure strokes heart attacks  liver damage excessive creases  testosterone can lead to reductions  sperm production because the bra determes that the body has enough testosterone  cuts f the supply [] Pranjal Mehta has been studyg whether substances besides testosterone can fluence human behavior for example cortisol a hormone that's ten released  response to stress  low concentrations  blood sugar there are some evidence that cortisol levels could impact the pathway between testosterone  behavioral outcomes specifically hormones don't fluence behavior directly but there's a mechanism through which they occur specifically one mechanism is they bd to a receptor for that specific hormone  the case  testosterone that would be the rogen receptor this bdg process takes place throughout the body like a key fittg to a lock Mirta believes that  stressful situations cortisol blocks the testosterone receptors [] if cortisol levels are high that could actually antagonize or or impede the relationship between testosterone  behavior presumably through molecular pathways such as receptor reduction  so we theorized what we called the dual hormone hypothesis this roleplayg exercise is designed to test the effect  cortisol on testosterone one participant gives a series  orders to the other if the player who's supposed to follow the orders feel stressed his behavior changes we found that when levels  cortisol were low that effect occurred that higher testosterone was related to more domance but when cortisol levels are high that effect wasn't there higher testosterone was not related to more domance so this is suggestg that testosterones effects on domant behavior  a position  leadership really depends on what's happeng  the stress axis  the body so is it possible that testosterone is just one  many substances that can fluence human behavior more research on this subject needs to be done at this pot experts have come to a variety  different conclusions biology does not mean simplicity I thk it's recognizg  appreciatg the complexity that's we are human begs we're dynamic systems we've developed  evolved to adapt to different environments  that hormones actually their beauty aga is that they are responsive to the environment so your hormones affect the way you behave but then the environment also affects your hormone release  general testosterone represents two  the major societal themes  our time competition  success the cliche is that men who have too little testosterone are losers men who have a lot  it are wners [] vited me which table starts ends I don't know whether I should be proud  how much testosterone I have or not it depends on what society thks or desirable qualities  men  that concept can change dependg on the culture  the era 13% testosterone is the stuff that men are made  the actual quantity is not so important but every man needs at least a mimum amount sce I started testosterone

isn't one  so a team from the German Institute for Economic Research is tryg to fd out more if you try to represent the wealth distribution  Germany  a graphic way you can do it quite simply on an a

population on this sheet here  the  area because a part  the population is  debt or even solvent  then there's a relatively broad area where assets are virtually zero until it fally starts to crease exponentially at the outer edge structors this describes 95 percent  the population but the question is  course how far away is the richest person from this manager magaze puts the Reimann family

Schmidt are you surprised that beg a politician doesn't exempt you from the danger  beg driven out  your rental no not at all  that wouldn't be good either beg a politician shouldn't guarantee preferential treatment he holds no grudge agast the prospective buyers the problem lies elsewhere so I just want to make it clear to you it's not agast you it's more agast not agast you it's assistant has lots  conditions what as a tenant Schmidt knows he'll probably be the loser  this round but as a politician Schmidt has a different opponent Christoph g'loona who wants to build  his district many local residents opposed the plans  course I'm somewhat wary  such people's because they produce a kd  urban environment that doesn't correspond to the type  environment we want to live  we say that it would be best if buildgs were owned by the people who live  them  not by people lookg to extract a prit from them the same applies to new buildgs we want people who live  the buildg's to own these buildgs as coops we're workg for the people while mr.

now please return to the audience so that everyone can see me please councillor florian schmidt was also vited to the reception I got a message from ploy on Schmidt last night tellg me you wouldn't be able to make it maly because  family reasons maybe another opportunity to meet can be arranged I'm ready  willg I'd be happy to have a chance to talk ploy on Schmidt is a representative  the people sent by his political party so basically he's just a prisoner  his own circumstances  his party  his district I wouldn't want to be  his shoes if I were I'd do thgs differently this is the district free design cords back Florian Schmitz district I don't know where thgs st mister Corona is meetg the urban planng committee next week so maybe that will be a good time Lauren Schmidt was once an activist who attended demonstrations agast big busess  its representatives people like una today he uses his role  city government to steer development  an equitable direction but he can't build the needed livg space himself the district has acquired a few buildgs but its budget is small so he needs vestors this is a gas station by the canal today the department is discussg a different project here we're talkg about closg a gap with the hotel ok well we need to put a big question mark behd that tearg down houses that people live  is just the kd  thg we don't want to be dog so I'd ask you to not give any recommendations  how this could work to listen if none at all ok Joyner  Schmidt plan to meet soon to discuss how to move forward with the formal postal fice buildg it's unclear how that conversation will go is wealth power we are absolutely at a crossroads right now  the 21st century  this very year given the sociopolitical forces that are operatg on a global scale   course that leads to the political issue political equality that stems from wealth equality you hear a lot about how wealthy people seek to fluence elections  that is certaly a very real  serious problem but it's much bigger than that studies  the u.s. have shown that the wealthy steer the direction  the country if the rich elite has a policy objective it very ten gets what it wants whatever the elite doesn't favor is likely to fall through even if it's backed by the lower come majority [] is the same true  Germany I mean Schaefer is a political scientist who's vestigated this question we were surprised to fd that the situation  Germany is skewed  much the same way as described  the US study Bundestag lawmakers have consistently geared their decisions to the terests  higher come earners  higher tier jobs  the terests  people who are less or belong to socially disadvantaged groups are systematically given less consideration  the stomata sragar fered what policies did this impact the researchers conducted hundreds  surveys on topics rangg from the economy  environment to Foreign Affairs  fance they grouped subjects to rich  poor  asked each to defe their desired policy outcome  what area was a divergence most noticeable I don't feel as well next is an obvious example the higher  dividuals come the less likely they will be to support a retroduction  the wealth tax whereas lower come earners defitely want it back to this day we haven't seen the return  such a wealth tax we're wdg up with the government  the 1% for the 1%  by the 1% at the football stadium  life seche gustav

Schmidt arise when he gets a buildg permit that he has to sign  he doesn't sign it it just doesn't sign I don't thk that's okay I thk that's when he should have the guts to say yes I'm a politician  I'm  the green party but right now mr. guna has a right to his buildg permit so whether I like it or not I'm gog to sign I'd say there are at least two ways to see that other people would say I have guts precisely because I'm not signg the buildg permit people feel frustrated  I sort  do too even though now I make a decent livg I live  a small apartment  I'm lookg to move  there's simply nothg on the market appeal or if there is somethg a hundred people are waitg  le hey we'd be welcome to rent one  our flats we'll see but I do feel that ultimately what's happeng here is a struggle for power

behavior it's a question social psychologist Paul piff has been researchg for years for one  his experiments he enlisted hundreds  people to play a rigged game  Monopoly what we did  this game  Monopoly was just manipulate with the flip  a co whether some people were rich or other people were poor we romly assigned one person to be this rich player  this rigged game so they got two times the money to play the game they got to roll both dice stead  one to move around the board  what we found is that across all  these different sessions richer players made more noise as they moved around the board they took up more space  the room with their bodies we had a bowl  pretzels the richer players took more pretzels  they are more likely to be talkg to the other person with their mouths full when we asked them to describe why they'd won they were way less likely to talk about those external forces those features  the environment their luck that rom flip  a co that had gotten them to that privileged position  the first place  they were more likely far more likely to talk about what they did their own skills their own talents their own successes their own wherewithal their own acumen

people build houses  which other people live  then there's the fancial economy where property is just another asset to turn money to more money the busess journalist hs Jurgen Jakob spent years creatg

political system I do believe that I can change somethg with my little vote that's why I vote if I thought there was no possibility  changg anythg at all I wouldn't go vote either what bugs me the most is the kdergarten  school situation does that there's no acknowledgement that it's harder for a sgle parent to have a proper job that feeds the family than it is for couples it's the money it's like this  as long as those conditions for sgle moms don't change I won't go vote but can democracy work if people don't participate Clovis I thk there'll be a new order if people stop participatg

ideally those pictures should have quite a bit  overlap so that afterwards we can take the photos  piece them together prelimary estimates put the population  this colony at about 26,000 the Pengus migrate to the frozen sea ice every year to breed  raise their young but some experts say that climate change could threaten the birds existence Mali Charlotte explas why for this particular colonies there's a real risk that the structure  the sea ice that they breed on will change if the temperature rises  the ice recedes or breaks up earlier than expected the Pengus breedg season will be cut

probably died recently maybe just a few weeks ago will measure the carcass that beak length the wg length  the weight to determe their age at the time  death is the servation site for dt2 stab few other pengu colonies are studied as extensively as this one [] thermal imagg cameras  highresolution lenses record the bird's movements especially durg the wter months when they huddle together as

to counter it also there are schools that need these high school fees or thk they need them to provide a good education  most importantly we have an admistration that neither has the situation under

several years  California the cost  rent has risen so much that her salary the equivalent  1,500 euros was not enough for her to afford an apartment Maria's just one  many middleclass Americans who

American dream is far from beg achieved 0 million people are livg below the poverty le  millions  workers will go to great lengths to stay above it becomg homeless overnight is what these Americans

computer engeer will sleep sittg behd the wheel it's a world away from the comforts  his old life one thg that I've really found out about this is that you know the typical stereotype  you know the homeless person beg lazy  not wantg to work or beg a drug addict that may be the case  some places  some  some but the people have come true  this program most  them are very hardworkg people that want to get ahead that  either have some some health issues or have some had a streak  bad luck or for whatever reason they've you know come to this this this situation some people are able to get out  it quickly some people it takes longer California is a state  stark contrasts despite beg the fifth largest economy  the world a growg number  its workers can no longer afford a place to live but there is another state where the system is even more  forgivg that state is Virgia right next to Washgton DC it's capital Richmond is a former dustrial city here a quarter  the population live beneath the poverty threshold  the ten major cities with the highest rates  eviction  the country half are located  Virgia  Richmond alone around 3,000 tenants are forced out  their homes every year the evictions are a route job for ficer loyal from the sheriff's fice several times a week he distributes the dreaded yellow notices  the state  Virgia the law is strict if the rent is laid by five days the llord has the right to beg the eviction process the threatened tenants have one week to settle their debts otherwise they face eviction by force  ficer loyal does not show much sympathy this morng he  his colleagues have to evict the residents  this house  just like when arrestg a dangerous crimal they enter the home with their guns drawn the tenant is not currently at home  clearly they have not had time to vacate the premises as well the llord he immediately reclaims his property to make sure the house is secure the tenant has arrived  is  shock she had been rentg the house was seven years a sgle mother to a grownup daughter she works but as frequently struggled to make ends meet she has to pick up her belonggs the next day otherwise everythg will go to the junkyard at her expense it's just gonna be easy on you like the vehicle to send a backyard or whatever if you haven't removed because if he has a tow company remove it  that's an added expense that you'd be lookg at do you thk all this is a bit harsh do I thk it's harsh now you got to do we gotta do it I gotta do what I gotta do what are you gonna do where am I gonna sleep deep  the whole thg about needs yeah I can yeah have a good day she's immediately rendered homeless no room for negotiation this is the only way that's up to her if that's the only way she said she would move before this didn't move maybe she had nowhere to go you know she never did say that to me there are around 10 evictions just like this one every day  Richmond as a consequence  this fasttrack justice budget hotels on the outskirts  the city have become a refuge for those who've been kicked out  their homes some people stay there for a very long time among them is David a 38 year old gardener david has lived  this motel sce his eviction two years ago at the weekend the divorced father's children come to stay over  his oneroom home which cost him 1300 it is our bedroom livg room family room every room this is a little kitchen which I cooked her eggs last night  made hamburgers so I a't cleang the dishes you know we hung out played video games  bathroom you know got a shower but um that's about all durg the week David shares this sgle room which has packed with household utensils  personal possessions with his new partner for two years here oh man I'm not cramped you know like obviously if you put two people  the same room for a long enough time it's theirs you're gonna bump heads  have arguments  stuff his girlfriend has a stable job  the surance busess they could buy a bigger  less expensive apartment yet they rema trapped  this ty room because their past eviction contues to haunt them but at the time she was she was tryg at first  then I'm what you get so beat down by gog to places  stuff  them not they're not givg you a place because they're like oh you had an eviction it's you know shows that you didn't pay just like two months or somethg like that  it defitely was a detriment to it you know there was no way  gettg anywhere it's almost unthkable  many parts  the world but here llords are able to access the past  bad tenants with a few simple clicks a systematic surveillance system that has been denounced by Mart vague bright a lawyer  defense attorney for tenants so this database is a public database I mean anyone can go on to this database  look at it  you can search by name so let's try a common common American name here we go Oh Mary Gillespie okay there we go  you can see five unlawful detaers let's see ten years ago this tenant had a series  late payments despite beg small amounts  this case under $300 they can have grave consequences so if I'm a llord I can look at that  say well that was 10 years ago but I thk she's too much  a risk I don't want to rent to her if anythg bad happens to you whether it's you know you get your hours cut back at work whether you break an ankle  you're f work for a month whether you got that car repair bill or that hospital bill or anythg that just throws your budget f slightly you better catch up real quick or you're gonna have a judgment  possession agast you  get addicted so the tenant really is livg under the sword  damocles David is far from an isolated case six thous three hundred people are evicted across the US every day  the city fdg accommodation is the chief source  anxiety but there's a region where for some the ma worry is simply beg able to put food on the table welcome to rural America the Appalachian Mountas region that spans several states  the eastern part  the country [] Appalachia was once widely known for its coal production these days almost all  the mes are closed it's ten said that the American dream got lost somewhere along the way here [] the Appalachia region with the predomantly white population is home to some  the poorest counties  the entire country [] durg the summer at lunchtime this food truck travels up  down the disadvantaged areas  Roanoke Luz  Stacy are two

are unemployed they receive 1200 euros  welfare a month but as a family  five it's barely enough to live on well try to get  at least two to three but towards the end  the month when the stamps run low maybe I usually skip breakfast  lunch  yeah breakfast or lunch  then I eat dner so that's yes beg poor to the pot  starvg this reality is nothg new  the Appalachia region durg his 196 election campaign lyndon b johnson visited Appalachia  was horrified by the poverty he saw after his reelection he launched a master plan to put an end to poverty  now declares unconditional war on poverty  America one  his ideas was to create food stamps coupons given free  charge to the poor to this day the government distributes these food stamps to 0 million American people  this mobile home park

tight budget before gog shoppg the two women check the balance on their card Sarah Nia  Jennifer can spend their food coupons  any supermarket like this discount store where they regularly go shoppg once at the checkout the food stamp card works just like any other credit card   this store  Appalachia they are by no means the only ones who use one how many people be with food stamps here probably have two it's a lot yeah yeah thank you Donald Trump plans to cut down on the amount  food stamp recipients critics say that risks makg an already vulnerable Society even poorer [] but ironically here they voted 80%  favor  Trump  their support for him contues seemgly unabated to earn a little extra cash Serena does household chores for her neighbours for a few dollars she also cuts James's hair he works  a me  is a loyal Trump follower I am yeah I do support Trump why because you've done everythg he said he'd that you know Trump is willg to help other countries but his country comes first that's not I haven't been a long time Donald Trump is a billionaire Donald Trump keeps his family everywhere he goes his children his wife were everywhere with you that tells you a lot about a person that unwaverg support can be difficult to underst for outsiders because sce Trump's election everyday life for dividuals  Appalachia has not improved poverty is pervasive here  has led to some strange developments  the middle  the night  this small town dozens  cars enter a show ground sold out ok I suggest that you be back here about three or four o'clock well it kd  drips you out cuz it makes you thk you it's like it's everybody's led up like you're gog to a concert  you get learns to keep you keep your daughter stuff it you know what these people are gatherg for here on mass is simply to see a doctor because every year here for a weekend a nonprit organization arranges free consultations oh there's the huge name a lot  their families  this area are the workgclass families they're strugglg to choose between payg for medice that can save their life or you know groceries for the week so it's it's a shame to have to do it this way but you got to take care  your people  these are our people

part [] you know wasn't weapon for you what what do you know we're gonna be for 2 hours these high school students are gog to live eat  sleep  a roleplayg scenario much like 20 or so other participants all from middle class backgrounds each  them has paid 60 euros to participate Janet Darrell came up with the idea 25 years ago with her husb a pastor the remarkable simulation project has so far had 30,000 participants the goal is to create compassionate care for humanity  poverty everybody can get the American Dream but when you're trapped  poverty  the cycles  poverty Janet Terrell says  order to  experience the life  a homeless person you have to start by lookg like them  this secondh store participants are encouraged to dress  appropriate clothes jeans but I thk that Skeeter's f  my ankles so that I'm happy about that right now it doesn't seem like too much  a challenge but thgs are gog to get more complicated with the secondstage sleepg out  the open will be it not  the streets but  a secured fenced f yard 53 year old martyr however is slightly concerned I'm scared  bugs she thought long  hard before signg up it was her husb who convced her to take part he doesn't look like real on this situation right right yes yes it doesn't smell like poop it doesn't smell like ure there's a rat runng everywhere yeah no this is defitely luxury homelessness yeah a fact that is a comfort nonetheless although it won't be a very long night at 6 o'clock the next day janitor L gives everyone a wakeup call  they don't look particularly wellrested it's not real unless situation  their safe they're savg them beg on the street but this is not as safe as beg  the home with their family so it just gives them a little bit more reality  what livg  the environment does on your body so by tonight it takes about 2 hours to really start gettg the idea that this this could be really rough for the next stage  the program the participants are sent to downtown Waco their task today is to fd somethg to eat from their own  without any money [] you can smell the food so should should I ask this guy cannot beg for silly people at restaurant like  many other cities  the US beggg is a punishable fense it's also forbidden to rummage through garbage bs oh there's no food  there there's city property  reclaimg anythg at all from them is considered stealg  order to survive the homeless  Wako are therefore forced to break the law our two participants are not gog to fd anythg to eat  after two hours  walkg the streets  0 degrees heat marta feels fat she calls her husb to pick her up but I feel like I feel like I'm too weak well we're gonna shoot like I'm too old  fat  I can't do it you've learned somethg about yourself  what it would like what would be like to be homeless at your age yeah  be hard is the us  ready to face up to poverty while the president claims America has never been so great forty million  tramps fellow citizens are still caught  the clutches  poverty []

billions every year thanks to low terest rates if you just open a savgs account it's almost like burng money this deluge  money has created deals worth billions companies are bought  sold for vast sums because loans are cheap the employees become the pawns  the speculators the question is where's all this money gog [] [] we're  bud Borden Dauphe western germany this couple faces the same dilemma as many others what to do with their savgs  this world  low terest rates karlhez eyes a recently retired court bailiff knows all about money  debts his life surance policy is due to pay out

that paid high returns but were risky he never thought it would come to this he doesn't know what to do with terest rates this low  nor do his friends some have told me they won't keep their money  a bank account anymore stead they'll deposit it as physical cash  a safe [] it's fairly worth gog to the bank terest on savgs is almost zero at just 0.01 percent that means that he gets one cent for every hundred euros per year what's happeng with his money [] people are worried says the director at the local branch  Volks Bank Elmar Schmitz although there hasn't been a run on the safe deposit boxes yet there have been more requests to keep money  cash or gold sce we've seen a contug fall  terest rates over the past eight years I need a crystal ball to tell you whether it'll stay like this for long I thk we'll have this situation for another two or three years after that thgs will change aga but we won't have the terest rates we had ten or twenty years ago it seems  the India puts  Spanish  a magaze hub the manager knows who he blames for these low terest rates the European Central Bank the remit  the ECB is clear price stability it uses the base rate as its tool to deliver that  it's been lowerg the base rate steadily ever sce the fancial crisis down to zero savers are left by the wayside but countries with high levels  debt such as Greece are able to get their hs on cheap money so too can a lien banks  southern Europe the cheap money is supposed to fuel growth by buyg government bonds the ECB has pumped additional trillions  euros to the markets otherwise the system would face potential collapse the price  all this is a deluge  money the money has to go somewhere to shares  real estate which contued to rise  price the result is a massive concentration  wealth right at the top Bill Gates the world's richest man has a fortune  65 billion euros that's the market value  his shares to compare the total value  all  the world's cash is less than 100 times that amount five trillion euros the value  all goods  services created every year around the world is 75 trillion euros that's the real economy the world's debts are far higher than that state's busesses  private dividuals all have debts a world livg on credit 705 trillion that's the value  only derivatives the speculative fancial bets on the future they've got almost nothg to do with real goods any more to recap this is the fortune  Bill Gates [] what happens when there's too much money  the world economist max otter says this deluge  cheap money isn't just floodg the big banks he sees low terest rates as the symptom  a massive sickness  the global fancial system what's more cheap money endangers the entire economy  promotes creasg levels  debt he says those who believe that with the fancial crisis  2008 recedg thgs are now better aga are much mistaken this flux  money is extremely dangerous it's slow but at some pot the dam will burst  then we'll be  a huge crisis the biggest danger is that this flood  cheap money will split our society it moves money from the bottom upwards he says a gigantic redistribution mache [] low terest rates are demed by many economists they mean that states can borrow on the cheap states can take on more debt it also means the rich can do the same  ten without any liability if they default if I as one  the superrich buy a busess they're not only liable to the extent  my holdg not with the rest  my wealth that's a blatant justice compared to middle class families  regular people with home construction this flood  money doesn't just save States  banks it also favors the rich who use this cheap money to buy shares companies  real estate with rapidly risg values while the fancial vestments  ordary people lose value the middle the middle classes have savgs  surance policies  these vestments are the losers  a low terest rate world armen poorest citizens suffer because real estate prices are gog up  therefore rents to either stagnant  one RT Midls like Londyn the world's largest fancial center illustrates very clearly the effect  this monetary deluge trillions are traded here 300,000 employees  the fancial sector are tryg to turn money to even more money London's own real estate prices are skyrocketg all the major banks have fices here this is where the money  the world's rich is vested Roman borisovitch knows the scene well there are neighborhoods where millionaires are beg pushed out by billionaires borisovitch is fightg agast a sellf  the City  London to speculators together with colleagues he has researched the anonymous owners  several properties as a former banker he's familiar with price developments well these are views houses  aga dependg on the size it's difficult to say how deep they are but anywhere between three to five maybe five to seven million on this on this pitch  this particular area five to seven million pounds now if you thk about Mews houses this is a family place thk about what kd  family can afford to buy a house for three to five four even for five to serve seven million pounds the expensive houses are all speculative objects  empty London belongs to vestors who don't live  the city roman borisovitch discovered that this townhouse was sold to a ukraian billionaire for 66 million pounds [] on paper the mansion is owned by a shell company right now there is an excess  0,000 properties  London that are owned by anonymous fshore corporations meang that we don't know who the owners it could be decent people they could be mafia there are four we suspect that a lot  this money that came through London that it exploded prices here is actually  dirty orig there's construction underway everywhere speculatg with real estate is the big game  town trillions  euros from Russians Germans Chese  Indians have poured to London from socioeconomical perspective it is not sustaable you cannot have a city where a residents  workers cannot cannot live you know this this is a this is what the problem with bubbles is that nobody knows when they're gonna burst but London doesn't have a monopoly on real estate bubbles they now exist  cities around the world if a realestate bubble were to burst sure it would hit the wealthy you are vested there but they have a diverse vestment portfolio they seize opportunities around the world if the realestate bubble  Munich were to burst they'll be  Rio or Tokyo they can act globally but the middle class can't as seen  the fancial crisis  2008 the middle class is hit while the rich get richer  times  boom  bust not much has changed the mor regulations troduced to the fancial sector aren't very tangible here  London the speculators are lookg for new ways to make more money  the world's number one fancial center many transactions are now takg place  the shadow bankg system the bonuses the lucrative deals are as plentiful as ever  brexit will see the regulations relaxed even further the show must go on f Townsend has lived through it all he's been drivg a taxi for 5 years chauffeurg bankers  brokers around the city dealg  the world's trillions has become the trump card  the British economy he says

some leave the city entirely  forever gerund Anderson was one  London's fancial stars he now lives  Wales he paid the same for his farm as he would have to pay for a ty sgle room apartment  downtown London but that's not the only reason why he came here he's had enough  the fancial excesses the city is full  greedy ruthless clever people  if they put bit more regulation a little bit more compliance some restrictions these guys work out how to game the system to make sure that it benefits them today he writes novels  screenplays about the fancial world he used to earn a few hundred thous pounds a year he didn't care who the trades heard that's a few years ago now but nothg has changed says Anderson the system rewards those who make fat deals at the expense  others I make lots  strange Gamble's credible reckless decisions but they come good then I make huge amounts  money if they go bad maybe I lose my job but that's the only downside so this is what it's called an asymmetrical risk it encourages shortterm gamblg Anderson is certa that the fancial system will keep growg  sprawlg the prospects  big prits the low terest rates the deluge  money the former fancial  believes these elements make for an explosive mix the Ponzi system that exists is such that organizations are just borrowg large amounts  money from each other  then usg that to make money by lendg it to others who are usg that to lend it to others which means that you have a system where ultimately no one's really got the money that backs up all the money that's beg lent out subsequently when that system comes crashg down then it's good night attacks on speculative fancial transactions could slow this merrygoround however this fancial transactions tax would need to be troduced globally but even the smallscale version with just 10 new states failed after years  negotiations even though German Fance Mister Wolfgang Scheidler personally pushed for this tax but Brita was agast it  will be even more agast it  the future London as a fancial center would suffer that's most regrettable because this tax would be the necessary surgery for the sick fancial system the ECB  other central banks floodg the world with cheap money isn't a cure it's just pa relief   the long run it has serious side effects the entire setup is a system that keeps savg itself temporarily but at some pot it will evitably fall apart until then it accessor baits the enormous justice that already exists those who have benefit a hful  super rich dividuals own as much as the poor a half  the world's population combed this flood  money is creasg the gap between rich  poor even further people like these are strugglg at the hs  low terest rates karlhez Aish  his friends are worried  the past the world was a veritable paradise for savers the economy was boomg  terest rates were high even if flation was  nevertheless successive generations lived by the motto those who save get more out  life  the past you could rely on a certa terest rate for your savgs account you could live with that  the 70s we got a fixed rate  7% for a short while we got 11% karlhez i has an appotment with his fancial advisor at the bank what should he do with his money we have this account  next year a life surance policy will mature for huge what can we do with this money the adviser wants to know about her clients readess to take risks he's actually more riskaverse  wants to vest his surance money as broadly as possible every day it sits  the savgs account it loses purchasg power  he knows that davia goy calluses sce you're gettg almost no terest we have to see where we can generate a return  that means stocks  chairs vestg more  property bonds  chairs that's what his bank advises what else can he do  times like these I don't feel uneasy or really comfortable with the idea although I've generally had positive experiences to date shares property bonds higher risk whether he likes it or not karlhez edge has to participate  the game  the big fancial world it's an dustry  party mood big companies are buyg up competitors thanks to low terest rates thereby creasg their share value only shareholders benefit from their strategy  they tend to be affluent German chemical giant buyer bought American seed supplier Monsanto for example for 65 billion euros [] the world's largest brewery anheuserbusch InBev

Mart Porsche Co hoped thgs would fally get better aga he's on his way to a wmf Works meetg on behalf  the IG Metall labor union he thks it's symptomatic  today's age how easily a deal worth billions

today that the new buyers do not tend to cannibalize wmf further before sellg it on but union representative Mart pushka knows the only way such deals can be paid for is through extremely low terest rates on loans the dealer wmf went as follows new yorkbased equity firm KKR bought wmf for around 660 million euros via a subsidiary located  a tax haven KKR used 100 million  their own capital  borrowed five hundred  sixty million from banks four years later KKR sold wmf to French household equipment maker sed for 1.6 billion a deal supported by very low terest rates KKR made a prit  ne hundred  forty million euros after repayg the loan  vestg just a hundred million  its own capital that's a return  more than eight hundred percent a lucrative deal but only for KKR shareholders that's possible because at the moment there's enough money on the global market other vestors are able to pay such prices if the money weren't there they wouldn't be able to shift such volumes loans for almost nothg that's the flipside  the money deluge fancial vestors do deals with huge sums that would have been unthkable  the past  a regulated fancial system today many wish for a return to those times the deregulation  the fancial world has a long history [] until 1971 the world was fancially stable currencies were covered by gold the real economy was imbalance with the amount  money available then u.s. President Nixon needed money for the Vietnam War he switched on the money prtg mache not least because OPEC had creased oil prices this money then flooded the world banks came up with new vestment models they now wanted to make money not with goods but with money alone this was the start  the fancial dustry  today credit cards  current accounts accelerated fancial transactions former public responsibilities were privatized pensions are a case  pot the private sector is better at everythg than the state so they said new billions came to play  the 1980s Margaret Thatcher deregulated the banks  London Bill Clton did the same later on   Chancellor Gerhard schröder  Germany then also bought to the deregulation philosophy money was to earn money  thereby create growth the global caso was open for busess path  liberalisation was a mistake it's the wrong word  if you deregulate markets that need to be regulated then you create chaos you unleash an avalanche  money onto the world you can call that liberalisation but it was a policy that benefited only a few people namely the rich it has caused a lot  problems for the world  the liberalisation or deregulation allowed the deals  the banks to explode they now acted ternationally major banks have become vestment establishments that fund huge deals more  more money goes to speculation that's where the big money is made this has less  less to do with the real economy  the central bank's alone responsible for this flux  money or where does it all come from economic students  Zenon Germany are vestigatg just that what do people know about the orig  money that's what they want to fd out we're from the   Zagan were dog a research project about money what does money mean to you you can't do anythg without money where does the money come from not from me that's for sure how was money made through work  course I'm not sure  banks by the state I couldn't tell you the responses were soberg is that zero it was really varied a lot  people had no response at all some said the bank or that it's just prted  some mentioned manipulation most had no idea for years fancial expert he'll get poked at has been annoyed that money plays almost no role  economics many consider it just  neutral means  exchange it's  the course  macro discuss an issue  a strange that it's not just the public who are  the dark the students  survey demonstrated that well enough but the money creation process also seems to be somethg  a mystery among academics  even  the bankg boardrooms the banks are silent for a reason they would have to expla to their customers that these days it's them creatg the money  them benefitg hugely as a result as Poquette explas money isn't neutral after all it's not the central banks but private banks that generate most  this new money a process also known as deposit money creation get contued very money is created when someone goes to a bank to take out a loan the bank opens an account  issues the funds its then  a contract with the dividual who's taken out the loan the bank hopes that person will pay it back someday that means what the origal impulse to create money comes from private banks that's new to most people many thk alone works like this savers take money to the bank  the bank loans this money to a customer such as someone buyg a house or runng a busess but that's not the case if someone has savgs their money is parked  a savgs account the advantage for the bank is that person can't just take it out when the bank issues alone it's created from nothg these two processes really don't have anythg to do with each other even though it looks that way  even though that's what the textbooks are say this is how it works a customer wants to take out a loan for ten thous euros the bank has to deposit between one  three percent so at least a hundred euros with the central bank that's it  return the bank is allowed to transfer ten thous euros to the customers account at the push  a button the bank generates ten thous euros  electronic money from a hundred euros   return it collects the terest this creation  deposit money is a license to make money the bank is an additional the banks are happy  course that they can do this because that gives them a free re they get to keep the prits the senior age that's a few billion every year who'd want to miss out on that that's defitely not them private banks basically create new money as they wish that used to be the privilege  the mt  prces  governments it's a privilege to create money  therefore prits out  nothg this privilege has been  the hs  the fancial dustry for a long time   recent years it's been unchecked is that really such a good idea for this the big banks  particular have massively creased the money deluge  this way as a way  imposg more controls on the fancial system aga private banks could be deprived  the privilege  creatg money developments are already underfoot  Switzerl Zurich is a popular location with banks there's an itiative here that advocates reg  the Swiss banks  future it says only the ional Bank should be allowed to create money not private banks anymore the itiative is

everywhere we  the future generation  beg robbed at the moment it's primarily the big banks who are pocketg the prits  this moneymakg enterprise the Swiss itiative wants these billions to benefit the country's citizens by only allowg the ional Bank to create money we want to take away the right  banks to create money but we're not takg away a le  busess they'll still be allowed to lend money  manage assets  the oversea fancial transactions the banks get to keep all  that they want their ional Bank to play a key role  the future [] private banks would only be allowed to issue loans if they have the money  their vaults 100% secure private banks would not be allowed to create deposit money anymore  the prits from this privilege would also benefit the ional Bank the general public are the wners the ional Bank is obligated to look after their wellbeg the group want the creation  money to be state controlled  not  the hs  private banks billions  terest payments would then flow to the public purse I support these various itiatives banks wouldn't be able to create new money they'd have to work with the money they have  deposits that's a good first step it's not enough but it's an important step on the path towards a fair fancial systems ten beats I don't feel good system it appears absurd on the one h the world is flooded with cheap money but at the same time some places have

central issue for young entrepreneurs they can't get their hs on any  this cheap money at the end  the day it's not about money but about creatg opportunities so that people who want to do somethg can do somethg if you don't vest  that or the startups can't access money easily  can't develop easily then they'll move country there are lots  entrepreneurs here who want to push forward sustaable

likely to lead to the next disaster we need a different system but it would be enough if we just returned to what we had highly regulated fancial markets  a bankg sector under control  whose purpose

that envisage by the Swiss itiative could be one buildg block  particular states have to reduce their massive debts it's the only way we can curb this deluge  money  break through the spiral  loans that's also why we need ternational debt conferences where states mutually waive their debts it's ask the people they foot the bill big banks must cover their loans with more  their own capital than they do today there needs to be a global tax on fancial transactions  money needs to go to places where it benefits society for our futures sake [] the terests  the fancial dustry have determed

YOU WATCH THE WEATHER CHANNEL, THEY GO THIS MODEL SAYS THAT, THAT MODEL SAYS THAT, WE THINK THIS ONE IS WORKING THE BEST, WE\'RE GOING TO RELY ON THAT. WELL, FOR CLIMATE FORECAST SHOULD BE USING THE RUSSIAN MODEL BUT WE\'RE NOT. WE USE THIS BIG SPATE OF ALL THE OTHER MODELS THAT HAVE THE WARMING THAT\'S NOT OCCURRING. MARK: WHY ARE THE OTHER MODELS, 31 OF THEM, WRONG. AND WHY DO THEY ALL GO THE SAME DIRECTION, UP? >> BECAUSE, THEY WHAT ARE IS CALLED PARAMETERIZED. THEY\'RE ALL PARAMETERIZED, CAN I TRANSLATE PARAMETERIZED IN ENGLISH? FUDGE. THEY DON\'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER, DON\'T KNOW THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR CERTAIN PHENOMENA, SO WE ESSENTIALLY PUT IN CODE STEPS THAT GIVE US WHAT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE. AND SYSTEMATIC ERROR THAT WAS MADE WAS THE MODELS WERE TUNED, AS IT SAID. TUNED. TUNED TO SIMULATE THE WARMING OF THE EARLY 20th CENTURY. BEGAN IN 1910, ENDED IN 195, ABOUT .5 DEGREES CELSIUS. MARK, THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY CARBON DIOXIDE. MARK: BECAUSE THERE WASN\'T ENOUGH. >> WE HAD TO PUT ENOUGH IN THAT THE BACKGROUND CARBON DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION IS 280 MILLION PARTS PER MILLION. WHEN THE FIRST WARMING STAR, 208 PARTS PER MILLION. IF IT IS THAT SENSITIVE TO 18PPM CHANGE IN CO2 WE WOULDN\'T BE TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW AND WE\'D BE SWEATING BULLETS. >> SO WHAT YOU\'RE SAYING IS MAN MADE CARBON DIOXIDE THE LAST CENTURY COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED  >> EARLY 20th CENTURY. MARK: COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED THIS HEAT. SO WHAT DID? DO WE KNOW? >> NO. AND THREE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS IN LIFE MAY NOT BE I LOVE YOU. IT MAY BE I DON\'T KNOW. I DON\'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT KICKED OFF THAT WARMING. THERE\'S LOTS OF THEORIES. ONE IS THAT IT WAS THE FINAL ESCAPE FROM A GOLD PERIOD, MULTICENTURY PERIOD KNOWN AS THE LITTLE ICE AGE. THAT\'S THE PLAUSIBILITY, WHY DID IT HAPPEN THEN. BUT WE DON\'T HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THAT. BECAUSE WE FORCED THE COMPUTER MODELS TO SAY, HUMAN INFLUENCE, CO2 AND OTHER STUFF. WE MADE THE MODELS TOO SENSITIVE, AND SO THAT\'S WHY WHEN YOU GET TO THE LATE 20th CENTURY, ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY\'RE WARMING UP LIKE CRAZY AND THE REALITY IS DOWN HERE. IT WAS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN. THIS WAS REVEALED IN SCIENCE MAGAZINE IN LATE 2016, AND THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED BY A FRENCH CLIMATE MODELER CALLED THE ART AND SCIENCE OF CLIMATE MODEL TUNING. AND IN IT, HE SPEAKS OF PARAMETERIZING. WE COULD SAY FUDGING, THE MODELS TO GIVE, HIS WORDS, AN ANTICIPA ACCEPTABLE RANGE OF RESULTS. SO IT\'S THE SCIENTIST, NOT THE SCIENCE THAT\'S DETERMINING HOW MUCH IT\'S GOING TO WARM. LOT OF PEOPLE DON\'T KNOW THIS, BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE, AND YOU KNOW, WE COULD SPECULATE AS TO WHY THAT PAPER WAS PUBLISHED RIGHT BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION? I WOULDN\'T WANT TO IMPUTE CAUSATION, BUT GEE  MARK: BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT CAUSATION. >> SURE. MARK: HAVE YOU 31 GOVERNMENTS. >> THE 31 DIFFERENT MODELS. >> 31 DIFFERENT MODELS. MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTS. >> RIGHT. MARK: FUDGING THE NUMBERS? >> NOT FUDGING THEM PARAMETERIZING. MARK: YOU USED THE WORD FUDGING. DOES OUR EPA DO THAT? DOES  DO THAT? WHO DOES THAT FOR US? >> GOOD QUESTION, MARK, BECAUSE THE EPA WAS TOLD BY THE SUPREME COURT IN 2007 THAT IF IT FOUND THE CARBON DIOXIDE ENDANGERED HUMAN HEALTH AND WELFARE, THAT IT HAD THE POWER TO REGULATE IT UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. MARK: THIS IS THE MASSACHUSETTS. >> THE EPA. WELL, THEY PRODUCED AN ENDANGERMENT FINDING, 2009, AND THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING FOR PROSPECTIVE CLIMATE IS 100%, I DIDN\'T SAY 90%. I SAID 100% BASED ON THOSE MODELS. SO IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THOSE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY ARE NOT WORKING, YOU CAN TAKE DOWN THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING, AND THAT WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR ALL THOSE POLICIES THAT CAME OUT OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. MARK: WHICH WOULD MEAN YOU DON\'T GET TO REGULATE  >> ABSOLUTELY. MARK:  CARBON DIOXIDE. >> ABSOLUTELY, THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING IS THE HEART OF THE MATTER. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW GUNG HO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS ON THIS ISSUE. IF YOU LISTEN TO HIS FIRST INAUGURAL SPEECH, JANUARY 20, 2009, IT\'S SECOND SUBSTANTIVE PARAGRAPH OF THE SPEECH IS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, AFTER HEALTH CARE. 90 DAYS AFTER HE FINISHED THAT SPEECH, HIS EPA PRODUCED A PRELIMINARY FINDING OF ENDANGERMENT FROM CARBON DIOXIDE. THEY WERE WORKING ON THIS BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT, BUREAUCRATS CAN\'T WORK THAT FAST, AND THEN THE FINAL FINDING WAS MADE IN DECEMBER FOR THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN COPENHAGEN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE ANOTHER GLOBAL WARMING. MARK: SO YOU\'RE TELLING US THAT WE HAVE A MASSIVE BIT OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT HAS ENORMOUS EFFECT ON SOCIETY THAT\'S BUILT ON  I\'LL USE MY WORDS, PHONY MODELS. >> BUILT ON A HOUSE OF CARDS. MODELS REALLY DON\'T WORK. IF I COULD REALLY BE ARCANE, I COULD EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM AS TO WHY THEY DON\'T WORK. MARK: AS LONG AS I UNDERSTAND IT. >> THE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY PREDICT THAT AS YOU GO UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE TROPICS WHICH ARE 0% OF THE EARTH THAT THE TEMPERATURE SHOULD RISE DRAMATICALLY AS YOU GO FURTHER UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE. SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE LEVEL OF THE JET STREAM, THE COMPUTER MODELS ARE PREDICTING SEVEN TIMES. I DIDN\'T SAY SEVENTENTHS OF A DEGREE, I SAID SEVEN TIMES MORE WARMING THAN BEING OBSERVED. WHY AM I BORING YOU WITH THAT? THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE DETERMINES PRECIPITATION, AND GUESS WHAT? ALMOST ALL THE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE THAT WE HAVE AROUND US TODAY IN THE HUMID WASHINGTON, D.C., THAT COMES FROM THE TROPICS. SO IF YOU GET THAT VERTICAL MOTION WRONG, DOWN THERE, YOU GET ALL THE SUBSEQUENT VARIABLES WRONG. IT\'S A FANTASTIC SYSTEMATIC ERROR, AND AGAIN, THAT ALONG WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE RATHER THE LOWER ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES THAN WHAT\'S BEING OBSERVED, THAT\'S SUFFICIENT TO THE CHEMICAL FINDING. MARK: TO THE AVERAGE PEDESTRIAN LIKE ME, IF YOU GET THAT WRONG, WHAT DOES IT MEAN? YOU GET THE WEATHER MODELS WRONG? >> THE SUBSEQUENT WEATHER WRONG. THAT\'S WHY, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE FAMILIES OF MODELS, THEY PREDICT RADICALLY DIFFERENT CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION FROM MODEL TO MODEL. WELL, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY GOT THE PRECIPITATION INITIALIZATION OUT OF TROPICS WRONG. PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT. I OFFER YOU WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA, IF AN EXAMPLE PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT COMING FROM THE TROPICS, GET THAT WRONG AND YOU GET THAT THING. >> IS WEATHER GETTING WORSE? >> NO. I LOVE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT. ROGER PILKE, JR., AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DOES. THIS YES, THERE\'S MORE DAMAGE FROM WEATHER BECAUSE THERE\'S MORE STUFF AND PEOPLE AND PROPERTY IN THE WAY OF WEATHER. SO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT ARE WEATHER DAMAGES AS A PERCENT OF GDP. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY, THERE\'S NOTHING WHATSOEVER. I\'M SURE HURRICANES ARE GETTING WORSE. I HEARD THAT ON EVERY LEGACY NETWORK DURING FLORENCE AND HARVEY AND ALL THAT STUFF. WELL, FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THERE\'S A GUY BY THE NAME OF RYAN MAUI, A HOT SHOT YOUNG TROPICAL METEOROLOGIST, AND A SCHOLAR AT THE CATO INSTITUTE. HE TRACKS THE ENERGY IN THE TROPICAL CYCLONES. SINCE WE GOT GLOBAL RECORDS THAT BEGAN IN 1970, AND YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT INTEGRA ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING AFTER ALL, IT\'S ONLY LOGICAL.  PRESIDENT GORE SAYS THAT MUST BE THE CASE. IT\'S NOT. THERE\'S NO RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THE ACCUMULA CYCLONE ENERGY AND THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH. IT\'S JUST NOT THERE. NOW, WHAT  WAIT A MINUTE, J DOES OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THIS? THEY SAID IT IN THEIR LAST REPORT CALLED GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNI STATES. THEY SAID, OH, THERE\'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HURRICANE POWER IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN FROM 1970 TO 2009 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 1980 TO 2009. WAIT A MINUTE. WHY DID YOU STOP IN 2009. IT\'S 201 REPORT. BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE DATA AFTER 2009, THE INCREASE GOES BACK TO WHERE IT WAS. WHY DID YOU START IN THE MID 1970s, BECAUSE WE HAVE RECORDS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD BACK TO 1920. IF YOU LOOK AT 1920 TO 1950, YOU SEE AN INCREASE THAT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT OCCURS. MARK: SO THE INFORMATION THEY\'RE PROVIDING US  >> IS SKEWED. IT\'S SKEWED. THEY\'RE CHERRY PICKING. MARK: HERE WE RELY ON THE CLIMATOLOGISTS AND THEY ARE HYPERPOLITICAL. TONIGHT GET BACK TO THAT AS SOON AS WE RETURN. >>> DON\'T FORGET, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU CAN WATCH LEVIN TV ALMOST EVERY WEEK NIGHT BY"

have been circulatg before it was first identified evidence has emerged  France  a positive case  late December  days before  reported a cluster  cases  pneumonia  unknown cause  Wuhan the case  France came to light after a hospital there retested frozen blood samples from patients who had pneumonia like symptoms  one  those tests came back positive for kov 19 the  Health Organization is now urgg other countries to retest old blood samples  from suspicious cases Redman Shannon has our top story tonight i'm Arusha Mar looks back at a video  his time  tensive care  late December I thought it was the flu he told French news channel bfmtv he had a cough a headache  fever but recovered  was discharged on December 29th two days later  first reported cases  pneumonia  an unknown cause on January 23rd the epicenter city  Wuhan was locked down  a day after that the first case was confirmed  Europe a French citizen who had been to  the virus has sce killed tens  thouss  Europe  April a French hospital decided to retest samples taken from 1 patients who were tested for pneumonia  December  January it was a volume get the positive or covetousness Novell said this altameyer sample was the only one that tested positive a backup test confirmed the fdg it potentially changes the entire modellg for how covert 19 spread particularly because the 2 year old hadn't even been to  it's not surprisg that's important because the given the earliest cases  copán 19 had symptoms all said already  early December so it's possible that some  the fected people traveled from Wuhan to other countries at that time the  Health Organization now wants other countries to go back  test  there's always a opportunity I thk to sort  go back further even the to test samples we haven't actually as as I know it discussed that as yet but that is potentially   terest so we can defitely take a look at that pressor Luke O'Neill is workg on a treatment for covert 19 he's reservg judgment until other tests show the virus was outside    December  science you might call a wacky results you gotta wonder what's gog on there now one suspicion is the sample was contamated somehow it's a positive sample from January say the results will also be key to the question  the virus's orig somethg that has recently become a political football between Beijg  Washgton Redman Shannon Doble  London there is evidence tonight too that the origal stra  Kovach 19 has mutated to a new more contagious stra the study was done by researchers at the Los amos ional Lab  New Mexico it has not been peer reviewed but

been the domant stra across the world sce midmarch wherever the new stra appeared it quickly fected far more people than the earlier stras that came out  Wuhan  here  Canada Quebec has the most cases  the most deaths  quebec's public health ficer said today they will now go back  vestigate suspicious cases  December  January Quebec has over 33,000 confirmed cases  nearly 2,00 people are known to have died from Kovach 19 that accounts for more than half  Canada's 62,000 cases more than ,000 people  Canada are known to have died there are places though where the curve is flatteng bc reported just eight new cases today the first sgledigit crease  months  new brunswick after gog 16 days without a new case recorded one new one today but it's had no deaths  only 119 cases tonight Ross Lord looks at what lessons others can learn from New Brunswick as the pemic was growg  other parts  Canada New Brunswick went more than two weeks without recordg a sgle new case  covert 19 its a streak no one saw comg  no one can fully expla do you have to have the people you have to have the knowledge it's especially impressive when you compare New Brunswick to its neighbors on April 19th Quebec had just topped 18,000 cases  has sce almost doubled Nova Scotia with a population similar to New Brunswick's had about 700 cases  has sce creased by more than 300 on that same date April 19th New Brunswick at just 118 cases  by the end  Monday that number had not budged markg 16 consecutive days without a positive test even New Brunswick's relatively low rate  testg doesn't account for those differences  course streaks don't last forever so today we have a confirmed a new confirmed case  kovat 19 our first case sce April 18th but all  those 118 year Brunswickers who tested positive have recovered no one has died health researchers credit several decisions an early ban on students returng to class if they've been on March Break outside  Canada early rules on self isolation  closg the provces border  two thgs New Brunswick doesn't have a large urban center  a major ternational airport where you have ternational airports  course there's much more opportunity for that spread to get there  the begng  then contue with the communitybased spread the provce was first to ease social isolation rules  allow 2 households to share the same space but it won't relax border restrictions its banng temporary foreign workers even for farmg  fishg dustries but we need to protect our borders  I mean that's been the whole discussion around the temporary foreign workers it's it's not about it's

Mister Dix  I will be talkg about that  more detail tomorrow but this is the begng  gettg back to a place where our health care system can provide the important services that we all need  depend on we're also gog to be returng to regulated health services like physiotherapy dentistry chiropractors   person counselg I'm happy to say that we will also be reopeng provcial parks for day use gathergs outside  the outside is a good thg physical wellbeg mental wellbeg all our attitude when we get outside  enjoy the splendor  British Columbia but we must do so  a safe manner we can't congregate  large groups when you visit a prevents park do so mdful  the people around you  observe physical distancg dr. Henry's been clear that this physical distancg outside will reduce the likelihood  transmission  the virus  fact the likelihood is very low provided you followed so some BC parks will let's enjoy that but let's stay close to home this is not the time for a road trip to another community for a hike or a holiday if you have a provcial park  your area by all means visit it do not travel great distance produced by WorkSafe BC will support busesses that they take steps towards successful reopeng WorkSafe BC is developg dustry specific guidance to help employers brg workers  customers back safely I want to acknowledge the organizations that are already well to the planng stages like the BC Restaurant Association who is workg on a sector wide plan for the safe reopeng  that dustry  the BC Recreation  Parks Association who are workg to brg back their programs many retailers have already found ways to reopen with no touch payment  Plexiglas barriers these plans take time  what you need to get them right so that workers  consumers can feel safe everybody has to be confident as we move to the new normal we can't just say busesses are open let's come  spend consumers need to be confident that the busesses that they're patronizg have done the hard work to be safe for their workers  their customers we'll also be expg access to child care  class learng for K to 12 students we underst that parents have questions about the safety  their children as they return to school  it's okay for parents to be concerned but I want to reach that many schools are already operatg safely with class learng for the kids  essential workers  we're not gog to be forcg anyone to come back but mister flemg  i will be workg to make sure students whose families need to have kids  class will have that opportunity tunity  we will contue to prepare for the full resumption  classes  September for those that are graduatg  2020  will not be havg a ceremony I regret that very much I hope that there will be ways that we can mark this milestone  the dates ahead  maybe next year we can have that party that you deserve after completg your grade 12 education as we open up we're gog to be dependg on our public transit system which is seeg a ridership decle  the neighborhood  80 to 85 percent we've been dog what we can to improve hygiene  physical distancg on buses   tra  we'll have more to say about that  the days ahead fally we'll be recallg the legislature  the next number  weeks because elected members should be here to do what they can to collaborate on positive outcomes for the people  British Columbia I want to acknowledge the non partisan approach that all members  the legislature have taken to this pot  time  the weeks ahead up is our government house leader Mike fire will be discussg plans for debates about the plans we have to go forward  the ideas the opposition wants to brg to bear so the people  British Columbia can have confidence that our democracy contues to thrive  flourish  these difficult times proceedg to the next step will depend on the outcomes  the path  kovat 19 over the next months we will contue to exp the number  busesses  services that can operate with strict safety protocols if we're dog well  we see more opportunities we'll be openg up more busesses like more parks with campg film  television production is very close movie theaters personal services like spas  hotels phase four won't be enacted until there's a vacce treatments for koban 19 or community immunity has been achieved until these thgs happen BC will not be hostg rock concerts  conventions or any other large gathergs beyond 50 people the success  these plans depend on a number  factors to succeed we're gog  largescale testg rapid identification  contact tracg we're gog to need a hundred percent commitment to physical distancg hwashg  followg the orders  guidance  dr. Henry  BC health ficials we're gog to need to hold the le on borders cludg matory quarante for returng travelers  a time limit on the nan  a limit  course on nonessential travel we're gonna need to build up our healthcare system  work to make sure that we are resilient  the event  a further outbreak  we're gog to need to mata zero tolerance for illness  the workplace if you're sick you must stay home most important to our success we need to come together as a community  as a provce busesses cannot succeed unless we decide to support them the only way they will survive is that people have confidence when they walk through their doors that they will be well  that busess will be well at the same time every part  our provce must be cluded we have to make sure everyone is supported  that we move through this pemic to the restart  the recovery when I heard about people  Asian descent beg pushed to the ground  buildgs beg defaced with anti Chese slogans I was angry hate has no place  British Columbia period we need to st together united agast that type  racism whenever we see it Cob 19 does not discrimate British Columbians shouldn't discrimate either if we're gog to get through this we have to stop fgerpotg put our differences aside  work together to get it done our provce was already  a public health emergency before the spread  Kovan 19 opioid deaths contue to climb  many parts  the provce we must work to brg these deaths down as well climate change contues to be the challenge  our time the wildfire season is startg  the flood season has not yet ended  as we meet all  these challenges we must recommit to puttg clean BC our climate action plan the center  our recovery today we take our first steps there's much more to do but the hard work starts with every step we will do it by contug to support rural  remote communities we will do it by developg partnerships with digenous peoples  workg towards reconciliation  we will do it by makg sure we deliver the support  resources our health care workers need times are tough but they will get better we're gog to get through this  we're gonna come back even stronger together you can build back BC better than ever  someone just to my left to set it very ably all  us need to be kd be calm  be safe we're happy to take some questions star one to get  the queue  unmute your microphones you won't be audible until I call your name we're gonna start f with one question we will get to follow ups a time allowg our first question comes from vendor Sajan hi there I know  hshakg it kd  sounds like now that hubs are on the table so if I'm really careful about it can I hug my mom on Mother's Day very good question if my mom was here I'd want a hugger on Mother's Day but these are choices that you have to make we're not prescribg two British Columbians who they teract with  how they teract with them only to say that the best way to protect everyone is to observe social distancg be sure you're washg your hs regularly but if your circle has been tight  I know bender that your circle is tight I welcome you to hug your mom but people have to make those choices if your mom has got a compromised immune system it's best to keep that distance  we're sayg quite clearly to British Columbians as dr. Henry  Mister Dix have been sayg for over a hundred days now we have a set  rules that we follow we'll all come out  this better  we have been successful as a provce extraordarily successful by comparison to other jurisdictions  the world keepg  md this is a global pemic British Columbians are dog very very well but we can't give up the ground we've made mother's day is comg act responsibly be comfortable with your family keep the gatherg slow  use your common sense our next question is from Bob Palmer good afternoon premier I hear you sgg hold the le on the borders does that mean that the 1day selfisolation requirement will be mataed both at the l border  the Eric Airport arrival  do you have any sense  how long it could be before we reopen the borders for regular crossg with the United States that's a good question  aga as I've said  my remarks  as dr. Henry has directed us with the work  her team at public health is that when we see evidence that the curve is flattens when we see evidence that cases  other jurisdictions are reduced to a place that we're comfortable we'll start to look at openg the borders   the months ahead but at this pot if you're comg to British Columbia for an honesty it has to be for essential service or essential busess  if you do come back from somewhere else  the world  you're gog to be residg  British Columbia you will have to observe a 1day isolation period we're gog to be monitorg that with the federal government for the foreseeable future our next question is from marchello Bernardo a creamier just ask you about regardg the situation volvg voluntary return to schools  childcare I have been speakg to a lot  childcare operators who say that they're worried about beg forced to open up at full capacity or wonderg what safety measures will be  place you mentioned earlier that everythg's gog to be voluntary could you elaborate well one  the thgs that you know the the silver lg  there are numerous silver lgs as I said people the resilience  British Columbians every day I marvel one  the thgs that we focused on as a government when we were sworn  three years ago was developg a universal accessible affordable child care plan  now more than ever is that top  md for British Columbians it has been an imperative for our success as an economy  for the wellbeg  families makg sure that all participants  the family can be part  the economy mostly women have been restricted  their access to the economy because a lack  childcare so we've been dog what we can to build up a very robust system that has been shaken  no doubt  we're gog to contue to work with providers to make sure that they're comfortable make we're gonna contue to work with early childhood educators to ensure that they're practicg physical distancg they're workg with children who are not always as amenable to suggestion based on my experience as a parent  we need to fd ways to work through that but I know ECE s  child care providers are committed to their vocation committed to the children  British Columbia  together we'll get through this next we have Juste hunter a key to this is stayg home if you're sick  I'm wonderg if you've got any further ideas about how your government is gog to support especially those workers who are livg paycheck to paycheck this is an issue that we we've been focused on for quite a few weeks now aga it was you know the urgg  the public health ficer that we ensure that people do not come to the workplace when they're ill one  the significant outbreaks that Mister Dix  dr. Henry spoke about  the poultry sector was a result  people comg to work when they should have stayed home that Shona lights a graphic example  what we needed to address gog forward not just with this pemic but broadly I acknowledged my own weaknesses  this regard havg come to when I should have stayed home over the past couple  years  people are not heroes when they do that they're villas so although when you're a villa you need to make sure you're feedg your family there's ten an economic imperative that's the issue we need to address I've been workg with the federal government Mister James has raised this issue with national fance misters  we're gog to look at whether we evoke worksafe to achieve this whether we use the employment surance programs this is the one that we've been focusg on with the federal fance mister we're gog to fd a way to get there but we have to get there it's imperative to our wellbeg it's imperative to us not just gettg past cope  neteen but makg this part  parcel  how we operate  the workplace next our question is from Sean Eckford Thank You mr. premier I wanted to get back to some comments you made about the upcomg long weekend because as you know  coastal communities that means one question people travelg on the ferries  people are lookg for firm guidance on what is considered an essential trip on BC Ferries this comg long weekend can you go visit your grmother  another town go to your second property that sort  thg now these are very good questions  our direction would be if you don't need to be travellg you shouldn't be travelg that we've been pretty clear on that havg said that as we start to move to the various phases  the restart plan when we get to Phase three later to the summer that might be the better time to get to that second property if you have the good fortune  owng a second property  British Columbia there was a a cab or a cottage you're a tax payer you have property  that community you have a right to be there but aga you also have to acknowledge  recognize the permanent residents  those communities may not have access to acute care facilities may be concerned that the spread  the virus   their community is somethg that they want to avoid  I thk the best course  action would be to stay closer to your home until we get further to the summer we we need to make sure that our see ferry system contues to operate 85% reduction  ridership yearoveryear tells me that that people aren't takg nonessential trips are not an enormous amount  nonessential trips but aga I hope people will exercise their good judgments   not travel to another community to enjoy the long weekend British Columbia every corner  British Columbia is spectacular  my experience  travelg around BC throughout my lifetime wherever you live is an outstg place stay there  enjoy it our next question is from Katie De Rosa hi premier um it was mentioned it's been mentioned  European countries that there is sort  a threshold  cases or transmission rate spikes that would reach rigor lockdowns does BC have a trigger pot for gog back to further restrictions  if so is it perhaps the second wave is comg  the fall what what could be the risk to workers  busesses if there's another shutdown before I asked dr. Henry to respond to that I'll say that British Columbia has been chartg its own course from the begng Mister Dixon  dr. Henry raised alarm bells about Koba 19 long before anyone else was dog so  we were benefited from that as a community  that's why we're where we are today we are now proceedg to the restart plan  as I said we're gog to be dog it cautiously based on the science if we see a spike will respond but dr. henwy will be givg us advice on that so best pass it to her thkg about from the very begng  that's why you know this thoughtful  careful approaches the way we're gog we do not want to be startg  stoppg  startg  stoppg so I believe that this plan  the way we've put it together gives us the tools so that we can crease our contacts our numbers  our safe contacts  a way that keeps us on a steady state for at least the comg months as I've mentioned before we don't know what's gog to happen  the fall we don't know if there's gog to be a resurgence once fluenza  other taury viruses come back so that's why it's so important  part  our plan to make sure that we contue to have the vigilance  the public health system the testg that we need to the contact tracg  we'll be monitorg thgs very carefully but the plan  the thoughtfulness  the purpose that we have is to make sure that we can get through at least until the fall  we see what happens next we have a question from Rob Buffum oh hi premier thank you for your time I guess I just wanted to clarify  terms  the social distancg  broadeng or social circles are people now allowed to do that immediately or as  this weekend or do they need to wait for this weekend  a related question is I'm curious what's the first thg you're gog to do once these restrictions are lifted whether it's gog out  you're huggg someone yeah well I'll let Bonnie take the first part  I'll do the second part yeah not not quite yet please we're tellg you the planng we're workg with people now to get the planng we we had another 23 people who were effective today we have hundreds  people who were followg  public health still so we have a little bit  time we're lookg at the middle  May you know if thgs contue to go if we're dog the same thgs that we're dog  the next week  a half you know by the long weekend is the time that we will be able to go out   hug her family  for our part Rob as a government we take guidance from right across the provce I have a economic recovery task force that represents a crosssection  British Columbians who have been givg me advice I talked to people reggae back tight I feel like I've been on the telephone for sce sce we we announced the pemic back  early March here  British Columbia  what people are sayg to me is they're anxious to get to that next phase but they're also anxious to not give up the ground that we've made so we resisted announcg this plan although we've been workg on it for a month  a half we've resisted announcg this plan because tentimes that's the trigger people go oh good Horgan just said it's time to get back to normal I'm not sayg that I'm sayg we have a plan to move to what will be the new normal  we're gog to be takg guidance along the way from British Columbians people will open up their busesses  if no one shows up it won't be a success we need to make sure that consumers people are comfortable that we are dog everythg we can as a society to protect each other  it's not quite time to get back to regular operatg procedure we have laid out a plan that will go  phases we expect after the Victoria Day long weekend we'll see more busesses see their plans put  place we'll see more doors openg restaurants will start to operate pubs will start to open you can get that haircut provided that we have a good understg  how we can operate these busesses with appropriate physical distancg  safety as the highest priority WorkSafe there to help public health ficers are there to help I thk all busesses want to get gog but they also want people to show up  that means all hangg together  waitg a few more days before we start the real restart plan which will begng after the Victoria Day long weekend Tania Fletcher is next hi premier on the boat les rough timeles for all those thgs you just mentioned you know months  months for specifically busess owners wantg dates now we know sectors will kd  submit dustries specific plans for approval but how quickly can that be expedited  is there confusion  a backlog well many as I said many  our dustries have been operatg admittedly at at reduced speed but through dr. Henry  WorkSafe BC we may mata our construction dustry we we have construction sites whether it's residential construction buildg  schools hospitals roads you name it the what the the part  parcel  buildg British Columbia has been gog on admittedly reduced pace now we can start to look at ratchetg that up but we still have to keep these prciples  place by not shuttg the way other jurisdictions did we stead focused on how can we operate safely we've been successful  we need to contue with that success by ensurg as we look at the dustries  busesses that were closed by order that they are workg with WorkSafe to make sure there's a framework  guidance for them to proceed that make sure that their customers are comfortable that make sure that the health ficers are comfortable  that we don't have an flux  patients comg to our acute care system our next question is from cat's lip Ian what about travel throughout Canada the middle le as people start to move around a bit more than summer well I aga I thk that the market will decide some  this if there are no flights there's not gog to be a lot  people gettg on planes if there are people demg to get on planes there'll be more flights we want to make sure that that's done  a reasonable way I know that the that YVR our major airport  Vancouver has been workg over the past number  weeks to fd ways to safely operate I don't know how many images we've seen tentimes durg holidays certaly at Christmas where airports are packed with people side by side frustrated at the ticket wicket askg where my flight is why did it get cancelled we cannot have that type  behavior that is just not gog to be on so as we start to see more travel aga  the I would suggest probably later  the summer if at all an ternational travel aga will be determed by the number  flights  the number  people that are prepared to get on them these are personal choices that people will have to make we're gog to support them as best we can by makg sure that there are guideles  place for appropriate operation that will keep people safe  will allow the economy to contue to restart  grow to the future up next is Keith Baldry aga not to belabor the pot on timg but mid May I terpret that to mean May 15 if I'm a restaurant owner do I have a reasonable expectation I can open my restaurant  May 15th if I make the changes required under under the sort  the new rules  secondly the kids sports came up  the technical briefg I haven't heard that today I just want to know how you envision kids sports playg out over the summer well I'll start with the back  work work to the front Keith the BC Recreation Association Parks  Recreation Association has been workg to try  fd ways that kids sports  summer camps  all  the thgs that make for an excitg summer for young people can take place  we're gog to be workg with them through public health to see if there's a way that we can see that happeng there's been talk about pressional sports as well that's a different different discussion that volves tentimes people  seats I thk that a local baseball game if people are usg their own equipment they're not sharg equipment  course the bat is the bat but we can try our best to keep the bats clean I thk that we'll see what local community organizations come up with  aga what parents do by showg up with their kids on the the larger question we are gog to be openg provcial parks most spiritual parks for day use on the 1th  May before the long weekends our expectation is that the the restart plan will kick  on the 19th  May which is the Tuesday after the long weekend so I thk that we we wanted to make sure that people had a startg pot to start preparg people have been dog that we've now given a plan we underst how we're gog to operate I'm gog to be askg all members  the legislature to be soundg boards  their community the best way for us to receive formation is through an MLAs fice so if they're a busess that want more details contact your MLA these are gog to be challenges for elected representatives but the nonpartisan approach that we've brought to bear here Mister dicks conductg numerous town halls with opposition members to make sure we're givg the public the formation they need we're gog to contue dog that  the restart will politics reimage BC I'm sure it will for now we want all members  the legislature to be the pot where come where companies small busesses if they can't get access directly to WorkSafe they can't get access directly to public health ficials  course we can start to set that up that's one  the roles  functions  mla's fices they're nonpartisan fices this is one  the tools we'll use to make sure people can access that formation  get their busesses up  runng our next question is from Graham wood hi premier what's your message took quite the worship  can you kd  walk me through the difference between how I can't have more than six people beg my house but plates  worship or a restaurant perhaps could have 9 people well firstly on faithbased gathergs dr. Henry  Mister Dix  I have repeatedly had a number  conversations with faith leaders across the provce multidenomational multifaith discussions   tentimes worship volves gathergs  numerous people whether it's a good whare a temple a synagogue a church we have been sayg to faith leaders  faith leaders have been usg  practicg with their congregations safe physical distancg  still beg connected whether it be through virtual gathergs most temples most churches are large facilities you can have a number  people appropriately distanced you can have multiple services throughout the week there are a whole bunch  ways that dividual faiths will try to address these issues gog forward I don't know how many livg rooms there are  British Columbia where 50 people could gather comfortably but there's certaly restaurants that have a capacity well exceedg that  those restaurants are puttg  place Plexiglas barriers they're movg the number  tables they're spreadg out the number  tables they're workg with their staff they're talkg about regular temperature checks  employees  a host  other issues the notion  wearg nonmedical masks this is gog to be I thk part  parcel  our transit system gog forward but we're still workg those issues we've been pretty clear dr. Henry's been clear a nonmedical mask will not protect you necessarily from koban 19 but it may protect someone else if you happen to be a carrier so we'll be lookg at all  those issues but aga it's a it's a it's a vote common sense if you can't have 50 people jammed to a small space but you could have 9 people spread through a larger space particularly when it comes to thgs like gathergs  particular religions next we have Penny Davos hi there  hearg a lot  the comments that hi can you hear me really loud there have been a lot  fants born  the last couple  months families are really eager to share these new family members with loved ones  I'm just wonderg if you can fer some advice for new parents what they should do  this circumstance everyone wants to cuddle those kids  I just um I hope that you can give us some advice particularly with Mother's Day on the horizon great question you know right now we need to hold the le  we need to keep our our circles small so now's not the time to do that but we are lookg at you know come the end  the middle  May yes if thgs contue to go the risk is low enough  our community but these are the decisions you're gog to have to make if you exp your circle you know that you're gog to be  contacts  their contacts so you need to do it thoughtfully  you need to underst the risk  your family  we do know fants you know are at risk  havg more severe illness we know that we need to protect them from a whole bunch  thgs so absolutely spread your circle but be very aware  be very careful  it's not you you might have to do it   small steps right now next we have Mary Brooke takg my question your data data modelg  your current plans are for people to dog 60% subnormal distancg or 0% cynical distancg   the fe prt it says that this data is stable for about four weeks so what sort  thgs would cause you to impose more restriction on social teraction aga so just to say that this is modelg  that's a caveat because modelg is only good it only reflects what's beg put to it  so it is somethg that has helped us come up with this strategies that we're talkg about so it's a commonsense way it helps us say okay if we are between you know where we are now  we can essentially double our contacts then we'll probably be okay  we'll be contug to follow the models  puttg  our data as we go along so it's not that that's gog to predict what's happeng  what we need to know is that okay that gives a little bit  a sense  what could happen  how can we crease our social connections  crease our economy  get thgs movg aga but stayg with that safety zone so really it's it's not 60 pot or 62 or 9 it's about sayg okay we need to take some some measures to crease our numbers  contacts  the safety  the contacts that we have  that's the way that we can stay  that safe zone we have time for two more questions first Lisa used premier I'm wonderg what your biggest concern is gog forward is it makg sure that people are gog to stay at home when sick is it to have that backup  place for a shift you said people who are workg you know check to check well I have a thous concerns I don't put them  a hierarchy every day all  us have come to work  extraordary circumstances  every day has been a day that we've never experienced before  we've all been dog our best across sectors across communities across the country  fact to try  fd a way to brg unity to brg social cohesion to ensure the health  wellbeg  all British Columbia's  Canadians so those are the those are the primary focuses  that's at the higher level when we get down to the basics I'm concerned that 00,000 British Columbians have applied for the emergency worker benefit program that we've had open for the past five days or six days today 00,000 British Columbians out  work that's a big challenge  it's gog to take time to absorb those workers back to the economy but the good news is before the pemic BC had a robust economy  one  our bigger challenges was fdg workers for jobs so I thk the future is gog to be solid but we need to make sure that future is focused on public health  ensurg that workplaces are safe for workers they're safe for customers  that all British Columbians will benefit a game from a strong  robust economy but we are  uncharted territory   every day we try  fd the best way forward together  we have the benefit  superlative public health ficer a very good friend  those stg Health Mister  a cabet from  a legislature at the present time that is sgularly focused on the best outcomes for British Columbians that I don't thk has ever happened before so we should take some comfort  that our fal question is from Richard zisman schools what do you say to teachers  parents who are hearg this nervous about gog back can you expla to them what these route daily screengs look like  for families that are golden sports I know can't ask about this but more specifically I'm hearg a lot from hockey players do you expect that there will be hockey games played at any pot  this year here  versed Columbia for kids or even rec league adults well hockey   other sports whether they're played  beer leagues or whether there's youth mor or hockey organizations that we're gog to be workg through that to the fall we have a season ahead  us for baseball  other summer activities we're gog to be focusg on that first  foremost I have written two head  the NHL as well as the NHL Players Association to fer British Columbia as a place to potentially restart the NHL assumg that the games will be played without without audiences but stead would be played for television unfortunately the BC Lions need to have bums  seats  I don't see that happeng but we'll be workg with the CFL as well which also creates economic activity with our community on the broader issue  gog back to school Rob Flemg has been workg with Terry moorg the head  the BC Teachers Federation with other support workers  the system with trustees with parent groups we want to make sure that we can safely get kids back to classrooms it's not just about readg writg  arithmetic I answered a question from a viewer on one  the television networks yesterday a young a young viewer who wanted to get back to school to see her friends   that is a reasonable thg for young people to do school is a place  joy for many people that may not have been for some but it is a place  joy for young people  they want to get back to it but we want to make sure that's done safely  we don't want anyone to feel that they're obliged to we've seen virtual learng takg place over the past number  weeks positive outcomes there but it's not perfect we want to make sure we can do a dry run between now  the end  June or pardon me the the begng  June's at the end  June we're not anticipatg any crease   class teachg until well after the mailg we kept mister Flemg  I will be havg more to say about that probably later next week or perhaps after the the long weekend but what I'm hearg from people is are there concerns absolutely but there's also an overwhelmg desire to get back to a place where we can have kids teractg with each other learng about not just how to read how to writes  how to count but also how to be teract with other people this brgs up the issue I raised earlier about racism  British Columbia our social teractions  our schools multicultural schools where there are people from around the world young kids you know there's a school district verter be 109 languages are spoken  one  the schools  Edmonds  Burnaby that is an outstg thg to talk about  that is the type  British Columbia that we all want to see people workg together  harmony enjoyg livg  one  the greatest places on the planet schools a vital part  that we're not gog to force anyone but we're workg with all  the various stakeholders  their numerous everyone's got a common purpose  that's to make sure that we can get kids back to classrooms  a safe manner as soon as possible but likely that we're not we're  fact I know we won't see full participation until September if at that time thanks everybody []"
72,0.0,so add Snowden a lot  people  this country are probably curious when was the last time you had substantive discussions about comg home to the United States  would this still be your preference do you still refer to it as home the United States will always be my home  I'll always be willg to come back on a sgle condition  I've been quite clear about this over the years this is that the government guarantee that I have the right  every whistleblower has the right to tell the jury why they did what they did right we can disagree about whether this was right or wrong we can disagree about whether this is good or bad we can disagree about whether this is legal early illegal that's right  proper  a democracy but we have to agree that the jury is supposed to be the proper authority to ultimately decide was this right or wrong  I hate to say it but under current laws that is explicitly forbidden under the Espionage Act which as you know it's creasgly beg used agast the sources  journalism stead  foreign spies the law makes no distction between someone who tells a secret to a journalist  someone who tells a secret to a foreign government   so yeah there have nots there has not been any movement unfortunately on that conversation sce the Obama admistration when I told that the government that all they need to do is give me the right  what we call a public terest fense this is a fair trial an open trial where the jury hears what is happeng  they decide was this justified or not  unfortunately a then Attorney General Eric Holder responded  said we can't promise that we won't promise that we will promise not to torture you unfortunately I'd say that's not quite enough somethg you've said repeatedly is that you would expect  you would accept a certa punishment for your actions what if that package  punishment  workg for the home team what if someone said help us harden our elections from attack usg your skills I would volunteer for that stantly you know they they wouldn't even have to pay me for that remember I volunteered to work for the CIA for the NSA when I came forward to reveal mass surveillance which we need to be clear the courts have found was  fact unlawful on the part  the government  one court said likely unconstitutional so I have no objection to helpg the government I came forward not to burn the NSA down I came forward to reform it to help it return to the ideals that we're all supposed to share so there will never be a question  when my government is ready when my government wants me to help I will be there how has your opion changed about mr. Put sce you've been  Russia well I don't thk it really has changed because the question might presume that I had a positive opion at some pot I thk everyone would agree probably cludg the Russian President himself that he is an authoritarian leader I thk the Russian government broadly does not have a good record on human rights  that hasn't changed how odd is it to you that while you've been there consensus here has hardened that they are the actors who terfered  our last presidential election I don't thk that's especially surprisg there was a story published   New York Times actually reportg on a study  February  2018  was also done  the Washgton  a few months prior to that about the record  electoral terference  they looked at the history  Russia  the Soviet Union  an electoral Intel terference by telligence agencies  they found I thk 36 different cases  electoral terference over roughly the past 50 years but then they also looked at the United States telligence services  found that we hit enter feared  foreign elections eightyone different times now this is not to say one is better than the other it's not about that it's about budget about capability but we do what we do see from this is that what happened  2016 actually was not unusual from the perspective  telligence agencies this is what they believe are they are hired to do what we have to do is fd out how to secure our systems agast the attacks that we know are evitable somethg you've been asked before somethg you have answered before but sce this is a fresh occasion we'll will ask it aga why not stay  this country  face the  if you believed  the strength  your conviction this is a great question Brian  I'm glad you asked it when we say face the  the question is well what song are they playg I was tentionally charged as every major whistleblower  the last decades has been with the very particular crime this is a violation  the Espionage Act  1917   this is a law that is explicitly designed to prohibit a meangful defense  court this is applied or this law is used agast people who's the only thg that they've done  this is by the government's own terms the only thg the government accuses people defendg themselves agast this charge I have done is that they have told somethg to a journalist that the government considers classified that is the whole  the crime they don't consider whether it was good or bad they don't consider whether or not it caused harm simply did you tell somethg classified to a journalist if you did the jury is not allowed to consider   fact they're explicitly forbidden from considerg why you told journalists they're explicitly forbidden from considerg did it result  a public benefit right did it further the public terest stead they simply say did you tell a journalist let the glass buy so I am NOT if I had stayed  the United States  my good friend Daniel Ellsberg by the way that has told me that I was right not to st  wait for an evitable arrest because the laws  the way they're enforced today is not the same as the 1970s when he came forward with the Pentagon Papers I would not have received a fair trial there would not have been much  a trial at all I would only have received a sentencg  the question there is what message does that send whether you like me or not I could be the best person  the world I could be the worst what message does a conviction where you spend the rest  your life  prison for tellg journalists thgs that change the laws  the United States that have resulted  the most substantive reform so telligence authorities sce the 1970s if the only result  dog that is a life sentence  prison the next person who sees somethg crimal happeng  the United States government will be discouraged from comg forward  I can't be a part  that where do your parents come down on what you did  the book we learn a lot more than we knew about them they were both we say this  quotes deep Staters we learn that they both had varyg degrees  security clearances  their lives yeah I come from a federal family my father worked for the military my mother works for the courts my whole le gog back has worked  the  the government service so I thk this was difficult for them   fact one  the thgs that I will be eternally grateful for is the fact that they still st by me today  believe that I did the right thg were they present for your weddg you've gone  gotten married  the years sce we've last spoken there hasn't been a weddg yet actually we were married but it was just a paperwork sighs  a courthouse because Ldsay  I had been livg together we had been  love with each other we had been  a relationship for more than ten years there will be a weddg someday Brian  I hope you'll be there what do you make  Donald Trump there are so many thgs that are said about the president right now  so much thkg  honestly I try not to thk about it there's so much chaos  there are so many aggressive  fensive thgs said I thk even his supporters would would grant that but I thk he's actually quite simple to underst Donald Trump strikes me like nothg so much as a man who has never really known a love that he hasn't had to pay for  so everythg that he does is formed by a kd  transactional ism I thk  what he is actually lookg for is simply for people to like him unfortunately that produces a lot  negative effects do you believe he is a threat to national security I mean this is the question  who defes national security what is national security when we used to talk about national security we thought about public safety but now national security really means the security  the system itself the stitution  government  I thk he's made it his stated goal to change the way that system works I thk we have seen tremendous harm done to civil liberties  the United States creasgly sce September 11th  I haven't seen any reduction  the rate  that we have several important jobs vacant  this country cludg director  national security national security advisor is that a threat to our security I thk it really says somethg about where we are what this pot  our history looks like when we fd that there are not enough people  the country that are willg not to serve  the White House  qualify to serve  the White House who all sides  the government feel comfortable workg with  who they can back we are  a time that is creasgly fractured  I thk that's a product  the fact that look if you look around at the world right now when you look at news when you look at news coverage when you look at every controversy that we see somethg has changed  that is that it has become creasgly popular for your feelgs to matter more than the facts  I thk that's toxic to a democracy because if there's one thg that we have to have to be able to have this discussion to be able to learn to live with people that we disagree with we can't have a conversation about what we should do we can't have a conversation about where we are gog if we can't agree on where we are if we can't agree on what is happeng facts have to matter more than the feelgs you've said your greatest fear over what you did was that thgs would not change have thgs changed would you do it aga today knowg what you know now this is a significant portion  the the fal chapter  my book thgs have changed  I would do it aga if I changed anythg I would hope that I could have come forward sooner it took me so long just to underst what was happeng  it took so long not to realize that nobody else was gog to fix this believe me when I say I did not want to light a match  burn my life to the ground no one does nobody really wants to be a whistleblower but the results  that have been staggerg I thought this was gonna be two days story I thought everybody was gonna forget about this a week after the journalist ran the first stories  2013 but here we are  2019  we're still talkg about it  fact data security surveillance the ternet manipulation  fluence that's provided or produced rather by a corporate or governmental control  this permanent record  all  our private lives that's been created every day by the devices that we have before 2013 if you said there's a system that's watchg everythg you do the government is collectg records  every phone call  the United States even for those people who are not suspected  any crime it was a conspiracy yes there were some people who believed it was happeng yes there were academics who could say this was technically possible yes there were technologists who could went this is somethg that could be done but what we didn't have it was we the world  2013 we suspected some suspected that this was happeng the world after 2013 we know that it's happeng  this is the critical importance  journalism particularly  this moment that we have today the distance between speculation  fact is everythg  a democracy because that's what what lets us as we did post 2013 change our laws now the very first program that was real to newspapers I has sce been termated Barack Obama who criticized me so strongly  June  2013 by January  201 was proposg that this program be ended eventually it was ended under the USA Freedom Act the NSA argued that mass surveillance was legal bulk collection as they they call it they said 15 different judges authorized this what they didn't tell us was that those 15 judges all belonged to the rubberstamp FISA Court that over 33 years had been asked 33 thous ne hundred times by the government to approve surveillance requests only said tow  33 years 11 times now this was a court that was never designed to terpret the Constitution right it was never designed to create novel powers for the telligence community it was just designed to stamp basic route warrants now we know what has changed the very first open court outside  these secret rubberstamp courts that got this case  front  them I was judge Leon  a federal court  then a court  appeals  said that the NSA's mass surveillance activities were violatg even the very loose stards  the Patriot Act they broke the law he further said these programs are likely unconstitutional  this would not have happened if we couldn't say this is real this is actually happeng  I just want to make clear that's not me sayg that that's not speculation that was the determation  the Supreme Court just a few months before I came forward  a famous case Amnesty versus clapper I I believe it was  February  2013 or door December  2012 all the way to the Supreme Court these surveillance authorities were beg challenged the platiff said the government has a mass surveillance program it has impacted this human rights organization they have been spied on  secret by the government the government said that may be but if it's happeng we will neither conform confirm nor deny that it's happeng it is a state secret  because you can't prove it the court should be forbidden from rulg on the constitutionality  this program  sadly the Supreme Court  the United States agreed they said this program could be unconstitutional but if you cannot prove it exists we cannot evaluate it that's what 2013 changed on the legal side we have now had the GDP or we have firt had the first European regulation that are tryg to limit the amount  data that can be collected secretly  used agast populations broadly  we have also seen the basic structure  the Internet itself change  response to this understg that the network path that all  our communications cross when you request a website when you send a text message when you read an email for so long those communications have been electronically naked or unencrypted before 2013 more than half the world's ternet communications were unencrypted now far more than half are measured by just web traffic from where the world's leadg browsers the Google Chrome browser some figures showed it more than 80 percent the entire world has changed  the last few years it hasn't gone far enough the problems still exist   some ways they've gotten worse but we have made progress that would not have been possible if we didn't know what was gog on related question what today can the government do to your phone  your laptop the phone  laptop  any American what's the extent  the government's reach if they're determed to reach to your life we could talk about this question for hours Brian but we don't have time so I'll try to summarize hackg has creasgly become what governments consider a legitimate vestigative tool they use the same methods  techniques as crimal hackers  what this means is they will try to remotely take over your device once they do this by detectg a vulnerability   the stware that your device runs such as Apple's iOS or Microst Wdows they can craft a special kd  attack code called an exploit they then launch this exploit at the vulnerability on your device which allows them to take total control  that device anythg you can do on that device the attacker  this case the government can do they can read your email they can collect every document they can look at your contact book they can turn the location services on they can see anythg that is on that phone stantly  send it back home to the mothership they can do the same with laptops the other prong that we forget so frequently is that  many cases they don't need to hack our devices they can simply ask Google for a copy  our email box because Google saves a copy  that everythg that you've ever typed to that search box Google has a copy  every private message that you've sent on Facebook every lk that you've clicked everythg that you've liked they keep a permanent record   all  these thgs available not just to these companies but to our governments as they are creasgly deputized as sort  miature arms  government what about enablg your microphone camera if you can do it they can do it it is trivial to remotely turn on your microphone or to activate your camera so long as you have systemslevel access if you had hacked someone's device remotely anythg they can do you can do they can look up your nose right they can record what's  the room the screen may be f as it's sittg on your desk but the device is talkg all  the time the question we have to ask is who is it talkg to even if your phone is not act right now you look at it it's just sittg there on the charger it is talkg tens or hundreds or thouss  times a mute to any number  different companies who have apps stalled on your phone it looks like it's f it looks like it's just sittg there but it is constantly chatterg  unfortunately like pollution we have not created the tools that are necessary for ordary people to be able to see this activity  it is the visibility  it that makes it so popular  common  attractive for these companies because if you do not realize they're collectg this data from you this very private  personal data there's no way you're gog to object to it what about its ability to track its own  talk to me specifically about the case  Jamal khashoggi so  the case  Jamal Khashoggi this is a Washgton  reporter  a primary critic  the Saudi regime he was lured to the Saudi Arabian consulate  Istanbul  Turkey  while his fiance waited outside for him to get the paperwork he needed  order to marry her he was murdered by the Saudi government allegedly on the orders  the Crown Prce now we have to ask ourselves how did the Saudi government decide that he was worth killg how did they decide when  how they would kill him how did they know this opportunity was gog to arise how do they know what his plans  tentions were that they needed to stop from their perspective we don't have evidence that his phone personally was hacked unfortunately because we do not have his phone but we do have the phones  his friends who were livg  exile  Canada  we do know thanks to the research  a group called the citizen lab affiliated with a university  Canada that their phones were hacked which means their conversations with Jamal khashoggi were tercepted  this allowed the Saudi regime to know that he was tendg to create an electronic protest movement they didn't need to know from his friend's phone or even from his phone that he was travellg to the consulate because he had to make an appotment but it did tell them his private tentions his hopes  dreams for a different government for their country  perhaps although we do not know for sure on that basis they decided to murder him once your phone is hacked what is  their hs is not simply your device it is your future it's important also to remember how did the government  Saudi Arabia manage to hack these people's phones which are modern phones well they didn't have this capability  their government they didn't have this level  telligence capability available to them directly so they purchased it from a digital arms broker a company called the NSO Group an Israeli company  this company the only thg they do is manufacture digital weapons kd  hackg tools they can be used agast the critical frastructure that all  us rely on the phones  our pockets they primarily target devices such as the Apple iPhone  they sell this capability to break to phones  people around the world for millions  millions  dollars to some  the worst governments on earth  the only meangful oversight that they have unfortunately because the export control laws for these kd  digital weapons are extremely weak  Israel is their own ternal ethics board this is oh it was fe we didn't break any rules that has to change what about the public attitude held by millions  everyday Americans all I've got on a computer is pictures  my family CCTV cameras that are prevalent  a ton  American cities  overseas capitals those cameras are your friend if you're nocent  have nothg to hide well I'd say that's very much what the average Chese citizen believed or perhaps even still to this day believes but we see how these same technologies are beg applied to create what they call the social credit system if any  these family photos if any  your activities onle if your purchases if your associations if your friends or  any way different from what the government or the powersthatbe  the moment would like them to be you're no longer able to purchase tra tickets you're no longer a to board an airplane you may not be able to get a passport you may not be eligible for a job you might not be able to work for the government all  these thgs are creasgly beg created  programmed  decided by algorithms  those algorithms are fueled by precisely the nocent data that our devices are creatg all  the time constantly visibly quietly right now our devices are castg all  these records that we do not see beg created that  aggregate seemed very nocent you were at Starbucks at this time you went to the hospital afterwards you spent a long time at the hospital after you left the hospital you made a phone call you made a phone call to your mother you talked to her until the middle  the night the hospital was an oncology clic even if you can't see the content  these communications the activity records what the government calls metadata which they argue they do not need a warrant to collect tells the whole story  these activity records are beg created  shared  collected  tercepted constantly by companies  governments  ultimately it means as they sell these as they trade these as they make their busesses on the backs  these records what they are sellg is not formation what they're sellg is us they're sellg our future they're sellg our past they are sellg our history our identity  ultimately they are stealg our power  makg our stories work for them what devices do you use  your life now  have you accepted the notion that you are watched rather constantly well probably every telligence the world is defitely targetg me  trouble anythg they can just as they did with Jamal khashoggi  regards to what are my plans  tentions I try not to make that easy for them if I get a smart phone  I need to use a phone I actually open it up before I use it I perform a kd  surgery on it to physically desolder or sort  melt the metal connections that hold the microphone on the phone  I physically take this f I remove the camera for the phone  then I close it back up I seal it up  then if I need to make a phone call I will attach an external microphone on  this is just so if the phone is sittg there  I'm not makg a call it cannot hear me now this is extreme most people do not need this but for me it's about beg able to trust our technology my phone could still be hacked my laptop could still be hacked  just as I told you before the same prciples applied to me if it is hacked they can do anythg to the device that I can do so my trust  technology is limited but just because that's how it is today doesn't mean that's how it has to be  a large majority  my work with the freedom  the press foundation where I serve as president  the board is dedicated to tryg to make technology more secure to try to create programs  protocols by which we can make the communications  sources  journalists more confidential because if we lose the confidentiality between sources  journalists we lose access to those essential facts that let us underst what's happeng  the world  unfortunately under this White House just like under the prior White House we see the sources  very important stories that have advanced the public terest facg retaliation from a very angry government I believe it's  the first half  the book  I'm paraphrasg you come out  just say the computer guy knows everythg or at least he should what part computer guy are you were you  what part traed spy well for the vast majority  my career I was what was called a systems engeer or a systems admistrator an admistrator sort  matas  exps a system that they have herited  a systems engeer sort  develops new projects new capabilities for these systems roles what this means  short was that all  the systems the NSA  the CIA that I was put  charge  I had total access to  this is just what happens with the systems admistrator when you thk about a computer system who gives someone else access well someone has to be the origal authority that has access to everythg that was me  so I would say the computer guy knows everythg that's not a boast that's simply the way these systems are designed that's the way they're structured  this is very much a vulnerability because it means that you have to trust this this admistrator will work to the good  the users but what happens when the people usg that network the people constructg that network are gog agast the benefit  the broader society  this put me  a very terestg kd  conflicted position I could do what the NSA wanted me to do or I could do what the Constitution  the United States the the public  the United States needed me to do which was report that my agency had broken the law do you regard yourself as a journalist these days I'm not I'm not I have tremendous respect for journalists but I try to keep a distance particularly  this moment where so much  journalism is comg under attack because the government has a tremendous centive to discredit me to make people distrust me  so if I hold myself out if I start reportg stories if I start talkg to sources if I try to start advancg what the public knows on a personal level my reputation could could sort  poison stead I keep a distction what I do is I try to aid the work  journalism but I am NOT myself a journalist your book is highly personal tell us about the price your then girlfriend now wife paid for your actions  how you feel she was miss portrayed  the eyes  the world when we got that first kd  thumbnail sketch  who she was so  the wake  the revelations  mass surveillance  2013 this was suddenly the world's biggest story  every country they were talkg about the same thg  unfortunately that meant that everyone who was connected to me  some way they were also talkg about because they were tryg to say who I was where I came from  this unfortunately meant that Ldsey my lifelong partner was tensely vestigated both by the FBI  the United States she didn't know what I was dog I could not tell her what I was dog because if I had they would have said she was an accessory to the crime they would have said she was part  a crimal conspiracy so long as she didn't immediately pick up the phone  say help help someone's talkg to a journalist  so this meant that I couldn't tell her she learned about what was gog to happen the same way everybody else did about what is happeng the same way everybody else did she saw me on TV which probably makes me the worst boyfriend  the history  the United States but she stuck by me  we are reunited  together today  I will never be able to repay her for the faith that she's shown me but the media had a tremendous amount  salacious reportg when they realized that she taught toll pole fitness classes which are quite popular for him  these days they called her a stripper even though she's never been one even though she's a poet even though she's a photographer they sexualized her they focused on her body they focus on her image because that's what got attention she's a much more complex  deep figure than the media ever gave her credit for she is more brave then anyone can possibly underst  she's more political  telligent than any  these reporters at the time could appreciate her politics  fact fluenced me  I'd like to thk I learned as much from her or perhaps even more than she ever learned from me you pat a portrait  what some  us knew  that was that you were a thoroughly American kid  your upbrgg you wake up every day  Russia you go to sleep every night  Russia are you actively seekg to get out are you as has been reported lookg for asylum elsewhere well this is not an actively seekg this is not a new thg  this is important history especially for those people who don't like me for those people who doubt me who have heard terrible thgs about me it was never my tention to end up  Russia I was gog to Lat America  my fal destation was hopefully gog to be Ecuador when the United States government heard that I had left Hong Kong where I met the journalists they canceled my passport they gave press conferences about it which meant I wasn't allowed to board my ongog flight which was gog to take me that's a Lat America rather than applyg for Russian asylum rather than sayg I'll play ball with any Russian telligence service just please protect me I said no I will not cooperate with the Russian government or any government stead what I did as I was trapped for 0 days  an airport I don't know a year longest layover is but 0 days was was a tough stt I applied for asylum  27 different countries around the world traditional US allies places like France  Germany places like Norway that I felt the US government  the American public could be comfortable that was fe for whistleblower beg  yet every time one  these governments got close to openg their doors the phone would rg  they're  their Foreign Mistries  on the other end  the le would be a very senior American ficial it was one  two people then Secretary  State John Kerry or then Vice President Joe Biden  they would say look we don't care what the law is we don't care if you can do this or not we underst the protectg whistleblowers  grantg asylum as a matter  Human Rights  you could do this if you want to but if you protect this man if you let this guy out  Russia there will be consequences we're not gonna say what they're what they're gonna be but there will be a response I contue to this day to say look if the United States government if these countries are willg to open the door that is not a hostile act that is the act  the front  a friend if anythg if the United States government is so concerned about Russia right shouldn't they be happy for me to leave  yet we see they're tryg so hard to prevent me from leavg I would ask you why is that I'm guessg Joe Biden is not your cidate for 2020 actually I don't take a position on the 2020 race look it's a difficult position beg  the executive branch it's a difficult position beg  power  you have to make unpopular decisions I would like to thk havg seen now  2019 that all  the allegations agast me did not come true national security was not harmed as a result  these disclosures but they did w the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism the laws were changed as a result the courts said these programs were unconstitutional we live  a safer  more secure world because the Internet is safer  more secure as a result  understg these common vulnerabilities which not just US telligence agencies we're exploitg but our adversaries were exploitg one close these holes we do not become more vulnerable we become more secure  2013 it's fair to say some  these ficials some  these cidates grow well the telligence services are sayg this guy's dangerous they're sayg this is a risk they're sayg this shouldn't have happened  2019 we can see that no evidence has ever been presented that the public understg mass surveillance is real has caused any kd  harm whatsoever no one has died no terrorist attacks have succeeded because we knew about this stuff these programs work regardless  whether or not you know about them but we have seen the public benefits substantiated year after year after year  so I'd like to thk these people would reevaluate their position you know there are government ficials who would push back very strong on your assertion that national security was not harmed you do you chose not to stop with your revelations at what was beg done to Americans  you got to America  its allies  perceived enemies when we're lookg at the reports that were published  2013 it's important to underst I never published a sgle story the number  documents that I revealed is zero what I did was I collected an archive  material showg crimality or unethical or unconstitutional behavior on the part  the United States government I provided this archive to journalists who were required as a condition  access to this material not to publish any story because it's terestg they could publish no story simply because it's newsworthy they were only allowed as so far as the agreement went to publish stories that they were willg to st up  say we're  the public terest to know  this is not some crazy flybynight organization these are newspapers like the Washgton  like the New York Times like the Guardian   every case this process was followed now as an extraordary check on top  this  case I went too far  case I collected a document that was too hot or I misunderstood thgs or the jernt the journalists misunderstood thgs the journalists were further required to go to the government  advance  publication  they were required to do this at my request  warned the government this is the story that we're gonna run this is what it's about this is what we're gonna say so the government could argue agast it to create an adversarial check on what the journalists  I were tryg to do to reconstruct the system  checks  balances  the United States that hid itself failed  the government you know because that process was followed so scrupulously that's why I am so confident that no harm happened no harm occurred now if there are those  the government that say harm took place if there are those  the government who say people have died I ask you this why haven't they proved it you know better than anyone Brian that these government ficials are more than happy to pick up a phone  make a leak to the New York Times every day  the week I if they had some evidence that somebody was hurt if they had evidence that a terrorist attack got through because  this journalism it would be  the front page  every newspaper  the world  despite six years  history that's never happened describe your life today what is every day like how are you supportg yourself   as a simple equation if the Russians have reached so effectively to our lives  our electoral systems they must be all over your life so that was several different questions but yeah I'm sure the Russian government is tryg to spy on me I'm sure the United States government is tryg to spy on me everyone's tryg to spy on me the thg is I don't cooperate with them my allegiance is to my country my allegiance is to my Constitution now  my terms  my daily life it's actually pretty ordary Oh which is to say it's not so terestg I've always been somethg  an door cat right among nightclubs  partyg my life sce I was a child has always been mediated by a screen that's my choice so not much actually changes  my daytoday whether I'm livg  New York or Berl or Moscow  terms  my work which a lot  people are curious about this I thk is a polite way  people askg do you work for the Russian government do you accept money from the Russian government you know are you livg  Russian government housg are you  a bunker are there guards   course the answer to all  these is no no I'm not what I do for a livg is speak pressionally  now I'm actually an author I have a speaker's bureau it's called the American program Bureau  you can call them  you can book a public event I speak at universities I speak at corporate events I speak at cybersecurity conferences to talk to people about what is happeng on the ternet what is the future  surveillance  how can we protect ourselves I'm very fortunate to have had that opportunity  it's meant that I've had a quite comfortable life   quite a difficult position the former White House aide HR Haldeman left us with an expression for the ages  when he said you can't put the toothpaste back  the tube for Americans who feel that that this is just a behemoth that they could there's no way they could have any control over it for Americans who long ago decided we're just gog to have to live with this surveillance how could it possibly be receded or rescded or stopped we can stop a program we can thwart an attack we can make a device more secure but as you imply the system is still better the stitutions  agencies  companies that produced these attacks that are creatg new methods  spyg every day will still be there the fundamental change not just  the United States but around the world that has to happen is we have to stop thkg about the limitations on how data is used as data protection regulations right now when we talk about what Google  Facebook are dog right now when we talk about what the NSA is dog right now when we talk about what rival governments are dog what the Russians are dog what the Chese are dog what the North Koreans  the Iranians are dog we're constantly thkg about all right this data has been collected  these companies have it how do we regulate their use regulatg the use is a mistake we should do that but that's the wrong focus it is the collection  data that is a problem when you start tryg to regulate use you're gog to the collection has already happened the collection was already legal one  the fundamental flaws  u.s. privacy legislation is the fact that we are one  the only advanced democracies  the world that does not have any basic privacy law whatsoever we have the Fourth Amendment  the Constitution which is the reason that I came forward but that restricts what the federal government can do that restricts what the state governments can do it doesn't restrict what companies can do  as you know as everybody knows these companies are playg a bigger  bigger part  the world today we have to say all  these records that they're creatg about all  us all this control that they're developg from these surveillance programs whether they're sayg they're dog it for targetg advertisements or whether they're dog it for targetg killgs these records belong to the people that they are about not to the companies  this is a fundamental change that we have never discussed  a meangful way broadly  publicly but we have to because all  these governments have said you know the the mass surveillance system why do we have it why is it useful they say because  terrorism they say it's savg lives they save its oppressive antg attacks but no less than Barack Obama  the response to the 2013 revelations created two dependent Commission's to vestigate exactly the answer to that question were these programs effective  stoppg terrorist attacks did these revelations cause harm to national security it was called the privacy  civil liberties oversight board  the president's review group on telligence  communications technologies  despite havg an enormous budget despite havg complete access to classified formation despite the fact that they terviewed the heads  the FBI the NSA the CIA you know the full alphabet soup they found  the government's own words the kd  mass surveillance that's represented by this bulk collection program where the NSA was secretly collectg the phone records  every American  everybody else around the world every day under an authority provided by a secret court order that nobody even knew existed that program had never made their own words a concrete difference  a sgle counterterrorism vestigation thk about that more than 10 years  operation  secret never made a sgle concrete difference these programs mass surveillance is not about public safety it is not about terrorism it is about power it is about economic espionage it is about diplomatic manipulation  it is about social fluence it is about understg the actions  everyone  the world as carefully as they can no matter who they are no matter how nocent their life fal question has to do with the Fourth Amendment we have it today because mr. Adams  others wanted to keep the British out  their homes  their horse carriages what would mr. Adams  the founders make  the reach  the government  your view to our lives given its humble begngs I thk if any  the founders  this country looked around today they would be shocked by the kd  rhetoric they hear  they would be shocked by the kd  activities  government they see if you read the Bill  Rights somethg that struck me when I was writg about it   this book was that fully half  the first ten amendments are explicitly makg the work  government harder they're makg life for law enforcement ficials harder  all  the foundg fathers thought that was a good idea because they recognized the more efficient a government is the more dangerous it is we want a government always that is not too efficient we want a government always that is just efficient enough because government holds extraordary power  our lives we want government always to be usg their powers  a way that is only necessary  proportionate to the threat presented by whoever it is that they're vestigatg when the government is gettg by by the sk  their teeth the people are free right the government should be afraid  the people people shouldn't be afraid  the government one  the ironies about the foundg fathers for those who are skeptical  me which is fair aga I don't want you to trust me  I want you to doubt me I want you to question me but I want you to look at the facts I want you to look beyond how you feel  the moment how we all feel  the moment  see what these stories said  2013 see that the courts  the United States where I'm beg charged as a crimal said that the government itself was engaged  crimal activity look at these thgs  then remember the people who founded this country were called traitors the signg the writg  the Declaration  Independence was an outrageous act  treason it was crimal but it was also right the question whether or not I broke the law is less difficult  less terestg than whether you thk what I did was right or wrong what is legal is not always the same as what is more fal prediction then we'll let you go nightclubbg  that is do you predict do you predict you will at some pot live out your life  die  the United States I thk I will return when we look at the kd  thgs that we're beg said about me  2013 the kd  hostility I face the kd  accusations I faced from the most senior ficials  government  we look at the world today yes there are many still who don't like me but far far fewer because we have seen that all the harms that they alleged over the course  these years never came to pass they were never substantiated because they don't exist but the benefits are becomg more clear with each passg year the question that I thk people have to answer whether you like me as person or not right whether you agree with how I did what I did whether you agree with the work  the journalists who decided what the public should know  order to cast their votes today you know the government broke the law today you know the United States government had broken that violated the Constitution  the rights  people  this country  around the world would you rather not know thank you  Snowden thank you very much good luck with the book that's my pleasure Brian thank you for havg me hey there I'm Chris Hayes from  thanks for watchg  on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're puttg out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots  other great videos
73,0.0,the average American makes more than a ton  trash every year most  us seem to like this toss  go lifestyle but Lauren sger is not most  us this consumerist trash lifestyle is is very new  very modern  I thk it's really a possibility to essentially revert back to lifestyle habits that existed before this disposable society became really prevalent  the last two years the 23year old New Yorker has produced so little trash that it fits side a 16 ounce mason jar I see the jar over there you might need to go to the second jar soon no no there's that's air there's defitely room  there Lauren is at the forefront  a small but growg movement  people who strive to live with zero waste to fd out how they do it I recently met Lauren at her Brooklyn apartment my way here I was like I was like this better be legit I was like I'm gonna be sniffg at if it's not but now I'm totally convced like there's new trash can to the matter ya know that is like my exboyfriends biggest thg he's like Lauren you have to have a trash can  the bathroom I was like no how do you defe trash for me trash is anythg that ends up  a lfill or is discarded with no tention  beg reused or recycled everythg from gum to puttg a mattress on the side  the street what are people most curious about I thk people are really curious about like the more timate thgs like condoms  periods  toilet paper I mean those are the questions I get the most so let's quickly break down the lifestyle a little bit straw us I use staless steel straws cups I'll brg a mason jar paper towels paper products I used cotton napks to clean my home I still use toilet paper contrary to popular belief but I use recycled toilet paper  just recycle the little tube you make your own deodorant mmhmm cleang products cleang products I make all my own cleang products condoms  feme hygiene condoms are actually one form  trash that I do produce  the as far as feme care I use somethg called a menstrual cup which is essentially a silicone cup  you just basically wash it out to show f some  her tricks for zerowaste livg Lauren took me shoppg the Lauren where are we right now we're at tegral yoga natural foods which is where I buy a lot  my bulk products  you buy a lot  products here but when I look around I see a lot  thgs you can't buy like thgs I love like these cookies there are also so many thgs that I can buy let's take a look around so this is my ma aisle right here so they have everythg you have cfee beans  tons  different types  pasta Wow  then we can do some vegetables or even some spices I like to use this  pasta so I take from the plastic jar  I put it  the glass one as well it smells really good what's amazg yeah I love it so the reason I prefer shoppg at the farmers market aga is because  like bold produce stickers on every can we just have a moment for the stickers who puts these stickers on so this drives me nuts  this has to go to my trash jar which is really frustratg feels like I'm runng away from home or somethg we can get juice too or smoothie a few ones yeah can I do the morng sunshe smoothie with a base  apple but can you do it  this  then the same with caves whatever he wants also  the mason jar yeah I guess I'll have the same thg thank you yeah are you sure do you know what's  it No oh how can you not use these yeah thanks maybe you can you can you reuse that one there cool perfect see but you have to be on it you got to be sharp oh very good yeah okay so now I fished me because it was credibly good  I have an overwhelmg urge to toss it I'll grab this done no leakage  we can shave one  these guys all right thank you I feel bad this may unit carryg around my straw we headed back to her place to try the results  our shoppg trip mushrooms yeah somethg exploded this fool so even here like you can see as we start cuttg thgs that like all  this would have been garbage we weren't compostg it  compostg is just a nice word for lettg it rot somewhere right exactly yeah  turng back to soil when I transitioned to this lifestyle I found that I was eatg so much better  I was feelg better  I felt better when I woke up sure this sound isn't the most appetizg very like Dane Cook macaroni  cheese if you've ever seen that but there was still a lot I didn't underst when did you become somebody who was even conscious  the environment I've always loved nature I've always gotten you know really excited about beg outside  seeg pretty sunsets you know the whole field help us underst how you go from oh that's a pretty sunset to I'm no longer under producg any crash  my adult life there was a girl  one  my classes that would brg this plastic bag with a plastic clamshell full  food  a plastic drk bottle  a plastic fork  knife  I would watch her throw it  the garbage class after class  I would get totally frustrated  then one day after class when I was feelg kd  upset I went home to make dner  I opened my fridge  I saw that everythg that I had was packaged  plastic I was gettg so mad at this girl  I'm that girl  I was producg so much trash I kd  made a decision there to just go for it zero waste life recently Lauren turned her garbage free lifestyle to a busess she launched the simply to make products for sustaable livg but there are some bits  garbage even Lauren can't avoid every company has an orig story  as you say yours is bound up with the lifestyle that you started  a lot  that lifestyle is represented  that little glass contaer yes what are we lookg at here yeah this is my this is my jar  trash from the past two years two years  trash two years  trash do you want to take a look yeah let's dump it out so as a rule  thumb if it rots you can compost it yeah it's not the most catchy phrase but yeah I mean we can even separate it out this is today's contribution I'm sorry about that Lauren I really am so there really isn't anythg here that's not plastic based this is for the side  vitams just to keep them fresh my dreaded bar straws baids plastic gift wrap this one guy was super adamant about me havg a wristb the little plastic thgies that connect pricetags to a piece  clothg there's so many  these thgs that are not recyclable  so where do they end up like the ocean fally it was tastg time do you want to serve it up oh okay this is like one  my favorites Lauren this is great thank you very much for troducg us trash free lifestyle thanks for beg good sucia it seems very doable yeah I'm sad totally do not I'm home you did it  you were not you're not the radical I made you out to be

91,0.0,"IN A WAY THAT\'S  ACTUALLY KIND OF  POSITIVE. WE AS NEW  YORKERS, WE TEND  TO THINK ABOUT  BIG DREAMS, HAVE  BIG PLANS AND DO  THINGS WITH A LOT OF ENERGY. AS NEW YORKERS,  WE PUT OUR ALL  INTO EVERYTHING. YOU CERTAINLY  HAVE SEEN THAT IN THE WAY THAT ALL  OF YOU HAVE  FOUGHT BACK THIS  VIRUS. IT\'S BEEN  OUTSTANDING AND  I\'M VERY, VERY  PROUD OF THE  PEOPLE IN THIS  CITY. JUST LIKE WE DO  EVERYTHING IN A  BIG, BOLD WAY IN  NORMAL TIMES,  PEOPLE HAVE  FOUGHT BACK WITH  ALL THEY\'VE GOT  IN THIS TIME, AND THAT\'S WHY WE\'RE  PUSHING BACK THIS DISEASE MORE  EVERY DAY. NOW, IT WOULD BE  NATURAL FOR NEW  YORKERS TO WANT A BIG, FAST, BOLD  RESTART. IT\'S NATURAL FOR  US TO WANT TO GET BACK ON OUR FEET  AS QUICKLY AS  POSSIBLE. WE ARE NOT A  PATIENT PEOPLE,  AND THAT IS IN  MANY WAYS PART OF WHAT MAKES US  GREAT. BUT THIS IS A  TIME WHERE WE  NEED TO START  APPRECIATING  WHAT\'S GOOD ABOUT THE WORD  MODERATION,  BECAUSE FOR US TO GET TO WHERE WE  NEED TO GO, FOR  US TO GET TO THAT BIG, STRONG  RESTART, AND TO  GET TO RECOVERY,  WHICH I KNOW WE  CAN ACHIEVE, WE  HAVE TO DO THIS  THE SMART WAY. THIS IS A CASE  WHERE A LITTLE  MODERATION I  THINK WOULD BE  GOOD FOR ALL OF  US. ONE STEP AT A  TIME AND LET\'S  GET IT RIGHT. SO THERE\'S NO  ONOFF SWITCH  HERE. THIS HAS TO BE  DONE IN STAGES. IT HAS TO BE DONE GRADUALLY. THAT DOESN\'T MEAN DOING IT ANY  SLOWER THAN IT  NEEDS TO BE DONE. IT MEANS DOING IT WHEN IT\'S THE  RIGHT TIME TO  OPEN UP, WE DO  IT. WHEN WE PROVE  IT\'S WORKING, WE  TAKE THE NEXT  STEP, THE NEXT  STEP. AND THERE\'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE  WILL ANSWER AS  PART OF THIS  PROCESS, AND  WE\'RE GOING TO  COME TO  DECISIONS, SHARE  THEM WITH ALL OF  YOU AND TOGETHER  WE\'RE GOING TO  MAKE THEM WORK. SO FOR EXAMPLE,  WHAT KIND OF  PERSONAL  PROTECTIVE  EQUIPMENT WILL  PEOPLE NEED IN  EACH INDUSTRY, IN EACH PART OF OUR  ECONOMY, AS THEY  OPEN UP. THEY WANT TO BE  VERY SPECIFIC  ABOUT WHAT WILL  PROTECT BOTH THE  FOLKS WHO WORK IN EACH INDUSTRY AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE TO BE  VERY CLEAR ABOUT  HOW WE\'RE GOING  TO USE  TEMPERATURE  CHECKS, BECAUSE  THIS WILL BE AN  IMPORTANT PART OF THE EQUATION. BUT HOW WE\'RE  GOING TO USE  THEM, WHERE WE\'RE GOING TO USE  THEM, MAKING SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH  THERMOMETERS,  WE\'RE PLANNING  RIGHT NOW AND THE DETAILS WE\'LL BE  ANNOUNCING. HOW DO WE MAKE  SURE CLEANING IS  HANDLED THE RIGHT WAY? IT WILL BE  DIFFERENT  DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF WORK  WE\'RE TALKING  ABOUT, BUT WE  WANT TO BE CLEAR  AND TRANSPARENT  WHAT KIND OF  CLEANING WILL BE  NECESSARY TO  SUSTAIN THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT GOING FORWARD AND KEEP  EVERYONE SAFE. AND WHEN SOMEONE  TESTS POSITIVE,  WHAT HAPPENS  NEXT? WELL, WE ALL KNOW AND WE\'VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT IT  FOR WEEKS NOW,  AND YOU\'RE ABOUT  TO SEE IT COME  ALIVE, THE TEST  AND TRACE  INITIATIVE IS ALL ABOUT IDENTIFYING PEOPLE, TRACING  CONTACTS AND  MAKING SURE  EVERYONE WHO  NEEDS TO BE  ISOLA IS  ISOLA,  EVERYONE WHO  NEEDS TO BE  QUARANTINED THE  QUARANTINED. WE WANT TO BE  CLEAR HOW THAT  WORKS RIGHT DOWN  TO THE POINT  WHERE SOMEONE  SHOWS UP AT WORK  AND AT THAT  MOMENT FINDS OUT  THEY\'VE GOT A  POSITIVE TEST,  WHAT DO THEY DO  THEN? IF THEY FIND OUT  THE NIGHT BEFORE, WHAT DO THEY DO? WE\'RE GOING TO  LAY IT OUT SO  PEOPLE KNOW  EXACTLY HOW TO  HANDLE EACH  SCENARIO. NOW, WE ALREADY  KNOW A LOT FROM  THE SCIENCE, EVEN THOUGH NO ONE  KNOWS EVERYTHING  ABOUT THIS  DISEASE. WE KNOW A LOT  FROM THE MEDICAL  COMMUNITY. WE KNOW A LOT  ABOUT WHAT HAS  BEEN WORKING AND  NOT WORKING IN  OTHER PLACES OF  THE WORLD. WE\'RE GOING TO  TAKE THE GOOD  MODELS AND ADAPT  THEM TO WHAT WE  DO HERE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW  THERE\'S NO PLACE  LIKE NEW YORK  CITY, AND WE KNOW THAT WE AS A CITY GOVERNMENT, WE  CAN TAKE ALL THE  BEST INFORMATION  AND COME UP WITH  THE RIGHT GAME  PLAN, BUT WE NEED TO ALWAYS RUN IT  BY THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO THE  WORK, THE PEOPLE  IN EACH BUSINESS, THE PEOPLE IN  EACH SECTOR OF  OUR LIFE IN THIS  CITY AND OUR  ECONOMY WHO  UNDERSTAND THE  DAYTODAY LIFE  OF THEIR  WORKPLACES BEST  AND CAN GIVE US  REAL WORLD AD ABOUT WHAT\'S  GOING TO WORK,  WHAT\'S NOT GOING  TO WORK, WHAT  QUESTIONS THEY  NEED ANSWERED. WE WANT TO HELP  EACH BUSINESS  BACK ON THEIR  FEET AS QUICKLY  AS POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT, WE  HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ANSWER  THEIR QUESTIONS  AND HEAR THEIR  VIEW OF WHAT THEY NEED. SO WE ARE  BRINGING TOGETHER WHAT WE CALL  SECTOR ADVISORY  COUNCILS FROM  DIFFERENT PARTS  OF THIS CITY,  BOTH IN TERMS OF  DIFFERENT PAR  OF O ECONOMY,  BUT ALSO PEOPLE  THAT REPRESENT  ALL OF US, ALL  THE DIFFERENT  NEIGHBORHOODS,  PEOPLE OF ALL  BACKGROUNDS,  PEOPLE WITH  DIFFERENT  PERSPECTIVES, TO  HELP US  UNDERSTAND WHAT  IS NEEDED TO GET  THIS RESTART  RIGHT. AND IT\'S VERY,  VERY IMPORTANT  THAT WE THINK  ABOUT EVERYTHING  THAT MAKES UP  LIFE IN THIS  CITY. SO WE\'RE NAMING A GROUP OF  DIFFERENT  COUNCILS. WE\'RE GOING TO  START WITH A  GROUP OF PEOPLE  THAT I AM  APPOINTING TO  EACH. WE THINK OTHERS  NEED TO BE NAMED, WE WILL. AND IF WE THINK  ANY OTHER GROUP  HAS TO BE FORMED, WE CAN DO THAT  OBVIOUSLY AT ANY  POINT. BUT I THINK THIS  INITIAL GROUP  GIVES US A GOOD  START ON THE  THINGS WE HAVE TO WORK ON RIGHT  AWAY. SO TODAY WE ARE  GOING TO ROLL OUT SIX COUNCILS, AND THEN THERE WILL  BE FOUR MORE ON  THE WAY AFTER  THAT. THE FIRST OF  THESE WILL MEET  TOMORROW. ALL THE OTHERS  WILL BE MEETING  IN THE NEXT FEW  DAYS. BY NEXT WEEK,  EVERYONE WILL  HAVE HAD THEIR  INITIAL MEETING  AND WE\'LL BE UP  AND RUNNING. AND THEIR  QUESTIONS, THEIR  INPUT, ARE GOING  TO BE USED  IMMEDIATELY IN  OUR RESTART  PLANNING AND THEN CONTINUE ON AS WE MOVE AHEAD  TOWARDS RECOVERY. EACH GROUP WILL  HAVE BETWEEN 20  AND 0 MEMBERS. EACH GROUP WILL  BE LED BY ONE OR  TWO DEPUTY MAYORS AND HEADS OF  DIFFERENT CITY  AGENCIES GIVING  THEIR INPUT. WE\'LL ROLL OUT  TODAY THE NAMES  OF THE FIRST SIX  COUNCILS AND THEN THE ADDITIONAL  FOUR AS QUICKLY  AS POSSIBLE. AND I\'M GOING TO  GIVE YOU SOME  EXAMPLES OF  COUNCILS WE\'RE  BRINGING TOGETHER THAT ARE  PARTICULARLY  CRUCIAL FOR THE  RESTART. SO SMALL  BUSINESS. THIS ADVISORY  COUNCIL WILL BE  LED BY OUR DEPUTY MAYORS VICKY BEAM AND PHIL  THOMPSON. SMALL BUSINESS IS REALLY TAKING ON  THE CHANGE AND  I\'M GLAD THERE\'S  BEEN A ROBUST  FEDERAL AID  PROGRAM, WE NEED  TO MAKE THE  PROGRAM WORK A  LOT BETTER. WE\'RE PUSHING  HARD. WE NEED TO MAKE  SURE EVERY SINGLE SMALL BUSINESS  CAN TAKE  ADVANTAGE OF IT  DOES. WE ALSO HAVE TO  THINK ABOUT THE  SHEER MECHANICS  OF HOW THIS  RESTART CAN WORK  BEST FOR SMALL  BUSINESS. A LOT OF SMALL  BUSINESSES ARE  VERY WORRIED  ABOUT THEIR  COMEBACK. A LOT OBVIOUSLY  HAVE MUCH LESS IN THE WAY OF  RESOURCES. SMALL BUSINESS  OWNERS POUR THEIR HEART AND SOUL  INTO THEIR SMALL  BUSINESS. THERE\'S NOTHING  MORE PERSONAL  THAN CREATING A  SMALL BUSINESS,  MAKING IT WORK,  MAKING IT AN  ASSET TO YOUR  COMMUNITY AND  NEIGHBORHOOD TO  THIS WHOLE CITY. IT\'S NEVER EASY  AND, ON TOP OF  THAT, WITH ALL  THE STRUGGLES ANY SMALL BUSINESS  GOES THROUGH, AND THEY\'RE GOING  THROUGH A LOT OF  STRUGGLES BEFORE  THIS CRISIS HITS. WE TALKED ABOUT  IT A LOT IN MY  STATE OF THE CITY ADDRESS. NOW ON TOP OF  THIS PANDEMIC,  WHICH IS CREATING MORE UNCERTAINTY. SO WE ARE GOING  TO LISTEN, WE\'RE  GOING TO COME UP  WITH PLANS THAT  WILL HELP SMALL  BUSINESSES BACK  ON THEIR FEET. WE NEED THEM. WE NEED THEM  BECAUSE OF THE  HEART AND SOUL OF OUR CITY. WE NEED THEM  BECAUSE THEY\'RE  WHAT MAKE NEW  YORK CITY GREAT. WE NEED THEM  BECAUSE THAT\'S  WHERE A HUGE  PERCENTAGE OF  EMPLOYMENT IS IN  THIS CITY. WE NEED  EVERYTHING. WE NEED OUR  BODEGAS AND  CORNER STORES,  OUR BARS AND  RESTAURANTS, OUR  STARTUPS THAT ARE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR  ECONOMY. YOU NAME IT, WE  NEED THEM ALL. SO THIS GROUP  WILL BE IDEA  GENERATORS,  INNOVATORS TO  HELP US FIGURE  OUT THE NEXT  STEPS. OBVIOUSLY THIS  CITY HAS A HUGE  NUMBER OF LARGER  BUSINESSES AS  WELL AND WE  DEPEND ON THEM  DEEPLY. THE LARGER  BUSINESSES WILL  BE CRUCIAL TO  JUMP STARTING OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND WE\'RE GOING  TO BE LISTENING  FOR HOW WE CAN  HELP THEM GET UP  AND RUNNING AS  QUICKLY AS  POSSIBLE. FROM THE  EMPLOYERS I\'M  HEARING FROM,  THAT\'S THEIR  DESIRE, TO HIT  THE GROUND  RUNNING: BUT  THERE\'S A  TREMENDOUS  UNDERSTANDING WE AT IT  RIGHT AND SAFE,  AND WE CANNOT  ALLOW THE  BOOMERANG TO  HAPPEN. HUGE LOGISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS. MANY HAVE BIG  WORKPLACES THAT  HAVE TO BE  THOUGHT OF VERY  SMARTLY IN TERMS  OF KEEPING  EVERYONE SAFE. THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY OUR  DEPUTY MAYOR AND  WE\'LL BRING  TOGETHER BUSINESS OWNERS FROM  AROUND THE CITY. THE NEXT GROUP  FOCUSES ON LABOR  AND WORKFORCE  DEVELOPMENT. LET\'S TAKE WHO IS HURTING MOST IN  THIS CRISIS,  WORKING PEOPLE,  WHO IS THIS  CITY  WHY IS  THIS CITY GREAT? BECAUSE OF  WORKING PEOPLE. WHO MAKES THIS  CITY GREAT? WORKING PEOPLE. SO MANY PEOPLE  HAVE BEEN HEROS  DURING THIS  CRISIS KEEPING  THE CITY GOING  AND THEY WILL BE  THE HEROS IN THE  RESTART AND  RECOVERY AS WELL. THEY NEED TO BE  HEARD AND THEIR  RIGHT NEED TO BE  PROTEC AND  THEIR NEEDS NEED  TO BE RECOGNIZED  AND THEIR VOICES  OFTEN LEFT OUT  WHEN GOVERNMENTS  MAKE THEIR  DECISIONS. THIS TIME WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT  AND HAVE WORKING  PEOPLE AND THOSE  WHO REPRESENT  WORKING PEOPLE AT THE TABLE FROM  THE BEGINNING. I AM A BIG  BELIEVER IN THE  POWER OF OUR  LABOR MOVEMENT. THEY WILL BE  FRONT AND CENTER. THEIR VOICES WILL BE HEARD AS WE  BUILD THIS  RESTART AND  RECOVERY. THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY FIRST  DEPUTY MAYER. NOW, SOMETHING  THAT NEW YORK  CITY  UNQUESTIONABLY,  ALL OF THOSE  AMAZING  ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS, ALL OF THE INCREDIBLY TALEN PEOPLE  IN OUR ARTS  COMMUNITY AND  CULTURAL  COMMUNITY AND  TOURISM SECTOR. WE\'RE BRINGING  TOGETHER A GROUP  FOCUSED ON THOSE  AREAS, BECAUSE IT IS THE ESSENCE OF SO MUCH THAT  MAKES NEW YORK  CITY GREAT. IN OUR HEARTS AND SOULS, WHAT WE  ARE PROUD OF,  OBVIOUSLY ALSO  ONE OF THE  UNDERPINNINGS OF  OUR ECONOMY. AND ONE OF THE  PIECES THAT WE\'VE BEEN MISSING  DEEPLY HAS TO  COME BACK STRONG, HAS TO COME BACK  SMART. BUT THIS IS ALSO  A SECTOR WHERE  SOME OF THE  BIGGEST  CHALLENGES ARE,  BECAUSE  SYNONYMOUS WITH  GATHERING A LOT  OF PEOPLE  TOGETHER IN ONE  PLACE, SOME OF  OUR ARTS AND  CULTURAL VENUES  GATHER THOUSANDS  AND THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE IN CLOSE  QUARTERS. HOW ARE WE GOING  TO GO ABOUT THAT  IN THE FUTURE? WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO WHAT? THAT\'S WHAT WE\'RE GOING TO WORK  THROUGH WITH THIS GROUP, STRIKE  THAT BALANCE. SAFETY FIRST,  HEALTH OF PEOPLE  FIRST, THAT\'S JOB ONE. BUT WE WANT TO  BRING THIS SECTOR BACK STRONG. WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT  STAGES TO DO  THAT. THE DEPUTY MAYOR  WILL BE LEADING  THIS GROUP  WORKING WITH  LEADERS FROM  THESE FIELDS. THE FAITHBASED  COMMUNITY. I THINK IT IS A  CLEAR FACT WE  NEED FAITH MORE  THAN EVER IN  EVERY SENSE IN  THIS CITY AND OUR FAITHBASED  COMMUNITIES ARE  PART OF WHAT  HOLDS NEW YORK  CITY TOGETHER,  WHAT GIVES PEOPLE THE STRENGTH. THE PERSEVERANCE  WE ALL NEED. AND IN THIS CITY, IT\'S A BEAUTIFUL  THING. I SEE IT WITH MY  OWN EYES. OUR FAITH LEADERS WORTT  NEK THE TIME. SO THIS COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE  CRUCIAL TO OUR  COMEBACK  SPIRITUALLY, AS  WELL AS IN TERMS  OF ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO BRING THIS  CITY BACK  MATERIALLY. NOW, OUR FAITH  LEADERS DESERVE  TREMENDOUS CREDIT BECAUSE CLEARLY  THIS IS AS CLOSE  TO UNANIMITY AS  IT GETS, WE HAVE  SEEN FAITH  LEADERS IN EVERY  BACKGROUND SAY  SAFETY FIRST. THEY\'V N TI DOWN  WORSHIP SERS  AND MAKING SURE  IT WAS ABOUT  PEOPLE\'S SAFETY. I COMMEND THEM  AND THANK THEM  FOR THAT. THE VALUE HAS  BEEN ON HUMAN  BNGS HUMAN  LIFE AND THAT\'S  BE POWERFUL AND COMMENDABLE. NOW, THE  PRACTICAL  QUESTIONS THAT  COMES INTO PLAY,  HOW ARE WE GOING  TO RESTART  WORSHIP SERS  AND WHAT\'S THE  RIGHT WAY TO DO  IT, WHEN AND WH CONDITIONS. IS IT SOMETHING  THAT LIKE THE  OTHER LARGER  GATHERINGS HAS TO BE APPROACHED  SMARTLY. WE\'RE GOING TO BE LISTENING   VOICES OF OUR  LEADERS AS WE  DEVELOP THOSE  PLANS AND  EVERYTNG IS  GOING TO START TO MOVE IN THE  COMING DAYS AND  WEEKS AS WE PUT  THESE THINGS  TOGETHER. WE CAN PROJECT  STEP BY STEP AND  THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY DEPUTY  MAYOR PHIL  THOMPSON. OUR NEW SECTOR  COUNCIL THAT  WE\'RE ADDING IS  THE CONSTRUCTION  AND REAL ESTATE. BIG, BIG PART OF  THIS CITY, THE  ECONOMY, BIG PART OF WHAT MAKES NEW YORK NEW YORK AS  WELL. AND WE WANT WANT  TO GET BACK AND  WORK AND WE WANT  TO GET THEM BACK  TO WORK. BUT HERE ARE A  SET OF CHALLENGES AS WELL. DIFFERENT KINDS  OF WORK, SOME OF  WHICH MIGHT LEND  ITSELF BETTER TO  SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SOME OF WHICH MIGHT BE BETTER  IN TERMS OF  HEALTH. OTHER WORK IN  THIS FIELD  PRESENTS MORE  CHALLENGES,  PARTICULARLY  INDOOR WORK. WE\'VE GOT TO  FIGURE OUT WHAT  KIND OF PERSONAL  PROTECTIVE  EQUIPMENT IS  NEEDED, WHAT KIND OF DISTANCE IS  NEEDED, WHAT KIND OF SCHEDULE IS  NEEDED TO GET  THIS RIGHT. THIS GROUP WILL  BE LED BY DEPUTY  MAYER LAURA  ENGLAND. AND THOSE ARE THE INITIAL COUNCILS  AND WE\'LL BE  PUTTING OUT THOSE NAMES. FOUR MORE COMING  BEHIND THAT. THE GOOD NEWS IS  THIS IS AN  EXAMPLE OF  LISTENING TO  PEOPLE WHO ARE  THE EXPERTS  BECAUSE THEY LIVE THE LIFE, THEY DO THE WORK, THEY  UNDERSTAND WHAT  EVERYONE IS GOING THROUGH. WE WANT TO HEAR  FROM THEM, WE  WANT TO HEAR  THEIR VOICES,  HELPING US  UNDERSTAND WHAT  WILL WORK. ALSO WARNING US  ABOUT WHAT MAY  NOT WORK. EVERYONE HAS THAT NEW YORK ENERGY,  A DESIRE TO GET  GOING. WE\'RE NEVER GOING TO LACK THAT. THESE FOLKS ARE  ALSO GOING TO  HELP US FIGURE  OUT HOW TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE AND  BASED ON REAL  EXPERIENCE AND  THEY WILL BE  PIVOTAL IN THE  EFFORT TO GET NEW YORK CITY GOING  AGAIN. I WANT TO SAY  THANK YOU IN  ADVANCE TO  EVERYONE WHO HAS  AGREED TO SERVE  ON THE ADVISORY  COUNCIL. WE\'RE GOING TO  ASK A LOT OF YOU  AND WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE FOR  YOUR WILLINGNESS  TO SERVE NEW YORK CITY. NOW, THAT IS   WE TALK ABOUT THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO TO GET READY  FOR THE RESTART  AND THE RECOVERY, BUT RIGHT NOW AS  WE\'RE DOING THAT  WORK, WE\'RE  FIGHTING EVERY  DAY AGAINST THIS  DISEASE, WE\'RE  FIGHTING EVERY  DAY TO MAKE SURE  THAT THE PEOPLE  OF THIS CITY ARE  KEPT WHOLE AND  SUPPOR, NO  MATTER WHAT THIS  HORRIBLE CRISIS  THROWS AT US, AND THAT MEANS BOTH  THE HEALTH CARE  CRISIS AND THE  ECONOMIC CRISIS. WE TALKED ABOUT  MANY TIMES OUR  PRIORITIES RIGHT  NOW. FOUR THINGS. PEOPLE\'S HEALTH,  SAFETY, MAKING  SURE EVERYONE HAS FOOD TO EAT,  MAKING SURE  EVERYONE HAS A  ROOF OVER THEIR  HEAD. IN THAT LAST  CATEGORY, WE ALL  KNOW THE  CHALLENGES THE  CITY HAS FACED  FOR DECADES IS  HOMELESSNESS. AND WE ALSO KNOW  THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS OFTEN DEFIED  CONVENTIONAL  SOLUTIONS. THAT\'S WHY WE  STAR TO DO  SOME  UNCONVENTIONAL  THINGS OVER THE  LAST YEARS. NOTHING MORE  POWERFUL THAN THE HOME STAT  STRATEGY AND THE  MORE IST VISION  CALLED THE  JOURNEY HOME,  WHICH IS ALL  OUT ENDING  PERMANENT STREET  HOMELESSNESS  THROUGH INTENSIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH  HOMELESS  INDIVIDUALS WHO  LIVE ON THE  STREET. WE\'VE SEEN SOME  THINGS START TO  WORK AND WHAT  WE\'VE TALKED  ABOUT IN RECENT  DAYS WAS  SOMETHING THAT  HAD CLEARLY NOT  WORKED FOR A LONG TIME, WHICH WAS  THE REALITY THAT  MANY HOMELESS  PEOPLE,  PARTICULARLY IN  COLDER MONTHS OF  THE YEAR, WILL GO INTO THE SUBWAYS  AND IN MANY CASES GOING ALL NIGHT  GOING BACK AND  FORTH ON THE  SUBWAY LINES. WHAT A HORRIBLE  SITUATION FOR  EVERYONE,  STARTING WITH  THAT HOMELESS  INDIVIDUAL. NOT SAFE, NOT  RIGHT, NOT RIGHT  FOR THE PEOPLE  AROUND THEM ON  THE SUBWAY TRAIN  EITHER. IN RECENT DAYS,  SOME NEW AND  IMPORTANT  THINKING HAS  EMERGED BECAUSE  OF THIS CRISIS  AND BECAUSE OF  THE CHALLENGES IT CREA AND  BECAUSE WE HAVE  TO THINK  DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW  KEEP MASS  TRANSIT RUNNING  AND HOW TO KEEP  IT SAFE AND CLEAN AND HOW TO  SUPPORT OUR  ESSENTIAL  WORKERS. THE GOVERNOR AND  I AND OUR TEAMS  AND EVERYONE AT  THE MTA, WE  WORKED ON THE  NOTION OF CLOSING THE SUBWAYS IN  THE OVERNIGHT  HOURS FOR DEEP  CLEANING AND ALSO AS A WAY TO  FACILITATE A  DIFFERENT KIND OF ENGAGEMENT WITH  THE HOMELESS. TO DISRUPT THAT  PATTERN THAT  EXIS FOR  DECADES AND WAS  GETTING US  NOWHERE. I\'LL TELL YOU  SOMETHING. LAST NIGHT WAS  THE FIRST NIGHT  THAT WE GOT TO  SEE SOME EVIDENCE OF WHAT WOULD  HAPPEN IF THE  SUBWAYS WERE  CLOSED IN THOSE  LATENIGHT HOURS, THE DEEP CLEANING WAS HAPPENING AND EVERYONE HAD TO  LEAVE THE  STATIONS,  INCLUDING  HOMELESS  INDIVIDUALS. WE ONLY HAVE AN  INITIAL SNAPSHOT  BECAUSE WE\'RE  TALKING ABOUT  SOMETHING THAT  JUST HAPPENED  HOURS AGO, BUT  THE INITIAL  SNAPSHOT IS A  POWERFUL AND  POSITIVE ONE. LAST NIGHT 139  HOMELESS  INDIVIDUALS OUT  OF 252 WHO WERE  ENGAGED BY OUR  OUTREACH WORKERS  AND BY THE NYPD  OFFICERS TRAINED, 139 INDIVIDUALS  AGREED TO ACCEPT  SUPPORT, ACCEPT  SERS AND COME IN OFF THE  STREETS, COME IN  OUT OF THE  SUBWAYS. THIS NUMBER IS  EXTRAORDINARY. FIRST OF ALL,  MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE  ENCOUNTERED AND  ENGAGED AGREED TO LEAVE THE  SUBWAYS, TO LEAVE THE STREETS AND  COME IN. THAT\'S AN AMAZING REALITY TO BEGIN  WITH. BUT WE HAVE, MORE IMPORTANTLY,  NEVER, EVER SEEN  SO MUCH SUCCESS  IN A SINGLE NIGHT BEFORE. WE\'VE NEVER SEEN  THIS MANY PEOPLE, THIS HIGH A  PERCENTAGE OF  PEOPLE WHO ARE  LIVING ON THE  STREET AGREE TO  SOMETHING  DIFFERENT. AND IT\'S ONLY ONE NIGHT. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED A LOT MORE  INFORMATION AND  WE NEED TO SEE  HOW THINGS PLAY  OUT OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME,  BUT THIS NUMBER  IS STAGGERING,  BECAUSE, LOOK,  CONSISTENTLY WHAT FEDERAL SURVEYS  HAVE SHOWN IS  THAT THIS CITY,  AND I DON\'T SAY  IT WITH ANYTHING  BUT SORROW, BUT  THE FACTS IN THE  ANNUAL SURVEY  SHOWS SOMEWHERE  BETWEEN 3,500 AND ,000 PEOPLE  LIVES ON OUR  STREETS AND  SUBWAYS COMBINED. IN ONE NIGHT 139  PEOPLE TOOK A  STEP TOWARDS  LEAVING THAT LIFE AND COMING IN TO  A SAFE HAVEN OR A SHELTER AND  STARTING THE  PROCESS OF  GETTING TO  LONGTERM HOUSING AND NEVER GOING  BACK ON THE  STREETS. THAT\'S AN  EXTRAORDINARY  NUMBER FOR ONE  NIGHT AND VERY  ENCOURAGING. WE HAVE TO  SUSTAIN IT IN  MANY, MANY WAYS. WE\'VE GOT A LOT  OF WORK TO DO. BUT I WANT TO SAY TO EVERYONE  INVOLVED, NYPD,  TO EVERYONE IN  SOCIAL SERS  AND HOMELESS  SERS, TO THE  MTA, TO THE  GOVERNOR\'S TEAM,  WE ALL WORKED  TOGETHER ON THIS  VISION IN HOPES  THAT IT WOULD  CREATE SOMETHING  NEW AND THE VERY  FIRST NIGHT WAS A VERY HOPEFUL  SIGN. SO WE\'RE GOING TO KEEP AT IT AND  HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF  SOMETHING MUCH  BIGGER AND REALLY GOOD FOR PEOPLE  ALL OVER THE  CITY, AND  PARTICULARLY FOR  THOSE WHO ENDED  UP ON OUR STREETS AND SUBWAYS WHO  WANT TO GET BACK  TO A BETTER LIFE. NOW, A RELA  POINT, I\'VE SAID  I WANT TO ALWAYS  GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE  WHEN OUR  COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDIA POINT OUT A PROBLEM THAT WE  NEED TO FIX. I ALWAYS  APPRECIATE  GETTING THAT KIND OF HEADSUP SO WE CAN DO SOMETHING  ABOUT IT. LUCKILY, WE\'RE  ABLE TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. YESTERDAY IT WAS  TALKED ABOUT  THREE ENCAMPMENTS OF HOMELESS  PEOPLE. WHENEVER YOU SAY  THE WORK  ENCAMPMENT, IT\'S  HOMELESS PEOP  WHO HAVE SET UP  SORT OF A  LONGTERM LIVING  ARRANGEMENT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT USED TO BE  COMMON ALL OVER  THE CITY. ABSOLUTELY  UNACCEPTABLE,  ABSOLUTELY NOT  RIGHT FOR THE  HOMELESS PEOPLE,  FOR THEIR HEALTH  AND SAFETY, NOT  RIGHT FOR THE  COMMUNITIES THEY  LIVE IN AND  EVERYONE AROUND. JUST NOT YET FOR  NEW YORK CITY,  AND FOR DECADES  IT WAS A NORM  THAT THESE CAMPS  EXIS AND WERE  NOT DISRUP. IN MY  ADMINISTRATION WE MADE A DECISION  THAT FROM OUR  POINT OF VIEW IT  IS UNACCEPTABLE  TO HAVE A SINGLE  ENCAMPMENT  ANYWHERE IN NEW  YORK CITY AND  THEY HAVE TO BE  DISMANTLED ANY  TIME THEY\'RE  IDENTIFIED AND  THEY\'VE BEEN  DOING TH NOW  FOR YEARS AND  IT\'S REALLY  CAUSED THE  ENCAMPMENTS TO  BECOME A RARITY. WHENEVER WE SEE A NEW ONE, WE  IMMEDIATELY TAKE  IT DOWN BECAUSE  IT\'S NOT FAIR TO  ANYONE AND IT\'S  NOT HEALTHY AND  SAFE. JULIETTE  IDENTIFIED THREE  ENCAMPMENTS  YESTERDAY  MORNING. I WANT TO THANK  THE DEPARTMENTS  THAT HAVE WORKED  TOGETHER TO  DISMANTLE THOSE  ENCAMPMENTS. THE PEOPLE WHO  ARE LIVING THERE  HAVE BEEN OFFERED HELP. SO THOSE THREE  CONDITIONS HAVE  BEEN ADDRESSED  AND ANYBODY IN  THE MEDIA, ANY  TIME YOU SEE  SOMETHING LIKE  THAT, WE WANT TO  DIRECT IT  IMMEDIATELY. NEW YORKERS, IF  YOU SEE ANY PLACE WHERE HOMELESS  FOLKS ARE  CONGREGATING WE  NEED TO KNOW SO  WE CAN GET OUT  AND ADDRESS IT. WE NEED TO GET  THE PEOPLE HELP  AND GET THEM OFF  THE STREET. WELL, SPEAKING OF STREETS, SOME  GOOD NEWS TODAY  AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE  OPEN STREETS  INITIATIVE. THIS IS AN  INITIATIVE. CITY COUNCIL PUT  THIS IDEA OUT  THERE. IT\'S AN IDEA THAT NOW IS READY TO  GO INTO HIGHER  GEAR. I WANT TO THANK  THE CITY COUNCIL  FOR THEIR  PARTNERSHIP AND  WANT TO THANK THE NYPD AND  DEPARTMENT OF  TRANSPORTATION  AND DEPARTMENT OF PARTS. ALL THE CITY  AGENCIES ARE  WORKING TOGETHER  TO MAKE THIS  WORK, AND THANK  GOD, ALL THOSE  CITY AGENCIES  HAVE MORE AND  MORE OF THEIR  EMPLOYEES COMING  BACK WHO HAD BEEN SICK WITH  COVID19. THE WORKFORCE IS  STRENGTHENED SO  WE CAN DO THIS  WITH THE RIGHT  KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT AND  MAKE THEM WORK  FOR EVERYONE. SO OVER THE LAST  FEW DAYS,  INCLUDING THE  WEEKEND, WE HAVE  OPENED OVER SEVEN MILES AND NOW  WE\'RE ADDING TWO  MORE MILES THAT  WILL BE OPEN  TOMORROW,  THURSDAY. IN THIS CASE,  THESE ARE  SPECIFIC SITES  THAT ARE BEING  MANAGED BY LOCAL  BUSINESS  IMPROVEMENT  DISTRICTS, SO  LOCAL  ORGANIZATIONS  THAT DO SUCH  IMPORTANT WORK  FOR THEIR  COMMUNITIES, AND  HAVE TAKEN  RESPONSIBILITY  THAT EVERYTHING  IS SET UP AND  MONITORED AND  SAFE. AND THEY WORK  VERY CLOSELY OF  COURSE WITH THE  NYPD AND DOT. I WANT TO THANK  THE FLAT IRON AND GARMENT DISTRICT  AND THE DOWNTOWN  BROOKLYN  PARTNERSHIP AND  THE THIRD AVENUE  IN THE BRONX. ALL OF THEM  STEPPED FORWARD  AND ARE GOING TO  ENSURE THAT THESE STREETS THAT YOU  CAN SEE ON THE  SLIDES WILL BE  OPEN STREETS,  AGAIN, STARTING  TOMORROW. I ALSO WANT TO  ANNOUNCE THAT ONE OPEN STREET THAT  WAS PART OF THE  VERY ORIGINAL  PILOT PROGRAM,  THIS ONE IS NOW  COMING BACK. IT\'S A HALF MILE  ALONG  JACKSONVILLE. THE PILOT  LOCATION IS NOW  BECOMING A  FULLTIME  LOCATION FOR THE  DURATION OF THIS  CRISIS. AND AGAIN, THIS  IS THE NEXT PHASE AND MORE TO COME  SOON AS WE BUILD. ANOTHER THING WE  ARE BUILDING OUT  ALL OVER NEW YORK CITY IS THE  INITIATIVE TO  DISTRIBUTE FREE,  SAFE COVERINGS TO ALL NEW YORKERS  WHO NEED IT. THIS IS GETTING A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE. PEOPLE ARE REALLY THANKFUL TO BE  GETTING FACE  COVERINGS AND THE MORE THEY GET,  THE MORE THEY\'RE  USING THEM, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT  WE WANT. I TOLD YOU THIS  WEEK EARLIER THAT THEY WOULD BE  DISTRIBUTING  7.5 MILLION FREE  FACE COVERINGS. AND THAT IS  REALLY GOING TO  MAKE A HUGE  IMPACT AND SO  PEOPLE WHO WANT  TO KNOW WHERE  THEY CAN GET  THEM, AGAIN WE  HAVE A MAP THAT  IDENTIFIES  LOCATIONS ALL  OVER THE CITY. WE\'VE ADDED A  NUMBER OF  LOCATIONS SINCE  THE WEEKEND. ALL YOU HAVE TO  DO IS GO TO  NYC.GOV/FACE COVERINGS AND YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER  OF PLACES WHERE  YOU CAN GET A  FACE COVERING TO  HELP PROTECT  EVERYONE. YOUR FAMILIES,  YOUR FELLOW NEW  YORKERS, TO HELP  DRIVE BACK THIS  DISEASE. NOW, I LIKE TO  EXPRESS MY THANKS EVERY DAY. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE DOING SO  MANY GOOD THINGS  IN THIS CITY. 8.6 MILLION  PEOPLE PULLING  TOGETHER TO FIGHT BACK THIS  DISEASE. WELL, TODAY IS  ONE OF THOSE  NATIONAL DAYS OF  THANKS FOR A  PARTICULAR GROUP  THAT HAS BEEN  JUST UNBELIEVABLY HEROIC, AND THAT  IS OUR NURSES. TODAY IS NATIONAL NURSES DAY. SO LISTEN,  UNBELIEVABLE,  ABSOLUTELY  BREATHTAKING WHAT THE NURSES OF NEW YORK CITY HAVE  DONE DURING THIS  CRISIS. THEY\'RE HEROS TO  THIS CITY AND  HEROS TO THIS  WHOLE NATION. SO I THINK IT\'S A FAIR STATEMENT IF THERE\'S ANY NEW  YORKER OUT THERE  OR ANY AMERICAN  OUT THERE WHO  DIDN\'T APPRECIATE OUR NURSES  BEFORE, WELL,  THEY DAMN SURE  WELL APPRECIATE  THEM NOW. AND THAT IS JUST  AND FAIR THAT  NURSES ARE  FINALLY GETTING  THE RECOGNITION  THEY DESERVE. BUT WE SURE WANT  TO DO MORE. I\'VE HAD THE JOY  OF GOING OUT TO A NUMBER OF OUR  HOSPITALS, PLACES LIKE ELMERS  HOSPITAL, KINGS  COUNTY HOSPITAL,  A NUMBER OF  OTHERS, TO  APPLAUD ALL THE  HEALTH CARE  WORKERS, TAKE A  SPECIAL  APPRECIATION  THANKING OUR  NURSES FOR WHAT  THEY\'VE DONE  HERE. AND EVERYONE  TODAY, WHEN YOU  SEE ANY HEALTH  CARE WORKER, BUT  PARTICULARLY  SINCE IT\'S THEIR  DAY, WHEN YOU SEE A NURSE, SAY THE  WORDS THANK YOU  AND SAY IT WITH  PASSION, BECAUSE  THEY DESERVE ALL  THE THANKS IN THE WORLD. NOW, I\'LL FRAME  WHAT WE DO EACH  DAY, OF COURSE,  GO OVER OUR DAILY INDICATORS. I\'LL FRAME THIS  BY SAYING NOT  EVERY DAY GOES  THE WAY WE PLAN  IT. THE BIG TREND IS  GOOD, BUT  DAYTODAY WE  STILL SEE  FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE SOBERING AND  IT\'S A REMINDER  DO NOT TAKE OUR  FOOT OFF THE GAS, DO NOT RELAX OUR  RULES UNTIL IT\'S  TIME, GET IT  RIGHT. FIGHT BACK THIS  DISEASE, AVOID  THAT BOOMERANG,  BECAUSE TODAY WE  SEE SOME NUMBERS  THAT REMIND US WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. SO ON THE FIRST  ONE, DAILY NUMBER OF PEOPLE  ADMIT TO THE  HOSPITAL FOR  SUSPEC  COVID19. THAT NUMBER HAS  GONE UP. IT\'S GONE UP  MARKEDLY, ALSO A  MUCH SMALLER  BUSINESS, SO FROM 75 TO 109. WE\'VE GOT TO SEE  THAT GO DOWN. THE NUMBER OF  PEOPLE IN ICUs  ACROSS OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS FOR  SUSPEC  COVID19, STILL  TOO LARGE A  NUMBER. THE INCREASE IS  SMALL FROM 596 TO 599. WE\'VE GOT TO GET  THAT NUMBER DOWN. THAT\'S ANOTHER  KEY PIECE OF THE  PUZZLE. VERY GOOD NUMBER  TO GO DOWN IS THE THIRD ONE, THE  PERCENTAGE OF  PEOPLE TESTING  POSITIVE FOR  COVID19, THAT IS DOWN FROM 22% TO  15%. OBVIOUSLY IT\'S A  UNIVERSAL MEASURE AND THAT IS A  GOOD EXAMPLE,  THAT\'S GOOD NEWS  TODAY. SO MORE FIGHT  AHEAD. WE WANT TO GET  ALL THESE NUMBERS GOING DOWN  TOGETHER. I AM CONVINCED WE WILL, BUT WE\'VE  GOT SOME MORE  WORK TO DO. SO THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO THAT WORD I STAR WITH,  MODERATION. THINK OF THE  VIRUS AGAIN, GIVE IT HUMAN  CHARACTERISTICS  FOR A MOMENT. THIS IS A VIRUS  THAT SEEKS OUT  OUR WEAKNESSES. I TALKED A FEW  DAYS AGO ABOUT  SOME BIG CITIES  IN ASIA THAT  STAR TO OPEN  UP A LITTLE TOO  FAST AND  UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO CLAMP BACK  DOWN AND IN FACT  ADD NEW  RESTRICTIONS. IN SOME CASES IT  WAS ONLY ONE PART OF THE CITY THAT  WAS A PROBLEM,  BUT IT BECAME A  PROBLEM FOR  EVERYONE. THIS DISEASE  LOOKS FOR OUR  WEAKNESSES AND  TRIES TO EXPLOIT  THEM. WE CAN\'T LET THAT HAPPEN. SO AGAIN, I SEE  ALL OVER THE CITY INCREDIBLE  DISCIPLINE AND  INCREDIBLE  ADHERENCE TO THE  RULES. I WANT EVEN MORE. I DON\'T WANT TO  LET THIS DISEASE  BACK IN THE DOOR. SO LET\'S KEEP  FIGHTING, BECAUSE I KNOW WE ALL  WANT THAT  RESTART, WE WANT  THAT RESTART AND  LET\'S GET IT  RIGHT RIGHT NOW,  AND WE\'LL DO IT  WITH MODERATION. THAT\'S HOW WE  MAKE SURE THAT  EVERY STEP WE  TAKE HOLDS AND  THEN WE TAKE THE  NEXT STEP. THAT\'S THE GAME  PLAN AND WE\'LL  HAVE A LOT MORE  TO SAY ON THIS IN THE COMING DAYS. A FEW WORDS IN  SPANISH. [ SPEAKING  FOREIGN LANGUAGE  ] SPEAKING FOREIGN  LANGUAGE. SPEAKING FOREIGN  LANGUAGE. >>> WITH THAT, WE ARE GOING TO TURN TO COLLEAGUES IN  THE MEDIA, AND AS ALWAYS, LET ME  KNOW THE OUTLET  OF EACH  JOURNALIST. >> JUST A QUICK  REMINDER ON THE  PHONE WE HAVE  DEPUTY MAY OR  BEAM,  COMMISSIONER  BANKS AND  TROTTENBERG AND  THE FIRST  QUESTION GOES TO  GLORIA FROM NEW  YORK ONE.  >> GOOD MORNING. MR. MAYOR, WE\'VE  HEARD THIS  MORNING, AND IT  WAS SAID 2,000  PEOPLE WERE  REMOVED  [ INAUDIBLE ] . I\'M WONDERING IF  YOU H ANY  INFORMON  THAT. AND OUT  THE  HOPES THAT YOU  WERLE TO  ENGAGE, CAN YOU  GIVE US AN IDEA  OF EXACTLY WHERE  THOSE PEOPLE WERE SENT? WHAT IS THE  RESOURCE THAT THE CITY IS USING AT  THIS TIME, AND  WHAT ARE YOU  DOING TO ENSURE  THAT THEY DON\'T  GO BACK ON THE  SUBWAYS WHEN THIS CRISIS IS OVER? >> GOT IT.  >> MY SECOND  QUESTION IS  THAT   >> TIMEOUT. GUYS, I REALLY  NEED EVERYONE TO  UNDERSTAND THIS. GLORIA, THAT\'S A  MULTIPART  QUESTION. WE\'RE GOING TO  STAY THERE WITH  THAT,  RESPECTFULLY. WE\'VE GOT THIS  RULE WHERE WE\'RE  TRYING TO GIVE AS MANY PEOPLE AN  OPPORTUNITY IN  THE TIME WE HAVE. THERE\'S A LOT  GOING ON THAT I  NEED TO GET BACK  TO EVERY DAY. SO I ORIGINALLY  SAID TO THESE  JOURNALISTS ONE  QUESTION. WE DECIDED TO  GIVE PEOPLE  ANOTHER QUESTION. WE\'RE TURNING  INTO THREE, FOUR, FIVE QUESTIONS. WE CAN\'T DO THAT. I\'M GOING TO MAKE SURE WE ANSWER  WHAT YOU JUST  ASKED. GREAT MULTIPART  QUESTION. WE\'RE GOING TO  ANSWER THAT AND  I\'M GOI T A  OU COLLEAGUES  WHO FOLLOW TO  PLEASE DO REALLY  LITERALLY ONE OR  TWO QUESTIONS. IF PEOPLE CAN\'T  DO THAT, THEN  WE\'RE GOING TO  HAVE TO CHANGE  THE FORMAT TO  MAKE IT SIMPLER,  BECAUSE WE JUST  NEED TO BE FAIR  TO EVERYONE. I WANT TO GET TO  AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. SO I\'M GOING TO  START AND THEN  TURN TO STEVE  BANKS. GLORIA, FROM WHAT I CAN SAY, AND I  WANT TO MAKE SURE WE\'RE SPEAKING  THE RIGHT  LANGUAGE HERE  ABOUT WHAT\'S  GOING ON. FIRST OF ALL,  AGAIN, VERY  THANKFUL FOR THE  COLLABORATION  WITH THE STATE  AND THE MTA. I THINK SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT IS HAPPENING. STEVE WILL BE  ABLE TO TELL YOU  EVERYTHING WE\'RE  DOING ONCE PEOPLE DO AGREE TO  SERS, BECAUSE IT\'S SOMETHING  THAT\'S BEEN BUILT OVER THREE YEARS, THE HOME  INITIATIVE. IT\'S A PRETTY  WELLOILED  MACHINE NOW WITH  GREAT RESULTS. SEVERAL THOUSAND  PEOPLE HAVE COME  IN OFF THE  STREETS AND NOT  COME BACK TO THE  STREETS. SO STEVE WILL  TALK TO ME ABOUT  WHAT WE DO WITH  PEOPLE TO MAKE  SURE THAT THEY  RECEIVE THOSE  SERS AND STAY TO THE MAXIMUM  EXTENT POSSIBLE. BUT TO THE  NUMBER, I WANT TO CAUTION THAT  AGAIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\'S  ANNUAL STUDY  THAT\'S RUN FOR A  LONG TIME, SAYS  THE TOTAL NUMBER  OF HOMELESS  PEOPLE IN NEW  YORK CITY ON THE  STREETS, ON THE  SUBWAYS, ALL FIVE BOROUGHS IS  BETWEEN 3,500 AND ,000. IN THE COLD  MONTHS, THE  WINTER MONTHS,  YOU SEE A LOT  MORE PEOPLE GO  INTO THE SUBWAYS. STEVE WILL GIVE  YOU HIS VIEW. HE\'S LITERALLY  ONE OF THE  LEADING EXPERTS  ON HOMELESSNESS  NOT ONLY IN NEW  YORK CITY, BUT IN THE UNI STATES OF AMERICA AND  HE\'S BEEN AT IT  FOR ABOUT 30  YEARS. WHEN I HEAR THAT  NUMBER, I RESPECT PAT A LOT. I LIKE HIM AND  RESPECT HIM. I DON\'T  UNDERSTAND HOW  THAT NUMBER COULD BE ACCURATE,  GIVEN WHAT WE  KNOW OF  HOMELESSNESS IN  THE CITY AND THIS TIME OF YEAR,  IT\'S HARD FOR ME  TO IMAGINE THAT  MANY PEOPLE THAT  ARE ACTUALLY  STREET HOMELESS. THAT\'S DIFFERENT  FROM PEOPLE WHO  MIGHT LIVE IN A  SHELTER OR APPEAR TO BE HOMELESS  BUT MAY NOT BE  HOMELESS. BUT THAT NUMBER  SURPRISES ME IS  ALL I\'LL SAY. BUT STEVE, YOU\'RE THE EXPERT. TELL US WHAT YOU  THINK OF THAT.  >> STEVE, CAN YOU HEAR ME? >> THERE YOU GO. >> I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE SAW LAST  NIGHT OUT IN THE  FIELD. WE WERE DOWN AT  THE WORLD TRADE  CENTER AND OTHER  LOCATIONS WORKING WITH THE STAFF. WE ENCOUNTERED  NORTH OF 250  PEOPLE AND ABOUT  60% OF THEM CAME  INSIDE AND WE  HAVE SHELTERS AND SAFE HAVENS. SO WE\'RE  PROVIDING THE  SAME SERS TO  THE PEOPLE LAST  NIGHT THAT  ENABLED US TO  BRING 2,500  PEOPLE OFF THE  STREET WHO  REMAINED OFF THE  STREET, AND  THAT\'S REALLY THE KEY METRIC. AND LOOK, SOME  PEOPLE MAY  RETURN, BUT WE\'LL BE BACK EVERY  NIGHT OFFERING A  HELPING HAND TO  GET THEM OFF THE  STREET HOPING FOR SUCCESS THAT  WE\'VE HAD OVER A  PERIOD OF TIME. BUT I ALSO WANT  TO PUT THE  NUMBERS IN  CONTEXT. AND AGAIN, WE  APPRECIATE THE  COLLABORATION  WITH NYPD AND THE SOCIAL SERS  STAFF. HALF THE PEOPLE  THAT YOU SEE IN  THE SUBWAYS ARE  TRANSIENT,  MEANING ONE OR  TWO NIGHTS, AND  YOU MAY NOT SEE  THEM AGAIN. LAST NIGHT THERE  WAS A FOCUS ON  THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE LONGTERM ON  THE SUBWAYS. SO THAT\'S WHY I  THINK THE SUCCESS OF LAST NIGHT   GRAN IT\'S ONLY ONE NIGHT,  BRINGING IN 139  PEOPLE IS REALLY  WHAT WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON, THE  HUMAN BEINGS THAT ARE IN THE SUBWAY AND HAVE BEEN  THERE FOR A LONG  PERIOD OF TIME,  AS OPPOSED TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  THERE ONE OR TWO  NIGHTS AND YOU  NEVER SEE THEM  AGAIN. THAT\'S THE  PERCEPTION THAT  THERE\'S LOTS OF  PEOPLE THERE FOR  LONG PERIODS OF  TIME. OUR FOCUS IS ON  THE PEOPLE THAT  ARE REALLY THERE  A LONG PERIOD OF  TIME AND THOSE  ARE THE PEOPLE WE BROUGHT IN LAST  NIGHT.  >> STEVE, IF YOU  COULD TAKE ONE  MORE STEP IN THAT ANSWER, I THINK  WE ALL WANT TO  UNDERSTAND A  LITTLE BIT  BETTER. AGAIN, HEARING AN ESTIMATE OF  SEVERAL THOUSAND, MY QUESTION, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE  IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT COULD ALL BE STREET HOMELESS  FOLKS OR DO YOU  ASSUME THAT\'S  SOME COMBINATION  OF PEOPLE THAT IS STREET HOMELESS  AND OTHER KIND OF FOLKS? >> I THINK  EXPERIENCE TELLS  YOU THAT PEOPLE  END UP ON THE  STREETS FOR  PERIODS OF TIME  OR ARE PERCEIVED  FOR ALL RANGE OF  ECONOMIC REASONS, BUT THEY\'RE NOT  THE PEOPLE THAT  YOU SEE EVERY  DAY. THOSE ARE THE  PEOPLE THAT YOU  SEE EVERY DAY  THAT WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON IN THE PLAN. SO SOMEONE WHO  NIGHT BE  PANHANDLING, FOR  EXAMPLE, MAY WELL HAVE A HOME. I THINK THAT  PEOPLE MAKE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS  WHEN THEY SEE  PEOPLE AND ASSUME THAT THEY DON\'T  HAVE A ROOF OVER  THEIR HEADS. WHAT WE\'RE DOING  WITH OUR SOCIAL  SERS STAFF IS ACTUALLY  DETERMINING WHICH INDIVIDUAL,  INDIVIDUAL BY  INDIVIDUAL, NEEDS OUR SERS THAT WE CAN BRING  INSIDE. AND SOMETIMES IT  ALL GETS LOST IN  LARGE NUMBERS. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT\'S ABOUT  HUMAN BEINGS AND  ON A CASEBYCASE BASIS AND WE\'LL  KEEP DOING THAT.  >> NEXT IS MARCIA FROM CB S2. GOOD MORNING,  MR. MAYOR, HOW  ARE YOU DOING? >> GOOD, MARCIA. HOW ARE YOU? >> GOOD. MY FIRST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH  SOCIAL DISTANCING ENFORCEMENT. AS YOU\'RE WELL  AWARE WILLIAMS  AND ADAMS, THE  NYPD ENFORCEMENT  OF SOCIAL  DISTANCING HAS  SHOWN DISPARITIES THAT THE  ENFORCEMENT HAS  BEEN SUBJECTIVE  AND SELECTIVE AND THEY WANT YOU TO  RELEASE DATA. I WONDER YOUR  TAKE ON IT AND IF YOU\'VE GIVEN ANY  INSTRUCTIONS TO  THE NYPD IN TERMS OF THE GUIDELINES FOR WHO GETS  APPROACHED AND  WHO GETS SUMMONS. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION HAS TO  DO WITH THE  HOMELESS AGAIN. HOMELESS  ADVOCATES ARE  SAYING THAT  YOU\'RE TAKING  HOMELESS PEOPLE  OFF THE SUBWAY  BUT NOT PROVIDING THEM WITH SAFE  ALTERNATIVES. YOUR RESPONSE TO  THAT? >> THANK YOU,  MARCIA. NO, I  RESPECTFULLY  DISAGREE  PROFOUNDLY WITH  THOSE ADVOCATES. I APPRECIATE  THEIR WORK, BUT  AGAIN, STEVE  BANKS LEADING OUR EFFORTS TO HELP  THE HOMELESS, ONE OF THE PREMIER  ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS FOR  DECADES IN THE  CITY AND THIS  COUNTRY. AND WHAT STEVE  HAS CREA WAS A TEAM. AND WITH ALL THE  AMAZING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND THROUGH THE  OUTREACH IS  SOMETHING  UNPRECEDEN IN  THE HISTORY OF  THE CITY AND IT  IS COMPASSIONATE  AND DECENT AND  IT\'S ABOUT  HELPING HOMELESS  FOLKS GET TO A  SAFE HAVEN OR A  SHELTER THAT  WORKS FOR THEM. WE\'VE BEEN ADDING SO MANY MORE  SPACES IN PLACES  THAT HOMELESS  PEOPLE  YOU  KNOW, WHERE WE  FIND THEM, SO WE  HAVE PLACES THAT  WORK FOR THEM. WE PROVIDE  MEDICAL CARE,  FOOD, SUBSTANCE  ABUSE SUPPORT IN  TERMS OF PROGRAMS TO GET THEM OFF  SUBSTANCES. MENTAL HEALTH  SERS. IT\'S  EXTRAORDINARILY  COMPASSIONATE AND WE KNOW IT\'S  EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OVER 2,000 PEOPLE HAVE COME IN AND  NOT GONE BACK TO  THE STREETS. AND I WOULD THINK THE ADVOCATE  WOULD WANT TO  APPLAUD AND  SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT IS ENDING  STREET  HOMELESSNESS AND  HAS NEVER BEEN  DONE IN THE CITY  B ANDE\' P HUUNOF RESOURIN AND \'S CLERL  WORKING. AND THIS NEW  OPPORTUNITY  BECAUSE OF THE  COLLABORATION  WITH THE MTA I  THINK IS GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR  WIDER TO GETTING  MORE PEOPLE OFF  THE STREETS. ON THE QUESTION  OF THE NYPD, I\'VE BEEN IN TOUCH  WITH BOTH, THE  BOROUGH PRESIDENT AND PUBLIC  ADVOCATE, WHO HAD CONSTRUCTIVE  CONVERSATIONS. I UNDERSTAND THE  CONCERN 100%. I WANT TO SEE  FAIR AND EQUAL  POLICING  EVERYWHERE. THAT\'S WHAT WE\'VE BEEN DEVO TO  NOW FOR OVER SIX  YEARS. CHANGING THE  NATURE OF  POLICING IN NEW  YORK TO MAKE IT  FOCUSED ON BEING  RESPECTFUL AND  RESPONSIVE TO  EVERY COMMUNITY  AND MORE DEEPLY  CONNEC TO  EVERY COMMUNITY. AND I THINK IT IS WORKING. I THINK THE  CHALLENGE WE ALL  HAVE WITH THIS  PANDEMIC IS WE\'RE LEARNING NOW WAYS AND APPROACHES. I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY ON HOW  WE\'RE GOING TO  REFINE OUR  APPROACH,  PARTICULARLY WITH WARMER MONTHS,  BUT THE MESSAGE  IS BE CONSISTENT  AMONG ALL  COMMUNITIES AND  COMMUNICATE WITH  PEOPLE, AS  ALWAYS, WITH  NEIGHBORHOOD  POLICING, HELP  PEOPLE TO  UNDERSTAND THIS  IS ABOUT THEIR  OWN HEALTH AND  SAFETY AND THEIR  FAMILIES. AND THE VAST  MAJORITY OF  PEOPLE, MARCIA,  ARE ACCEPTING  THESE RULES AND  FOLLOWING THESE  RULES. IT\'S ACTUALLY  BEEN QUITE RARE THT NYPD OR  ANY OTHER AGENCY  ENCOUNTERS MUCH  RESISTANCE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW YORKERS  GET IT AND  THEY\'RE LIVING  THIS WAY. SOMETIMES THEY  HAVE TO BE  REMINDED, BUT  THEY ACCEPT AND  REACT  ACCORDINGLY. WE DEFINITELY  WANT TO GET THE  DATA OUT. SO WE WILL MAKE  SURE THE NYPD  GETS THE DATA  OUT. IT\'S GOING TO  SHOW YOU WHERE  THERE HAVE BEEN  SUMMONS, BUT  THERE HASN\'T BEEN A NEED TO DO A  LOT OF SUMMONS IN THE LAST TWO  MONTHS FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING. THAT\'S A GOOD  THING. BUT DEFINITELY  THAT KIND OF  TRANSPARENCY WILL BE PROVIDED.  >> MATT IS UP  NEXT. MATT. >> GOOD MORNING,  MAYOR. TWO QUESTIONS. FIRST, THIS  MORNING ON TV YOU SAID THEY\'RE  PREPARING FOR  FURLOUGHS AND  LAYOFFS. HOW MANY PEOPLE  ARE YOU PREPARING TO FURLOUGH OR  LAYOFF. AND SECONDLY,  ABSENT A CRIME,  IF TWO PEOPLE WHO LIVE TOGETHER  HAVE A RIGHT TO  BE IN PUBLIC  WITHOUT  PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING, YES  OR NO? >> SO MATT, ON  THE SOCIAL  DISTANCING ISSUE, THE WAY I\'VE  UNDERSTOOD IT  FROM THE  BEGINNING, AND  DR. BARBOT CAN  COMMENT ON THIS,  TOO, THAT IF  PEOPLE ARE  ALREADY ENTIRELY  EXPOSED TO EACH  OTHER ALL DAY  LONG IN THEIR  HOUSEHOLD, SOCIAL DISTANCING IS A  DIFFERENT CONCEPT THAN IT IS FOR  FOLKS WHO ARE NOT EXPOSED TO EACH  OTHER. IF YOU\'RE ALREADY IN CONSTANT  CONTACT WITH  SOMEONE, IT DOES  NOT REQUIRE THE  SAME APPROACH AS  IF TWO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIVE UNDER THE SAME  HOUSEHOLD  SAME ROOF, LIKE YOU  SAY, COME IN  CONTACT. SO OUR FOCUS IN  ENFORCEMENT IS TO MAKE SURE, FIRST  AND FOREMOST,  THERE\'S NOT LARGE GATHERINGS, NOT  ANY KIND OF  GATHERINGS. SECOND, THAT  SOCIAL DISTANCING IS RECOGNIZED. THIRD, THAT  PEOPLE HAVE FACE  COVERINGS ON, IN  THAT ORDER. ON THE QUESTION  OF FURLOUGHS AND  LAYOFFS, WHAT I  SAID THIS MORNING IS I\'VE BEEN  TALKING TO MAYORS ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY,  REPUBLICAN AND  DEMOCRAT BOTH. SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS AND SOME  OF THEM HAVE  ALREADY ANNOUNCED FURLOUGHS. SOME OF THEM ARE  PLANNING TO. EVERY ONE OF US  HAS TO START  LOOKING AT THAT  POSSIBILITY IF WE DON\'T HAVE ANY  MONEY. WE HAVE A BUDGET  COMING UP IN  JUNE. I\'M NOT HERE TO  PROJECT ANYTHING  WHILE WE\'RE IN  THE MIDDLE OF  FIGHTING FOR THE  STIMULUS FUNDING, BECAUSE THAT\'S  WHAT WILL GET US  OUT OF THIS MESS  AND THAT\'S WHAT  NEW YORK CITY  DESERVES. THAT\'S WHAT  EVERYONE  DESERVES. THE STIMULUS  MONEY MAKES US  WHOLE AND  REPLACES ALL THE  LOST REVENUE AND  ALLOWS US TO  RETAIN OUR  WORKFORCE AND  MAKE SURE THAT  PUBLIC SERS  ARE BEING  PROVIDED, BASIC  SERS SO WE  CAN GET ON WITH  THE RESTART AND  RECOVERY. I\'VE BEEN TALKING NONSTOP TO OUR  MEMBERS OF THE  CONGRESSIONAL  DELEGATION. I SPEAK TO  SPEAKER PELOSI ON SUNDAY. WE NEED TO GET  THAT STIMULUS  DONE SO THAT  PEOPLE DON\'T HAVE TO EXPERIENCE  FURLOUGHS,  LAYOFFS. IF IT DOESN\'T  HAPPEN AND WE\'RE  MISSING  $7. BILLION IN  REVENUE, THEN ALL OPTIONS ARE ON  THE TABLE. BUT IT\'S NOT TIME TO TALK ABOUT  THAT YET.  >> ERIN FROM  POLITICO IS NEXT. >> ON THE  QUESTION OF  HOMELESS PEOPLE  ON THE SUBWAY, DOq I UNDERSTAND  CORRECTLY THESE  FOLKS IF THEY  ACCEPT YOUR  OFFER, THEY\'RE  BEING SENT TO  SHELTERS, AND IS  THERE ANY  CONSIDERATION OF  OFFERING THEM A  HOTEL ROOM, IF  THAT MIGHT BE  SAFER THAN  SHELTERS? >> AGAIN I\'M  GOING TO TURN TO  COMMISSIONER  BANKS, BUT I WANT TO NOTE THAT OVER THESE LAST  YEARS  THAT\'S  ANOTHER THING  THAT DIDN\'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION  AND IT REALLY  SHOULD HAVE. I\'M PUTTING IT  INTO THE LIGHT  NOW. FOR DECADES THERE WAS A BAD  DIVISION OF  LABOR, I THINK,  IN THE CITY WHERE SHELTERS THAT  NEEDED POSITIVE  INFLUENCE IN THE  NYPD DIDN\'T HAVE  IT. AND SOME YEARS  AGO WE MADE THE  DECISION, AND I  REALLY WANT TO  THANK THE NYPD  FOR SEEING HOW  IMPORTANT THIS  WAS. TO HAVE THE NYPD, GO INTO THE  SHELTERS,  SUPERVISE AND  TRAIN THE STAFF  AND HAVE A  PRESENCE. THAT\'S BEEN  TREMENDOUSLY  HELPFUL IN TERMS  OF MAKING  SHELTERS SAFER. ON TOP OF THAT,  WE INVES IN  THE SAFE HAVENS,  WHICH ARE MUCH  SMALLER  FACILITIES. SO I THINK WE  HAVE TO KEEP IN  MIND THAT THE  REALITIES OF OUR  SHELTER SYSTEM  ARE DIFFERENT  THAN WHAT THEY  WERE A FEW YEARS  AGO, DIFFERENT  ALSO BECAUSE WE  HAVE MORE SAFE  HAVEN. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT  THE INDIVIDUAL  AND WHAT THEY  NEED. STEVE CAN SPEAK  ABOUT IT MORE  ELOQUENTLY THAN  ME. BUT DEPENDING ON  THE INDIVIDUAL,  THEY NEED CERTAIN SERS AND  SUPPORT. SOME PEOPLE COULD FIT IN A HOTEL  ROOM FINE AND  OTHERS MAY NOT  AND MAY NEED  SUPERVISION AND  SUPPORT. WE\'RE TAILORING  IT. WE HAVE HOTEL  ROOMS AVAILABLE  BUT THE DECISION  BECOMES  CASEBYCASE. STEVE, WHY DON\'T  YOU JUMP IN.  >> IF I COULD  JUST ADD TO THAT, I THINK IT\'S  IMPORTANT TO  UNDERSTAND THE  RANGE OF TOOLS WE NOW HAVE TO MEET  PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND HELP  PEOPLE COME IN  FROM THE STREETS. IN TERMS OF OUR  OVERALL SHELTER  SYSTEM, RIGHT NOW 7,000 OF SINGLE  ADULTS OUT OF THE 17,000 SINGLE  ADULTS ARE  ACTUALLY IN  COMMERCIAL HOTEL  ROOMS AS PART OF  SOME ISSUES THAT  PRECEDED COVID19 AND SOME THAT  HAVE BEEN PUT IN  PLACE SINCE  COVID19, AND  WE\'RE CONTINUING  TO MOVE PEOPLE  OUT OF THE  SHELTERS INTO  COMMERCIAL HOTEL  ROOMS AND THAT  WILL CONTINUE. SO COMING INTO  OUR REGULAR  SHELTERS, THERE  ARE PATHWAYS TO  GET INTO A  COMMERCIAL HOTEL  ROOM, WHICH WE\'RE BRINGING ONLINE  EVERY DAY. IN TERMS OF THE  TOOLS THAT WE  HAVE TO BRING  PEOPLE INTO OUR  TRADITIONAL  SHELTERS, WE\'VE  ADDED COMMERCIAL  HOTEL ROOMS TO  THAT SYSTEM. WE ALSO HAVE THE  SAFE HAVEN BEDS  AND STABILIZATION BEDS WHICH ARE IN HOTELS NOW THAT  HAVE ENABLED US  TO BRING THE  PEOPLE IN OFF THE STREETS OVER THE  PAST SEVERAL  YEARS AND PEOPLE  ARE ACCEPTING  THOSE BEDS EVERY  NIGHT, PEOPLE  FROM THE STREETS. AND I THINK WE  ANNOUNCED A WEEK  AGO THAT EVEN  DURING THE  PANDEMIC, WE\'VE  ADDED ANOTHER 200 BEDS IN THE SAFE  HAVENS AS A  PATHWAY OFF THE  STREETS FOR HUMAN BEINGS. SO THERE ARE A  RANGE OF OPTIONS  FROM OUR SHELTER  SYSTEM NOW HAS,  SOME OF WHICH WE  DIDN\'T HAVE  BEFORE, AND  THEY\'RE USING ALL THESE TOOLS TO  TRY TO BRING  PEOPLE IN FROM  OFF THE STREETS. >> DEBRA LEE. >> GOOD MORNING,  EVERYONE. CAN YOU HEAR ME? >>.  >> YEAH, DEBRA  LEE. HOW ARE YOU  DOING? >> I\'M WELL. THANK YOU. I WAN TO  FOLLOW UP,  MR. MAYOR, AND  I\'M NOT SURE IF  COMMISSIONER SHEA IS ON, BUT I  WAN TO FOLLOW  UP ON THE  CONVERSATION  ABOUT THE  ENFORCEMENT ON  SOCIAL  DISTANCING. SPECIFICALLY  ABOUT THA  THAT YOU\'VE GOT  BOTH THE  PRESIDENT PAT  LYNCH AND OTHERS  SAYING THAT  THERE\'S JUST NOT  ENOUGH CLARITY  AROUND THE  GUIDANCE, THAT  THERE AREN\'T  RULES FOR WHAT  POLICE OFFE A PD   DO WHEN THEY  APPROACH PEOPLE  FOR VIOLATION OF  SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES. MOREOVER, OTHERS  ARE SAYING THIS  IS ANOTHER  OPPORTUNITY FOR  SUBJECTIVE  POLICING AND  PARTICULARLY AS  THE WARMER MONTHS APPROACH THAT  IT\'S GOING TO  BECOME ANOTHER  OPPORTUNITY FOR  MISTAKES. THAT SAID, CAN  YOU SPEAK TO THE  FACT THAT OTHERS  ARE CALLING FOR  OTHER AGENCIES,  THE OTHER  INDIVIDUALS TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS  OTHER THAN POLICE OFFICERS, THAT  THIS IS IN FACT  NOT A POLICING  CONVERSATION, BUT PARTICULARLY  YOU\'VE GOT MORE  PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREETS, THAT  THIS SHOULD  BECOME A CITYWIDE CONVERSATION  ACROSS OTHER  AGENCIES? AND THEN FINALLY, I WAN TO ASK  THE COMMISSIONER  BARBOT, WITH  PARENTS CONCERNED ABOUT VISITING  DOCTORS, WHAT  GUIDANCE IS THE  CITY OFFERING FOR PARENTS WHO WANT  TO MAKE SURE  THEIR CHILDREN  ARE VACCINA ON TIME AND  RECEIVING THE  VISITS THAT THEY  NEED IN LIGHT OF  THE FACT THAT  THERE IS NOW  KAWASAKI AND  THEY\'RE ASKING  PEOPLE NOT TO  TRAVEL AND VISIT  DOCTORS UNLESS  THEY ABSOLUTELY  NEED TO? >> I\'M GOING TO  LET DR. BARBOT  ANSWER THAT AND  I\'LL DOUBLE BACK  TO THE POLICING  ANSWER. I\'VE BEEN VERY  STRUCK ALREADY,  DEBORAH LEE, BY  VISITS TO A  COUPLE OF OUR  CLINICS, IN SOUTH BRONX AND CONEY  ISLAND, THAT THEY ARE REPORTING SO  MUCH MORE USE OF  TELEMEDICINE IN  THIS CRISIS AND  THAT IS ACTUALLY  GETTING EVERYONE  MORE USED TO  USING IT AND A  LOT OF THE  PATIENTS, A LOT  OF THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE CLINIC  ARE GETTING MORE  COMFORTABLE WITH  THAT OPTION. SO EVEN AS WE\'RE  NAVIGATING, THE  PEOPLE LIMITING  TRAVEL ARE NOT  BEING WILLING TO  GO OUT, I DO  THINK WE\'RE  SEEING MORE USE  OF TELEMEDICINE  IN A HELPFUL WAY  AND IT\'S  SOMETHING WE WANT TO DEEPEN IN OUR  EFFORTS AS WELL. WE\'LL HAVE MORE  TO SAY ON THAT  SOON. BUT IN TERMS OF  HOW TO ADVISE  PARENTS,  COMMISSIONER  BARBOT WILL JUMP  IN AND THEN I\'LL  COME BACK ON THE  OTHER QUESTION.  >> YES, THE  QUESTION IS A  CRITICALLY  IMPORTANT ONE. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE HEAR NEW  INFORMATION THAT  IS POTENTIALLY  SCARY FOR  PARENTS, LIKE  KAWASAKI OR THAT  TYPE OF SYNDROME, IT CAN MAKE  PARENTS MORE  HESITANT OR  CONCERNED ABOUT  WHAT THEY SHOULD  BE DOING FOR  THEIR CHILDREN. SO I WAN TO  CLARIFY THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE  HEARING ABOUT  KAWASAKI MORE AND MORE, IT STILL  REMAINS A  RELATIVELY RARE  CONDITION AND WE  WANT TO DRAW  ATTENTION TO IT  BECAUSE DURING  THIS TIME IT CAN  BE CONFUSED WITH  OTHER THINGS AND  WE WANT TO LOSE  TIME IN TERMS OF  CHILDREN GETTING  TO TREATMENT THAT CAN BE  DEFINITIVE. IN ADDITION, WE  WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY  PARENTS, BUT  MOTHERS IN  CHILDREN, KNOW  THAT HEALTH CARE  IS OPEN FOR  BUSINESS. WE WANT NEW  YORKERS TO SEEK  CARE FOR  CONDITIONS THAT  THEY MAY HAVE  THAT THEY\'VE HAD  TO PUT OFF. AS THE MAYOR  SAID, IT DOESN\'T  NECESSARILY MEAN  GOING TO THE  OFFICE IN PERSON, BUT IT COULD MEAN HAVING ACCESS, IT COULD BE A WHOLE  HOST OF WAYS IN  WHICH MEDICAL  PRACTICES ARE NOW ADJUSTING TO  SOCIAL DISTANCING AND HOW THEY  CONDITION TO SEE  PATIENTS AND  ENSURE THAT THEY  HAVE ONGOING  CARE. SO THAT ALSO  EXTENDS TO  CHILDREN GOING TO THEIR  PEDIATRICIANS TO  GET THEIR  NECESSARY  VACCINATIONS. WE WANT THEM TO  CONTINUE TAKING  CHILDREN TO THEIR PEDIATRICIAN AND  ENSURE THAT THEY  HAVE THE PROPER  FACE COVERINGS  WHEN THEY GO. WE ARE WORKING  WITH CLINICAL  PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY  ARE ALSO  AVAILABLE TO  PROVIDE PATIENTS  WITH NECESSARY  VACCINATIONS. WE ARE VERY MUCH  ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO MAKE SURE  PARENTS KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD BE  BRINGING THEIR  CHILDREN IN TO  GET THEIR VAX    NATIONS AS  SCHEDULED. WE DON\'T WANT  CHILDREN GETTING  INFECTIONS OR  CONDITIONS THAT  ARE  VACCINE PREVENTABLE. SO THAT\'S A  REALLY IMPORTANT  QUESTION AND IT\'S AN OPPORTUNITY  FOR US TO GET OUT THE MESSAGE THAT  MEDICINE IS OPEN  FOR BUSINESS AND  THAT PRACTICES  ARE SEEING  PATIENTS FOR  THINGS OTHER THAN COVID AND THAT  THERE ARE WAYS TO CONDUCT THESE  VISITS THAT DON\'T ALWAYS NEED AN  INPERSON VISIT. >> GOOD MORNING,  MR. MAYOR. YOU DIDN\'T REALLY ANSWER THE FIRST  PART OF DEBRA  LEE\'S QUESTION.  >> JEFF, HOLD UP, I MEANT TO AND I  GOT CAUGHT UP IN  OTHER THINGS. MY APOLOGY AND  THEN WE\'LL COME  BACK TO YOUR  QUESTION. YES, DEBRA LEE,  ON THE PREVIOUS. SO AGAIN, WE ARE  DEALING WITH  SOMETHING THAT IS ENTIRELY NEW  STILL TO ALL OF  US. IT\'S GOING TO  TAKE TIME TO GET  IT AS GOOD AS IT  SHOULD BE. BUT I THINK THE  CORE REALITIES  ARE STILL STRONG, MEANING WE HAVE  FOR YEARS NOW  BUILT UP A  PHILOSOPHY OF  NEIGHBORHOOD  POLICING. WE HAVE A WHOLE  NEW GENERATION OF POLICE OFFICERS  WHO HAVE BEEN  TRAINED IN THIS,  ALL THE ENTIRE  FORCE HAS BEEN  TRAINED IN THIS  PHILOSOPHY IN  DEESCALATION. I THINK WE\'VE  SEEN TWO MONTHS  NOW OF THE NYPD  ENGAGING THE  PEOPLE OF THE  CITY IN THE  CONTEXT OF THE  CORONAVIRUS. AND I HAVE TO SAY I OBVIOUSLY EVERY DAY AM LISTENING  FOR WHAT IS  WORKING AND  WHAT\'S NOT. WE\'VE SEEN A  COUPLE OF REALLY  UNUNFORTUNATE AND INAPPROPRIATE  INSTANCES, BUT  ONLY IN MY VIEW A VERY SMALL NUMBER COMPARED TO THE  VAST NUMBER OF  INTERACTIONS  BETWEEN THE  OFFICERS IN OUR  COMMUNITIES THAT  HAVE GONE THE  RIGHT WAY. AND I WANT TO  KEEP THINGS IN  EXPECTIVE. OUR OFFICERS ARE  TRYING TO  UNDERSTAND HOW TO BE EFFECTIVE IN  THIS PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO DO  MORE TO CREATE  CLEAR, SIMPLE  PROTOCOLS AND  MAKE SURE THEIR  SUPERVISORS ARE  SUPPORTING THEM. WE ALSO HAVE TO  REMEMBER THAT FOR WEEKS WE HAD THE  NYPD MISSING A  HUGE PERCENTAGE  OF ITS OFFICERS  BECAUSE OF THE  DISEASE. WE\'RE NOW COMING  TO A SITUATION  WHERE THE FORCE  IS COMING BACK TO ITS NORMAL  LEVELS. WE\'RE GETTING  MORE AND MORE  EXPERIENCE WITH  WHAT WORKS, WHAT  DOESN\'T WORK IN  TERMS OF TRYING  TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT. THE HIERARCHY I  PRESENT IS WE\'RE  MOST CONCERNED  ABOUT LARGER  GATHERINGS. THAT\'S WHERE THE  MOST DANGER IS. AND THEN  ENFORCING SOCIAL  DISTANCING ON A  MORE INDIVIDUAL  LEVEL AND THEN  THE FACE  COVERINGS. AND MOST  PEOPLE  THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE,  AND I\'VE CHECKED  THIS MANY TIMES  OVER WITH  COMMUNITY LEADERS AND WITH THE  NYPD. MOST PEOPLE, WHEN ASKED TO CREATE  MORE DISTANCE  FROM THE PEOPLE  AROUND THEM OR  ARE ASKED TO PUT  ON A FACE  COVERING, THEY\'RE DOING IT. SO WE\'RE NOT  HAVING OVERALL A  COMPLIANCE  PROBLEM. WE DO NEED TO  GIVE CLEAR  GUIDANCE, AND TO  THE OTHER POINT,  WE DEFINITELY  WANT TO BRING  COMMUNITY LEADERS AND COMMUNITY  ORGANIZATIONS  MUCH MORE DEEPLY  INTO THIS. PREVIOUSLY WHEN  THE VIRUS WAS ON  THE CONSTANT  UPSWING, THAT  WASN\'T OUR FOCUS, OBVIOUSLY. NOW THAT WE\'RE  GETTING SOME  RELIEF, IT\'S  SOMETHING WE CAN  DO MORE AND MORE, AND OBVIOUSLY DUE TO THE WARMER  WEATHER IT MAKES  SENSE TO DO IT  MORE AND MORE. WE\'LL HAVE MORE  TO SAY ON THAT IN THE COMING DAYS  AS WELL. NOW JEFF. >> THANKS. JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT QUESTION, THE INTERACTIONS  WE\'VE SEEN  BETWEEN POLICE  AND ENFORCEMENT  OF INDIVIDUALS  SOCIAL  DISTANCING, DO  YOU THINK THAT  THERE\'S A BENEFIT TO THAT  ENFORCEMENT OR  DOES IT OUTWEIGH  THE RISK OF THESE NEGATIVE  INTERACTION IS? AND THEN  SECONDLY, O THE  SUBWAY, WHAT ARE  YOUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT A RETURN TO 2HOUR SER? DO YOU HAVE ANY  SORT OF TIMELINE  AND DO YOU EXPECT THE 2HOUR  SER WILL  EVENTUALLY  RETURN? >> YES, JEFF,  ABSOLUTELY. THAT\'S A  CONVERSATION THE  GOVERNOR AND I  HAD AS PART OF  THE DECISION TO  MOVE TO THE  OVERNIGHT  CLEANING. HE WAS CLEAR, I  WAS CLEAR, WE  WERE TOTALLY  UNIFIED, THAT WE  WILL RETURN TO  2HOUR SER. OBVIOUSLY THE  STATE RUNS THE  MTA, BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT  WAS PREREQUISITE  TO THE CITY  AGREEING TO THIS  PLAN AND AGREEING TO PUTTING THE  RESOURCES INTO  IT. WHEN THE CRISIS  IS OVER, WE WOULD RESUME 2HOUR  SER. THE ANSWER TO  YOUR QUESTION IS  WHEN THE CRISIS  IS OVER AND THAT  WILL DETERMINED  BY OUR  INDICATORS, THAT  WILL BE  DETERMINED BY  WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DISEASE. LOOK, MY GENERAL  HOPE IS THAT  WE\'RE GOING TO  SEE MORE AND MORE NORMALCY FOR THE  NEXT FEW MONTHS,  WITH PARTICULARLY THIS AGGRESSIVE  TEST AND TRACE  APPROACH, AND  THAT IT WILL GET  BETTER WITH EACH  MONTH. AND WHEN WE GET  TO SEPTEMBER,  PARTICULARLY AT  THE BEGINNING OF  SCHOOL, I WANT  THE BEGINNING OF  SCHOOL TO HAPPEN  FULLY AND SAFELY  AND THAT IS ONE  OF THOSE THINGS I THINK WILL SIGNAL THAT NEW YORK  CITY IS BACK IN A REALLY STRONG  WAY. I WANT TO GET US  THERE AGAIN, THE  MODERATION  APPROACH TO GET  US THERE. SO I\'M NOT GOING  TO BE SURPRISED  IF THE OVERNIGHT  CLEANING GOES ON  FOR MONTHS  BECAUSE THE  HEALTH DYNAMICS  REQUIRE IT. BUT MY HOPE IS  IT\'S A MATTER OF  MONTHS AND THEN  WE CAN GET BACK  TO THE 2HOUR  SER. ON THE QUESTION  OF POLICE  OFFICERS, I\'VE  HAD THIS  CONVERSATION WITH COMMISSIONER  SHEA. IT\'S ABSOLUTELY  ESSENTIAL THAT  OFFICERS WEAR  MASKS. THE IDEA IS, OF  COURSE, FOR THEIR ROLE THAT THEY  PLAY IN OUR  SOCIETY, EVERYONE LOOKS TO THEM FOR GUIDANCE. EVERYONE LOOKS TO THEM AS AN  EXAMPLE. WE WANT PEOPLE  WEARING MASKS  WHEN THEY\'RE  OUTSIDE AND  COMING IN CONTACT WITH PEOPLE. LOOK, THE RULE IS CLEAR. IF YOU\'RE OUTSIDE AND YOU\'RE NOT  COMING IN CONTACT WITH ANYONE,  THAT\'S A  SITUATION WHERE  YOU ARE NOT  REQUIRED TO WEAR  A MASK. BUT I THINK IT\'S  SAFE TO SAY  POLICE OFFICERS  ARE IN CONTACT  WITH PEOPLE VERY  REGULARLY, AND SO THE NOTION OF  WEARING THE MASK  REGULARLY IS THE  RIGHT THING TO  DO. AND AGAIN, I AM  WATCHING REALLY  CLOSELY WHAT ARE  WE SEEING WITH  INTERACTIONS  OVERALL ACROSS  NOW TWO MONTHS. THE RULES HAVE  EVOLVED OVER TWO  MONTHS, BUT THE  REALITY OF  DEALING WITH A  CORONAVIRUS AND  THE POLICE ROLE  IN THE  CORONAVIRUS  CRISIS, OVER TWO  MONTHS WE\'VE SEEN VERY FEW  INCIDENTS. PEOPLE SAY, OH,  IT\'S GETTING  WARMER, BE  CAREFUL, BE  WORRIED ABOUT  THAT. I\'LL TELL YOU,  JEFF, FROM THE  VERY BEGINNING OF MY  ADMINISTRATION,  PEOPLE HAVE  WARNED ME ABOUT  THE WARMER MONTHS AND I THINK IT\'S  SOMETHING TO TAKE SERIOUSLY. I KNOW I TAKE IT  SERIOUSLY, BUT I  DON\'T WANT TO  OVERRATE IT  EITHER, BECAUSE  THE WORLD HAS  CHANGED IN A LOT  OF WAYS BEFORE  THIS PANDEMIC. THE REALITY OF  POLICING IN THE  CITY HAS CHANGED  PROFOUNDLY, THE  REALITY OF THE  CITY HAS CHANGED  PROFOUNDLY. THE SUMMERS ARE  NOT WHAT THEY  USED TO BE IN THE CITY. I REMEMBER WHEN  SUMMER WAS  EQUA WITH JUST VAST AMOUNTS OF  CRIME AND  VIOLENCE AND  TENSION BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES AND  TENSION BETWEEN  COMMUNITIES AND  POLICE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN  RECENT YEARS IN  THE CITY. AND THE PANDEMIC  CUTS BOTH WAYS. THERE\'S CHANGE  AND IT\'S CLEARLY  CREA A LOT OF  FRUSTRATION AND  CHALLENGES. IT\'S ALSO CHANGED PEOPLE\'S  LIFESTYLES  PROFOUNDLY AND  IT\'S CREA  UNITY AND  PURPOSEFULNESS  ABOUT LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER. A LOT FEWER  PEOPLE ON THE  STREET TO BE  POLICED. SO I DON\'T THINK  IT\'S A SIMPLE  EQUATION THAT  SAYS WE\'RE ONLY  GOING IN ONE  DIRECTION. I THINK WE HAVE  TO GIVE CLEAR  GUIDANCE IN OUR  OFFICERS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND  WE WILL DO THAT. BUT I THINK THE  VAST MAJORITY OF  INTERACTIONS  BETWEEN OUR  POLICE AND  COMMUYE P   EFFECTIVE AND I  HAVE FAITH THAT  WILL T TO  BE THE CASE. >> HELLO, MAYOR,  AND EVERYONE. I\'M JUST  WONDERING IF YOU  HAD A RESPONSE TO THE CONTROLLER\'S  REPORT YESTERDAY  ESTIMATING AS  MANY AS 900,000  PEOPLE COULD LOSE THEIR JOBS, AND  COULD I SEND IT  BACK TO GLORIA  FOR HERS? >> A GOOD  APPROACH, BUT I\'M NOT GOING TO GET  INTO IT TODAY. IF GLORIA HAD  SENT YOU THE  QUESTION, THAT\'S  GREAT. BUT WE\'RE NOT  GOING TO BRING  HER BACK ON THE  LINE. SO IF YOU HAVE A  SECOND QUESTION,  ASK IT NOW,  KATHLEEN. >> THAT\'S OKAY. THAT\'S WHAT I\'VE  GOT. IF YOU COULD JUST FOCUS ON THE  REPORT, I WOULD  GREATLY  APPRECIATE IT.  >> GREAT. SO KATHLEEN,  LOOK, IT\'S A  STAGGERING  NUMBER. THINK ABOUT THIS  IN HUMAN TERMS. THAT\'S SO MANY  FAMILIES THAT NOW ARE LEFT IN  DOUBLE FOR THEIR  FUTURE. THAT\'S SO MANY  PEOPLE WHO ARE  NOT GOING TO HAVE MONEY FOR THE  BASICS IN THEIR  LIVES. THAT\'S SO MUCH  PAIN THAT COMES  WITH THAT. WHEN YOU HEAR  THAT NUMBER, IT\'S JUST  UNBELIEVABLE. I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONTROLLER  DID THIS REPORT. IT IS SOBERING. LOOK, WE HAVE  BEEN PREPARING  FOR THIS REALITY  NOW FOR THE LAST  TWO MONTHS. IT\'S WHY JUST  EARLIER THIS  WEEK, I SAID WE  ARE NOW RAMPING  UP OUR FOOD  PROGRAM TO BE  ABLE TO FEED A  MILLION PEOPLE A  DAY. THINK ABOUT THAT, A MILLION MEALS A DAY. UNFORTUNATELY,  IT\'S A WHOLE NEW  REALITY. CERTAINLY THE  POINT ON THE  HUMAN SUFFERING  HAPPENING IN THIS CITY, BUT IT PUTS A PROFOUND POINT  ON WHY WE NEED  FEDERAL AID AND  QUICKLY. BECAUSE THE  SITUATION IS  GETTING WORSE ALL THE T AND  BECAUSEPLE  AFNG A BECAUHE  AIO THE  CITY TO REACH  PEOPLE IS GETTING STRAINED. WE\'RE GOING TO  USE EVERYTHING WE HAVE, BUT IT\'S  GETTING STRAINED  EVERY ADDITIONAL  TIME SOMEONE  LOSES THEIR JOB. IT\'S MORE AND  MORE NEED THAT  GETS CREA. SO I TAKE THAT  NUMBER VERY  SERIOUSLY. WE\'RE GOING TO  BUILD EVERYTHING  ON THE ASSUMPTION OF THAT NUMBER  AND IT COULD GET  WORSE. WE\'RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR EVERY  NEW YORKER. LIKE I SAID, THE  FOCUS WILL BE  HEALTH, SAFETY,  FOOD AND SHELTER. THAT\'S WHERE  WE\'RE GOING TO  KEEP OUR FOCUS,  WHATEVER THE  NUMBER OF  UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE BECOMES. BUT IF EVER  THERE\'S EVIDENCE  WHY THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENNES  EP   NOW. WE\'VE LITERALLY  NEVER SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE IT  IN THEIR  LIFETIMES, THIS  MANY PEOPLE  BECOMING  UNEMPLOYED THIS  QUICKLY. SO WE NEED A MUCH BIGGER RESPONSE  TO BE ABLE TO  PROTECT PEOPLE  GOING FORWARD. >> ANNA FROM  ""DAILY NEWS"" IS  UP NEXT. >> HEY,  MR. MAYOR, I LIKE YOUR HAIRCUT.  >> THANK YOU,  ANNA.  >> I JUST WAN  TO GET AN UPDATE. HOW MANY  CORONAVIRUS TESTS ARE BEING  CONDUC IN NEW  YORK CITY TODAY  ON AVERAGE? LAST WEEK WHEN I  CHECKED IT WAS  ABOUT 1,000 AND  WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS DAY. WHAT ARE WE AT? >> THEY\'RE AT THE SAME 13,000,  1,000 RANGE. THE LAST I  CHECKED, A DAY OR TWO AGO. WE WILL KEEP  UPDATING ON A  REGULAR BASIS. AND WE NEED A  BREAKTHROUGH,  MEANING WE NEED  THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TO  COME IN TO HELP  WITH LAB  CAPACITY. SO LET\'S SAY  WE\'RE AROUND  13,000. THE FACT IS WE  WOULD LIKE TO BE  INITIALLY, YOU  KNOW, TENS OF  THOUSANDS A DAY,  I WANT TO GET TO  30,000, 0,000,  50,000 A DAY AS  QUICKLY AS  POSSIBLE. WE WOULDO TO  GET HIGHER THAN  THAT. NOW, THE ANTIBODY TESTING IS COMING INTO PLAY NOW  MORE AND MORE AND THAT\'S CERTAINLY  HELPFUL. SO THE NUMBERS  WE\'RE TALKING  ABOUT, THE PCR  AND DIAGNOSTIC  TEST, WHICH STILL ARE THE SINGLE  MOST VALUABLE  TOOL WE HAVE IN  THE TEST AND  TRACE PROGRAM. BUT EVEN WITH THE IMPERFECTIONS OF  ANTIBODY TESTING, WE\'RE GOING TO  USE THAT  INFORMATION AND  IT\'S GOING TO  CONTRIBUTE TO  WHAT WE DO IN  TERMS OF TESTING, TRACING,  QUARANTINING AND  MAKING DECISIONS  ABOUT HOW  INDIVIDUALS CAN  ENGAGE THEIR  WORKPLACE OR NOT. IT\'S ANOTHER  PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE\'RE GOING TO  USE. WE\'VE OBVIOUSLY  STAR WITHOUT  HAVING ANY  TESTING AND WE  HAD TO BASE  THINGS ON  PEOPLE\'S  SYMPTOMS. THAT\'S ANOTHER  PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE CAN WORK WITH. BUT TO GET THESE  TEST NUMBERS UP  REALLY CLOSER TO  WHERE WE WANT TO  BE, WE\'VE GOT TO  GET A LOT MORE  LAB CAPACITY. WE NOW HAVE THE  SELFSWAB TEST  APPROACH WHICH IS EASIER AND  FASTER, BUT WE  NEED THE LAB  CAPACITY FOR  WHATEVER IT IS,  WE NEED THE LAB  CAPACITY TO  REALLY INCREASE  AND THAT\'S WHAT  WE\'RE WORKING ON  RIGHT NOW. SO I AM VERY  HOPEFUL IN THE  COMING DAYS WE\'LL PULL ALL OF THESE STRANDS TOGETHER  AND WE\'LL BE ABLE TO PUT UP REAL  NUMBERS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DO  THE TEST AND  TRACE WE NEED TO. BUT THERE\'S  DEFINITELY MORE  WORK TO DO ON THE LABS. >> HELLO, MAYOR,  HOW ARE YOU? >> I\'M DOING  GREAT.  >> TWO QUICK  QUESTIONS, THE  NEW OPEN STREETS  THAT YOU JUST  ANNOUNCED ARE  JUST ALMOST  ENTIRELY ALL OF  THEM BEING  OVERSEEN BY  BUSINESS GROUPS. AS YOU KNOW, THE  CITY\'S EFFORT TO  GET 100 MILES  WILL INVOLVE  COMMUNITY GROUPS  AND RESIDENTS TO  CREATE THE OPEN  SPACE UNDER  GUIDELINES ASKING FOR SERIOUS  COMMITMENTS IN  TERMS OF STAFFING AND MONITORING  THE SPACE. TODAY\'S  ANNOUNCEMENT,  THERE WAS A  POTENTIAL PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE ONLY  COMMUNITIES TO  GET THE VIETLY  IMPORTANT OPEN  STREETS PROGRAM  BE THOSE THAT  HAVE IMPROVEMENT  DISTRICTS OR  NEIGHBORHOOD  ASSOCIATIONS THAT HAPPEN TO HAVE  THE LUXURY OF NOT BEING PREOCCUPIED FOR MATTERS OF  LIFE AND DEATH  FOR ESSENTIAL  WORKERS IN THOSE  COMMUNITIES. AND THE FINAL  QUESTION IS I  NOTICE YOU  FINALLY DECIDED  TO INCLUDE  TRANSPORTATION AS ONE OF YOUR  RECOVERY PANELS,  SO I WAN TO  KNOW ABOUT THAT.  >> SURE. ON THE FIRST  POINT, GARTH, SO  NO, THIS IS THE  BEGINNING. WE EXPECT TO BE  IN EVERY KIND OF  COMMUNITY. IN FACT, YOU\'LL  REMEMBER THAT  WHEN THE IDEA  FIRST CAME UP,  THE CENTRAL  CONCERN WAS HOW  DO WE DO IT  SAFELY, WILL WE  HAVE THE RIGHT  KIND OF  ENFORCEMENT AND  STRUCTURES. AS WE HAVE BEEN  WORKING WITH THIS MODEL, WE\'RE  FINDING DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET IT  DONE THAT WE  BELIEVE ARE SAFE  AND COME WITH  STRUCTURE. SO I REALLY WANT  TO EMPHASIZE MY  CONCERN FROM THE  BEGINNING WAS  NEEDING  STRUCTURE,  NEEDING  ENFORCEMENT,  NEEDING SAFETY. AS WE\'RE GETTING  DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO IT, WE\'RE  FINDING MORE WAYS OF DOING THAT,  AND THAT\'S GREAT. WE ALSO SAID FROM THE BEGINNING  THIS HAD TO BE  SOMETHING THAT  FOCUSED ON WHERE  THE NEED WAS  GREATEST, WHERE  THIS KIND OF  APPROACH WOULD  BENEFIT THE MOST. AND WHEN WE  WORKED WITH THE  CITY COUNCIL ON  THE RECENT  PACKAGE, ONE OF  THE STRANDS WAS  FOCUS ON  COMMUNITIES THAT  HAVE BEEN HIT BY  THE DISEASE  HARDEST, ANOTHER  OF COURSE FOCUS  ON THE AREAS  AROUND PARKS, AND THEN PARKS THE  DEMAND WAS  GROWING WITH THE  WARMER WEATHER. SO THESE  EXAMPLES, THEY  ARE JUST THE  BEGINNING. YOU\'RE GOING TO  SEE THESE KIND OF OPEN STREETS IN  ALL FIVE BOROUGHS MORE AND MORE AND YOU\'RE GOING TO  SEE DIFFERENT  KINDS OF  ORGANIZATIONS TO  HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HELP MAKE THEM WORK AND GIVE  STRUCTURE JOINING INTO IT. WE\'LL ANNOUNCE  THEM AS THEY COME TOGETHER. IN TERMS OF THE  ADVISORY PANEL,  YOU RAISED A  COUPLE OF GOOD  POINTS AND SOME  OF YOUR  COLLEAGUES IN THE MEDIA DID, TOO,  ABOUT WHAT IT\'S  GOING TO MEAN FOR THE FUTURE TO  COME BACK  DIFFERENTLY IN  THIS CITY IN  TERMS OF ISSUES  OF  TRANSPORTATION. WHEN WE PUT  TOGETHER THE  PANELS, WE WERE  THINKING ABOUT  THE IMMEDIATE  RESTART ISSUES,  AND OBVIOUSLY  SOME OF THE  ISSUES AROUND  TRANSPORTATION  ARE GOING TO BE  DICTA BY  LARGER REALITIES  THAT ARE  DIFFERENT THAN  WHAT\'S HAPPENING, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH SMALL BUSINESS. A CERTAIN AMOUNT  OF OUR  TRANSPORTATION  SYSTEM  A LOT  OF OUR  TRANSPORTATION  SYSTEM HAS  CONTINUED  UNABA BECAUSE  IT HAD TO. SO IT\'S A  DIFFERENT  REALITY. IT\'S NOT THE  RESTART WE\'LL GO  THROUGH WITH  SMALL BUSINESS. BUT WE PUT THE  GROUP TOGETHER  BECAUSE EVEN  THOUGH IT\'S LESS  ABOUT THE  RESTART, IT\'S  VERY IMPORTANT TO WHAT HAPPENS IN  THE MONTHS  THEREAFTER. AND WE WANT TO  START PLANNING  NOW, AND AGAIN  SOME OF THE  QUESTIONS I WANT  TO THANK YOU, AND I WANT TO THANK  YOUR COLLEAGUES  WHO RAISED THIS  POINT ABOUT, IS  THIS AN  INFLECTION POINT, IS THIS A MOMENT  TO RETHINK HOW WE GET AWAY FROM TOO MUCH DEPENDENCE  ON CARS? AND THE ANSWER IS YES. WE NEED TO SEE  THIS AS A  TRANSFORMATIONAL  MOMENT, EVEN WITH ALL THE PAIN AND  EVEN WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES. WE ARE NOT GOING  TO BRING NEW YORK CITY BACK THE WAY IT WAS. WE\'RE GOING TO  BRING IT BACK IN  SOME WAYS THAT  ARE DIFFERENT AND BETTER. AND BECAUSE WE\'RE IN A  TRANSFORMATIONAL  MOMENT, WE CAN  RETHINK SOME  THINGS AND DO  THEM VERY  DIFFERENTLY. SO WHAT I WANT TO SEE FROM THIS  GROUP  AGAIN,  LESS ABOUT THE  IMMEDIATE RESTART DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE IN THE  COMING WEEKS,  MORE ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE  MONTHS AND YEARS  AHEAD. I WANT IDEAS ON  HOW WE MAXIMIZE  MASS TRANSIT,  MINIMIZE THE USE  OF THE  AUTOMOBILE, THINK ABOUT THIS IN  TERMS OF FIGHTING GLOBAL WARMING  AND POLLUTION AND THINK ABOUT THIS  IN TERMS OF  FIGHTING  CONGESTION. THINK IN IT IN  TERMS OF EQUITY  FOR COMMUNITIES  AND REALLY HELP  US TAKE A BIG  JUMP FORWARD BY  THE END OF THIS  ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE  APPROACH ISSUES  OF TRANSPORTATION WITH AN IDEA ON  THE FUTURE. >> JULIA FROM THE POST.  >> GOOD MORNING. TWO SEPARATE  QUESTIONS FOR  YOU, MR. MAYOR. ONE IS A  FOLLOWUP ON THE  FURLOUGHS AND  LAYOFFS. ARE YOU WILLING  TO SACRIFICE  FIRST RESPONDERS, TEACHERS AND  HEALTH CARE  WORKERS WITHOUT  FIRST MAKING  SPENDING CUTS  IDENTIFIED BY  CONTROLLER  STRAYER, PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT HAVE  PROVEN RESULTS  SUCH AS DRIVE NYC AND UNNECESSARY  CONTRACTS. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION IS A  FOLLOWUP TO WHAT YOU SAID ON TV  THIS MORNING  ABOUT NURSING  HOMES. YOU SAID THAT  SOME COVID  PATIENTS SHOULD  GO BACK TO THE  FACILITIES  BECAUSE THAT\'S  WHERE THEY\'RE  KNOWN. BUT HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE IF  THEY\'RE ALSO  EXPOSING OTHER  VULNERABLE  ELDERLY RESIDENTS TO THE DISEASE? SHOULDN\'T THERE  BE ALTERNATIVE  FACILITIES THEY  CAN GO TO HELP  PREVENT THE  SPREAD OF THE  VIRUS? >> JULIA, AS I\'VE TALKED TO OUR  HEALTH CARE  LEADERS, THERE  HAS BEEN A  RECOGNITION THAT  THIS IS A COMPLEX QUESTION. IT\'S NOT A SIMPLE QUESTION OF  SAYING THAT THE  BEST THINGS FOR  SENIORS ARE  ALWAYS TO SEND  THEM INTO A  HOSPITAL SETTING. WHAT I THINK I  WOULD SAY IS WE  NEED SOME REAL  SERIOUS CHANGES  IN THE APPROACH  TO NURSING HOMES. ALTHOUGH THE CITY DOESN\'T HAVE A  DIRECT ROLE IN  NURSING HOMES AND BECAUSE I DON\'T  EXPERIENCE THESE  ISSUES BECAUSE WE DON\'T REGULATE  THE NURSING  HOMES, WHAT I\'M  SEEING ON A HUMAN LEVEL IS  UNACCEPTABLE. AND OBVIOUSLY THE CITY HAS TRIED IN EVERY WAY WE CAN  TO HELP THE  NURSING HOMES IN  THE LAST TWO  MONTHS, TO GET  THEM PPE AND  PROVIDE WHATEVER  SUPPORT WE CAN. BUT I THINK THIS  CRISIS IS  POINTING OUT THAT WE NODE A  DIFFERENT  APPROACH GOING  FORWARD. A LOT OF THEM ARE FORPROFIT  ENTERPRISES. IF THAT MODEL IS  GOING TO BE  CONTINUED, IT\'S  OBVIOUSLY GOING  TO NEED MORE  RIGOROUS  STANDARDS GOING  FORWARD. BUT ON THE  SPECIFIC QUESTION OF WHERE SHOULD  THE SENIOR BE IF, GOD FOR BID, THEY CONTRACT COVID,  FIRST OF ALL, A  DOCTOR HAS TO  DECIDE THAT. SECOND OF ALL, I  DO UNDERSTAND  THAT YOU HAVE TO  THINK ABOUT THE  TOTALITY OF THAT  SENIOR\'S LIFE. AND FOR MANY  SENIORS IN  NURSING HOMES TO  BE AWAY FROM THAT PLACE COULD BE  PROBLEMATIC IN A  WHOLE HOST OF  OTHER WAYS. I THINK THE  QUESTION IS CAN  THE NURSING HOME  SUPPORT THAT  INDIVIDUAL WHILE  KEEPING EVERYONE  ELSE SAFE. IF THEY CAN,  THAT\'S A VIABLE  OPTION. IF THEY CAN\'T, OF COURSE THE SENIOR SHOULD NOT BE  THERE. BUT I THINK IT\'S  UP TO DOCTORS AND IT\'S ABOUT EACH  INDIVIDUAL CASE. ON THE SECOND  POINT, WE\'RE  GOING TO JUST  DISAGREE FROM THE BEGINNING,  RESPECTFULLY, AND I RESPECT THE  CONTROLLER, DON\'T AGREE WITH HIM ON SOME THINGS AS  WELL, AS TO WHICH INITIATIVES ARE  HAVING WHICH  IMPACT ON PEOPLE. ANYTHING THAT\'S  ABOUT HEALTH AND  SAFETY IS A  PRIORITY, WHETHER IT\'S PHYSICAL  HEALTH, MENTAL  HEALTH, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  HEALTH, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  SAFETY, WE\'RE  FOCUSED ON  SHELTER AND FOOD  RIGHT NOW. SO I\'M GOING TO  LOOK AT THE  ENTIRE BUDGET AND FOR THE DURATION  OF THIS CRIES I\'M GOING TO TAKE A  LOOK THROUGH THAT PRISM. I SAID EARLIER  I\'M NOT GOING TO  START PROJECTING  WHAT WE HAVE TO  DO IN TERMS OF  THE BUDGET. I\'M SAYING THAT  WE ARE MISSING  $7.5 BILLION NOW  AND THEN ADD THE  PROJECTIONS THAT  THE CONTROLLER  JUST GAVE US ON  UNEMPLOYMENT,  WHICH MEANS  HORRIBLE THINGS  FOR WORKING  PEOPLE AND  FAMILIES, BUT IT  ALSO MEANS LESS  AND LESS REVENUE  ON TOP OF THAT  FOR THE CITY. IF OUR REVENUE  PICTURE CONTINUES TO GET WORSE AND  WORSE, NOT JUST  FOR THE NEXT  FISCAL YEAR, BUT  FOR THE ONE AFTER THAT, TOO. AND IF THEY\'RE  THREATENED FROM  POTENTIAL CUTS  FROM THE STATE  LEVEL BECAUSE THE STATE HAS RUN OUT OF MONEY, WE\'RE  GOING TO HAVE TO  DO PAINFUL THINGS AND EVERY OPTION  WILL BE ON THE  TABLE. THE RIGHT WAY TO  DO IT, THE FAIR  WAY TO DO IT IS  FOR THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TO  STEP IN AND BAIL  OUT CITIES AND  STATES ALL OVER  THE COUNTRY IN  EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS  HURTING. EVERY PLACE  THAT\'S LOST  REVENUE, NOT ANY  FAULT OF THEIR  OWN, DESERVES TO  SEE THAT REVENUE  REPLACED. THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT CAN DO IT. I KEEP SAYING  THEY FOUND $58  BILLION  EFFORTLESSLY FOR  THE AIRLINE CITY, WHY ARE THEY NOT  HELPING CITIES  AND STATES GET  BACK ON THEIR  FEET. THAT\'S WHAT WE\'RE FIGHTING FOR AND  I THINK THERE\'S A GROUNDSWELL OF  SUPPORT,  INCLUDING FROM  REPUBLICAN  MAYORS. IF WE DON\'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN  WASHINGTON, ANY  AND ALL OPTIONS  WILL BE ON THE  TABLE.  >> MAYOR, I JUST  WAN TO ASK YOU TWO QUICK THINGS, IF I COULD,  PLEASE. I DIDN\'T QUITE  UNDERSTAND WHAT  YOU AND IF STEVE  BANKS WANTS TO  CLARIFY FOR YOU,  THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE  NUMBER OF  HOMELESS PEOPLE  ON THE SUBWAY  THIS MORNING AND  WHAT YOUR TALLY  IS, THE  DIFFERENCES   AND I THINK STEVE USED TO WORK  TRANSIENT, IF WE  WERE JUST ON THE  SUBWAY CATCHING A RIDE AND HANGING  OUT, THEY\'RE NOT  COUN IN YOUR  TALLY, AND WHAT  YOU\'RE SAYING IS  UPON INTERVIEWING THEM YOU  DETERMINE THEY  ARE LONGTERM  BASICALLY LIVING  ON THE SUBWAY. AND MY SECOND  QUESTION TO YOU,  MAYOR, I JUST  WAN TO GET  YOUR THOUGHTS ON  THE PRESIDENT  ANNOUNCING  YESTERDAY THAT  THE WHITE HOUSE  CORONAVIRUS   FORCE  GOING TO BE GOING AWAY  SOMETIME AROUND  MEMORIAL DAY. THAT SEEMS KIND  OF EARLY.  >> YEAH. TRUER WORDS AIN\'T NEVER BEEN SPOKE. IT SURE AS HELL  DOES SEEM KIND OF EARLY. I DON\'T  UNDERSTAND IT. MEMORIAL DAY IS  RIGHT AROUND THE  CORNER. I DO NOT  UNDERSTAND WH HE THINKING. I CHK THIS  MORNING AND MY  UNDERSTANDING IS  THAT THERE ARE  SEVERAL STATES  WHEREHE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING  MARKEDLY. THIS IS  WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE  WOODS BY ANY  STRETCH OF THE  IMAGINATION. SO THANK GOD  THINGS ARE  GETTING BETTER IN NEW YORK CITY,  BUT WE STI HAV A LONG WAY TO GO. THAT FEAR OF THE  BOOMERANG IS  SOMETHING  EVERYONE SHOULD  BE HAVING ON  THEIR MINDS UNTIL YOU ARE SURE THIS DISEASE HAS BEEN  FOUGHT BACK DOWN  TO THE POINT THAT WE CALL LOWLEVEL TRANSMISSION  WHERE THERE\'S SO  FEW CASES YOU CAN TRACE EVERY  SINGLE ONE AND  ALL THEIR  CONTACTS. UNTIL THAT POINT, NO ONE SHOULD  BREATHE EASY. AND THE NUMBER OF CASES AREN\'T  GOING DOWN. IF YOU\'VE GOT  PARTS OF THE  COUNTRY WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP, THAT\'S A  PROFOUND DANGER  AND IT WILL START TO SPREAD  ELSEWHERE. SO THIS IS FAR  FROM OVER. I DO NOT  UNDERSTAND WHAT  HE\'S THINKING. WE SHOULD TREAT  THIS AS THE  NATIONAL  EMERGENCY IT IS. THE PRES  NES   UNDERSTA   CORONAVIRUS I G AW  RIGHT AWAY, NO  MATTER HOW MUCH  HE WISHES IT WAS. HE NEEDS TO  UNDERSTAND THAT  THE THINGS WE  COULD DO TO  ACTUALLY FIGHT  THE CORONAVIRUS  WOULD BE TO GIVE  US TESTING AND HE STILL HASN\'T DONE IT.

94,0.0,"a pafully slow decle but it's better than the the numbers gog the other way you see it on total hospitalizations you see it on tubations  you see it also  the number  new cases per day this is important because while we're seeg that hospitalization rate go down  you see the number  new cases gog down those number  new cases are still problematic right so it means 600 new cases yesterday with everythg we've done we still have 600 new cases yesterday either walkg  the door to hospitals or people who are  hospitals who were then diagnosed with Kovac but that number is also gog down one  the most stubborn situations  the most distressg or the number  deaths  that is down from where we were but it's still 232 yesterday which is an unimagable  paful reality that we have to deal with  when people talk about how good thgs are gog  the decle  the progress that's all true it's also true that 232 people were lost yesterday  that's 232 families that are sufferg today also a caution  the number  deaths I know the reporters  everyone likes to trace these numbers  document these numbers I thk we're gog to fd when all is said  done that the numbers are much different than we actually thought they were the amount  formation that is now comg out that changes what we believed or what we were told happens almost on a daily basis this was a virus virus that started   now last week the CDC says oh it didn't come from  it actually came from Europe to the East Coast that's how it got to New York  that's how we got to Chicago etc that by the time we turned f travel from  the  travel ban the virus was already gone  it was  Europe  then it came here from Europe  we didn't know at the time so February March flights were lg people comg from Italy from the  etc they were brgg the virus we didn't know they're now sayg that the virus may not have come just  February March the virus may have come late last year they're dog testg  Chicago now on people who passed last November  December to see if they passed from the kovat virus so I thk this is all gog to change over time so a note  caution  I thk it's gog to be worse when the fal numbers are tallied we're also not fully documentg all the athome deaths that may be attributable to COBIT so I thk that the reality is gog to be actually worse but there's no doubt it's a time  unprecedented anxiety stress people want answers people want answers now haven't had a paycheck they don't know where their job is they don't know if they're gog back to work where they're gog back to work when they're gog back to work  they want answers now  I underst that fully but before we look for answers let's make sure we're all understg the same question right  the question here is not do we open or reopen the society when do we reopen it we have to reopen the society you know askg when do you start breathg you have to breathe right the economy must function people need comes the economy has to work state needs revenues people have to be able to live their lives you have to be able to get out  the house you have to be able to see friends you have to be able to see family so it's not a question  do we reopen it's a question  how we reopen that's really the question that we have to grapple with  that we're dealg with  New York our position  New York is the answer to the question how do we reopen is by followg facts  data as opposed to emotion  politics right everyone has emotion I want to go back to work today I'm gonna go see my family today I want to be able to go to a bar  have a couple  drks  socialize with my friends today I do by the way but it's not about emotion it's not about political position on reopeng there's no Democratic position an position this virus kills Democrats ans there's no politics to this deal with facts  deal with data  use that to struct you even more important at a time  high emotion underst the emotion appreciate the emotion but deal on the facts  the data  you have it you can calibrate by the number  hospitalizations the fection rate the number  deaths the percentage  hospital capacity the percentage that you're fdg an antibody test the percentage  fdg on diagnostic tests positive negative you're collectg tracg data make your decisions based on the formation  the data that's what we're sayg  New York that that actually works  by the way we know it works when you looked there's a chart today that was published by the New York Times you look at what's happeng  New York yes our our le is gog down our number  cases is gog down we have turned the corner  we're on the decle you take New York out  the national numbers the numbers for the rest  the nation are gog up they are gog up to me that vdicates what we're dog here  New York which says follow the science follow the data put the politics aside  the emotion aside what we're dog here shows results the hospitalization rate is down the number  deaths is down  the number  new case sce then for me I've been focusg on this number  new cases that's where our health pressionals are focused why because with everythg we've done close schools close busesses everybody shelter at home all the precautions about wear a mask wear gloves etc you still have 600 new cases that walked  the door yesterday week before that we still still saw one thous new cases every day where are those new cases still comg from because we've done everythg we can to close down how are you still generatg 600 new cases every day where are they comg from aga let's look at the facts let's look at the data let's underst  see what we can do so what we've done over the past few days is we ask hospitals look at just those new cases who are comg  right yesterday 600 new cases where are those people comg from  what can we learn from those people to further target  refe our strategy when you look at where they're comg from they're primarily comg from downstate New York which is not surprisg basically equally distributed Long Isl is is 18 percent so that's a number that jumps out at you Rockl  Westchester which is where we did have a problem that's down to 11 percent when you look at the racial breakdown  who's gettg hospitalized you see it's disproportionately morities disproportionately africanamerican  Lato aga  downstate New York higher percentage male 52 8 we don't know exactly why but the virus doesn't discrimate generally  a very high percentage comorbidities which is what we've been talkg about  which we underst which is not a surprise this is a surprise overwhelmgly the people were at home where there's been a lot  speculation about this a lot  people aga had a a lot  people have been argug where they come from  wherever we should be focusg but if you notice 18 percent  the people came from nursg homes less than 1% came from jail or prison 2 percent came from the homeless population 2 percent from other congregate facilities but 66 percent  the people were at home which is shockg to us disproportionately older but by the way older starts at 51 years old I'm a little sensitive on this pot but if older starts at 51 years old then that's a large number  us old folk  this  this state   this country so that whole vulnerable population beg old well old is now 51  up so thk about that 60 to 70 twenty percent seventy to eighty neteen percent but fiftyone years old is old okay  I am very old transportation method we thought maybe they were takg public transportation  we've taken special precautions on public transportation but actually no because these people were literally at home two percent took our services ne percent were drivg their own vehicle only four percent were takg public transportation two percent were walkg eighty four percent were at home literally were they workg no they were retired or they were unemployed only 17 percent workg so that says they're not workg they're not travelg the predomantly downstate predomantly mority predomantly older predomantly nonessential employees  that's important we were thkg that maybe we were gog to fire fd a higher percentage  essential employees who were gettg sick because they were gog to work that these may be nurses doctors transit workers that's not the case  they were predomantly at home so now that's only three days that's just about a hundred hospitals 1,000 people but it reforces what we've been sayg which is much  this comes down to what you do to protect yourself everythg is closed down government has done everythg it could Society has done everythg it could now it's up to you are you wearg the mask are you dog the h sanitizer if you have younger people who are visitg you  may be out there  maybe less diligent with the social distancg are you stayg away from older people oh they're startg at 51 by the way  but it comes down to personal behavior this is not a group that we can target with this formation it's really about personal behavior another issue that we're lookg at  we're tryg to underst  what is happeng  these hotspot clusters that you see poppg up you see it happeng across the country  meat plants where you have a significant number  people gettg fected  there's now a meat shortage  the nation well we have a hot spot  New York State we have a hot spot  upstate New York Madison allnighter counties  it's around an agricultural busess but it's not a meat processg plant it's actually a greenhouse farm  we have dozens  cases comg from the employees  this situation so what does that tell you well it's not really about meat or vegetables right there's nothg about the fact that it was a meat processg plant because we have a vegetable processg plant it is about worker density  large gathergs that's the caution flag here that's an the message it's not about poultry it's not about me it's not about vegetables it's when you run a facility with a large number  workers  advance environment  we learned that already  New York when we had the New Rochelle hotspot which was the first hotspot  the nation New Rochelle Westchester  the lesson was one or two people fected who go to a large gatherg or a dense gatherg that virus just takes f on you  we learned that  New Rochelle they're learng it aga  meat processg plants  poultry processg plants across the nation  we just went through it aga   we're gog through it now  Madison  Oneida County so that's somethg that we have to watch  keep  md also at the same time that we're gog through this reopeng exercise I want to make sure we don't miss the opportunity  the moment  the opportunity  the moment is that we went all through this let's learn the lessons  let's take this moment  history to actually improve from where we are  to build back better I want to set the bar high  set the goal  not just replacg what we did okay everybody go back to where we were I don't want to say that we spent all this time all this pa all this sufferg lost all these deaths only we'll go back to where we were go back to a better place how do you take how do you fd the silver lg  this viral storm  actually improve your situation we're on Long Isl we went through superstorm sy was horrendous thouss  people displaced but we learned  we built back better Long Isl is better for havg gone through Hurricane sy well how can you say that because it's a fact we learned we improved from a horrendous situation well how do we do that here  that's part  what we want to do you know people talk about makg changes  society change is very hard to make change is hard  your own personal life right how many new year solutions that we make as a society that are still  effect here  May right I was supposed to lose five pounds I was supposed to be runng every day I was supposed to never lose my temper forget it that one week maybe ten days for the temper the but history does show that people are ready for change at certa moments  I believe this is one  those moments like the superstorm sy like a 911 like we've seen after natural disasters around the country where people say I get it  I'm ready to make changes  that's what we want to do  that's what we talk about when we said look it's not just about reopeng it's about rebuildg it's literally about reimagg  movg the state forward at this moment  we want to do that how do we come up with a better transportation system how do we have more social equity  society a better safety system better housg better economy better education better health care system  we need the best mds available to take this moment to put together with the best thkg that we can fd to make the best improvement one  the lessons is  public health  our hospital system we worked  an impossible situation when this started we were told that we may need 130,000 hospital beds for kovat that was the itial projections we only have 50,000 hospital beds  the state how do you get 50,000 hospital beds to a 130,000 capacity it was impossible  by the way we don't really have a public health system we have separate hospitals all across the state but they don't really function as one system they never really work together on a day to day basis they don't share patient load they don't share PPE how do you do that  we scrambled  we made it work but now how do we stitutionalize that  how are we ready for the next kovat or the next whatever it is how do we use telemedice better how do we better you allocate our health resources how do we harden the healthcare system but let's take the lessons we just learned  stitutionalize it  we've asked Michael Dowlg to do that he was a big part  the Scramble that we went through to make it work  northwell was a leader it's the largest   my opion the most novative but now how do we take that  stitutionalize it so we don't have to go through this aga so next time somethg like this happens we can just open a book  it says here's what we do step a step B step C  we want to thank Michael for his service with that  he'll be workg with dr. Zucker from the Department  Health another area is education we went to remote learng overnight that's what happens when you close the schools okay all the students go home we're gonna go to remote learng what is remote learng  we weren't really ready for it we had all talked about it thought about it there was some but we were not really prepared to do it we then had to do it we implemented it  God bless the teachers  this state they did a phenomenal job  God bless parents who had to figure out quickly how to use computers  technology  zoom this  zoom that but how do we really learn those lessons  we went to Bill Gates  he's gog to work with us on reimagg the education system  I want to thank him very much how do you create a testg  tracg system by the way what is a testg  tracg system right we never did this before well we have to take thouss  kovat tests antibody tests diagnostic diagnostic tests  then we have to trace have an army  tracers to do this we're dog it for the first time ever but how do we learn  stitutionalize it yes we have to do this for Kovac but we're not gog to go through all  this trouble  then just forget it this will happen aga some people say this virus comes back  the fall or the wter or there'll be another health emergency but Michael  has generously said that he would work with us  use his philanthropy to develop that testg  tracg  then on a larger scale how do we really use new technology  the economy  tomorrow  that's the lesson that we're all learng right worked from home telemedice tell it's all about technology  a better use  technology  really corporatg the lessons to that  the probably the best md  this country if not  this on the globe to do this is I believe a true visionary especially  the field  technology  that's Eric Schmidt who was former CEO  Google obviously  just saw a future that no one else envisioned  then developed a way to get there  we've asked him to come work with us to brg that kd  visionary aspect to government  society let's look at what we just went through let's anticipate a future through that lens  tell us how we can corporate these lessons  mr. Schmidt who has tremendous dems on his talent  his time has agreed to help us  had an effort to do this Eric thank you so much for dog this  thank you so much for beg with us well thank you Thank You governor you have been dog an credible job for our state  frankly for the nation  I'm really pleased to help the first priorities  what we're tryg to do or focus on telehealth remote learng  broadb we can take this terrible disaster  accelerate all  those  ways that will make thgs much much better the solutions that we have to come up with have to help the people most  need people are  different situations throughout the state we need to consider all  them  not pick one or the other so the tent is to be very clusive  make this thg better we need to look for solutions that can be presented now  accelerated  use technology to make thgs better my own view is that these moments are a chance to revisit thgs that are not gettg enough attention  we have systems that need to be updatg  need to be reviewed my commitment is to make this period this sort  awful period to be a period as you described  Long Isl where New York State New York City everyone comes out stronger the publicprivate partnerships that are possible with the telligence  the New Yorkers is extraordary it needs to be unleashed you are the person to help us do that we are already where we're all  we are New Yorkers so we're aggressive about it  we're ambitious about it  I thk we get it Eric you know we went through this period  we realized that change is not only imment but it can actually be a friend I've done the right way  I hope that when we look back on this time we talk about all the pa or the sufferg but we also say it was a moment  time where we came together  we brought a creative aspect  an novative aspect  we work together  ways we never did before  we made this place a better place  I can't thank you enough for dog it Eric thank you very much I look forward to contug the conversation  workg together mr. Schmidt thank you yes thank you God thank you that is excitg last pot today is ional Nurses Day as you know nobody knows better than New Yorkers how our nurses really stepped up with our health care pressionals you know when the pressure is on  our lives you wd up seeg the best  the worst  people  heroes rise to the occasion  that's what we saw here  the state  New York our frontle health care workers were just extraordary showg up every day workg impossible hours a virus that nobody understood fear  fection but they just kept risg to the horizon to the occasion  that's why New York  the nation just loves all our healthcare workers but our nurses especially have done a phenomenal job  we thank them from the bottom  hearts  JetBlue had a beautiful idea  a way to say thank you which is donatg roundtrip flights to 100,000 medical personnel  nurses to honor their efforts isn't that a beautiful thg 10,000 to New York medical pressionals Michael darlg doesn't is not eligible for that situation but other than that because we need him here  New York but it's a nice way that JetBlue is sayg thank you  all  us will fd our own way to say thank you but I'm sure every New Yorker jos me  sayg thank you thank you thank you from the bottom  our heart  to all the nurses who are here today god bless you  thank you for gettg us through this  thank you for beg New York tough which is not just tough but smart  discipled  unified  lovg god bless you questions yes about reopeng so along the way you've rubberstamp some thgs that you could say make common sense like golf courses you know you asked about drive theaters you said hey that might be a good idea so if a busess owner right now says I have a super creative way to do this I can do it immediately  be safe you talk about smart New Yorkers telligent Yorkers do you trust that  you move forward with other thgs yeah piecemeal yeah we have we have a very detailed reopeng plan with very detailed steps I touch on it  what we just talked about we look at different regions  the state because there are different situations  different regions right New York City is different than Long Isl that's different than the Adirondacks is different than Buffalo New York  the numbers are just dramatically different the way we talk about  this nation states are  different places  this state regions are  different places that's how big this stadium is how diverse it is so there are specific factual data pots that each region has to assess our is your fection rate gog up or is it gog down or your house correlations gog up or your hospitalizations comg down do you have healthcare capacity if god forbid that fection rate takes f on you do you have the hospital capacity to deal with that do you have the ICU beds to deal with it you have the PPE if yes to those questions then  that region workg with the local ficials what busesses do we reopen  the analysis there is busesses that are most essential  pose the lowest risk should go first construction jobs because construction jobs especially exterior construction jobs workers are basically socially distanced by the nature  the work  can wear masks gettg their construction dustry up  runng aga manufacturg  a manufacturg settg where you can do social distancg right the meet plants are a caution flag the poultry plants are a caution flag the agriculture farm upstate is a caution flag not manufacturg where you have density  people three feet from each other on a factory le because that's a problem but manufacturg where you can socially distance  then you can even go busess by busess drive theater where an employer says this is how I'm gog to operate it everybody stays  a car nobody gets out  a car you can make those decisions a book stores you could say maybe a laundromat know is that we get to that pot  we have the steps where you go through the data because first  all you want to make sure you have the you want to make sure you have the virus on the retreat right you want to make sure you're not still seeg that virus like fire through dry grass  we do have the virus on retreat all across the state different levels  retreat  different parts  the state but it is on retreat  all parts  this state which is dramatically different than the numbers for the nation which is worth notg you have states that are openg where you still are  the cle I thk that's a mistake regarde the spike  a homeless population  New York City do you thk by cuttg the advantage program you bear some responsibility for New York City's spike homeless creased fundg for homeless all across the board local governments then decide what the best programs are for that locality it's different or not so different  Suffolk different  New York City but we've creased fundg dramatically exponentially  so it's not just a question  fundg it's how you use that fundg  I've worked on the homeless issue sce I was  my 20s first I ran a notforprit I was the largest notforprit provider for homeless families  the United States then I'm with the federal government I worked on homeless programs all across the country I've been  more homeless shelters homeless programs than probably any other elected ficial so it's it's not just money it's you have to know what you're dog  you have to have a program that makes sense [] look the best we can do you still have to run elections the court said we have to run elections I don't thk it's a good idea to have people go stg on le to vote you shouldn't say to a person if you want to exercise your civic duty you have to endanger your public health  possibly endanger others we've seen video  other elections held across the country we have people waitg on le six feet apart to vote I mean that that made no sense to me so to the extent we can do absentee ballots  make that available to everyone  mail them out to everyone  make that easy I thk that is the best way if we have to also have an election day with people show up on Election Day my two cents to people is please vote by absentee ballot so you don't have to show up but then if they have to show up they have to socially distance etcetera are you dog anythg to make sure that the boards  Elections around the state are able to hle what you are askg them to yeah well we're workg with all the local boards  Elections I've not heard from any Board  Election that says they can't send out the ballots we told them last week they have to we'll send out prestamped forms that people can just send right back  I haven't heard any issues from any local boards  Elections have you heard we're workg closely with the local County Board  Elections as well as the heads  the Democratic  an Party to make sure everyone has confidence  how the elections are beg held there's a very real possibility that certa elections won't be called on election night that is a reality people should prepare for because as you said the hope is the majority  the people are gog to be mailg  their absentee ballot  so we want to make sure that the countg process is done right  it's thorough  that people contue to have confidence  faith  democracy  so that may mean that certa elections are called a couple  days afterwards to make sure the counts are done properly  terms  helpg to support the county boards  Elections one  the thgs we've discussed ternally if it's somethg that they need is supplementg with the ional Guard  seeg if the ional Guard can step   help where we know that they meant that there may be issues but it is somethg that we're focused on  contug to talk to the county boards but on a consistent basis tell me what happens with the pemic between now  November or not answer the question could you do you have any understg  whether people can be refected the east coast  West Coast or even or even  our region  whether the antibody test is any dication  the person's okay you're not beyond my paygrade on formation so I'm gog to refer the question to dr. Zurcher but just for what I know  what I believe I said the origally we were told the virus came from  right  everythg was stopped the virus from    travel ban CDC comes out last week  says oh no it didn't come from  it came it went from  to Europe  then from Europe to New York which is a dramatically different situation because we were sittg here  New York February March watchg   the federal government came   they were all our airports screamg everybody from  nobody screamed people comg from Europe  now it turns out they were like two million people who came from Europe durg that time  they led at JFK they led it  Newark Airport someone to Chicago that's where the flights go  then they just mixed to society  then you have New York which is one  the most dense communities  the country  the virus took f nobody said it was comg from Europe right we people visitors from Europe work walked right through the airport nobody said two New Yorkers be careful if you just with somebody who came from Italy be careful they may have the virus nobody said that so it was totally new I can't speak to the East Coast stra versus the West Coast stra on the antibodies that was an itial thought that if you had gotten the virus  you had the antibodies that you would be immune to another fection I thk that's now beg questioned but aga you're beyond my paygrade Thank You governor so what the CDC is dog   others are lookg at is the genetic fgerprtg  this virus to try to figure out the differences between whether it's those came from   from Italy  unfortunately all the formation is not out yet about how this has whether it's mutated what's the difference  these viruses  the severity  the virus as to whether a one stra would be worse than another regardg the antibody issue as the government said itially the feelg was that one has an Tobias a should be protected but we contue to learn more about this virus every day  that's one  the thgs we're gog to learn more about is the protection from when you have antibodies  what that means  also for how long that protection would last if one is protected from that so it is a great question it's hard to give you an answer at this pot right now because there's still more research to do today someone from Illois did they thk the virus may have come last December or November so they're lookg at autopsy reports to see if it should have been a cause  death last year which to me is just a wakeup call that you know we thk we know what we know but nobody knows nobody knows I mean look at all the revisions that are now gog on about all the facts that we thought we knew January February March all the necessary criteria even lg behd the city on one key data pot why is that  along with that the contact tracg seems to be a big challenge  yesterday  as you said that there's gog to be this stware for the contact tracg system isn't givg onle for four weeks what role does that play  the one  the new systems that we have to develop here is everybody talks about test trace isolate we have to do thouss  tests by the way we've already done 1 million tests  this state this state is brought testg onle faster than any state  the country  we now do more tests per capita than any country on the globe  New York so we've been very aggressive  successful at brgg testg onle but we have to have testg  every region Long Isl New York City upstate different regions upstate  then an army  tracers you're talkg about thouss  tracers who take every positive call up every positive who did you go to dner with who did you whatever  then isolate those people  you have that facilities to isolate people who can't be isolated some people can't be isolated at home so that has to be  place  every region we are workg with regions to get that up  runng but you have to have you have to have the virus on the decle  then you have to have a way to monitor that virus  that's testg  tracg I don't know about the counties stware system I don't know Jim we spoke I spoke to the county executive last night  that is one issue that we're workg with the county on is the testg  tracg the other piece that I thk you refer to as the gross hospitalizations new people comg  the door which is a sort  concern  new fections the data that the governor mentioned today where are people comg from what are their demographic formation who are they will help isolate  target better for people  regions to say here's a hotspot zone to get that fection rate down so this will help Long Isl  other regions target better where the fections are comg from to lower that overall fection rate which will help  the reopeng process as we go forward  that's what Michael  is helpg us with puttg together this tracg testg program aga it's never been done before on this scale we have to do it now  then we actually want to keep it stitutionalized because I don't believe this is the last time that we're gog to go through this I thk this is part  the

Philippe is difficult enough but it's aggravated by the dearth  essential formation those two articles from the same newspaper  that renowned leftwg crazy newspaper     if this extension  the public health emergency signals one thg it is this we can't give up one bit on the one thg that we know that is workg  this fight social distancg so contue to stay at home unless it's necessary for you to go out  when you do go out please keep your distance from others  wear somethg to cover your face remember  the absence  either a vacce or proven therapeutics for Kovan 19 specifically our only cure is social distancg coverg our faces washg our hs with soap etc  we know by the way that the effort  millions  the state  you is workg we have made enormous strides folks unlike any American state let's keep it that way today we're announcg an additional 1513 positive test results for a statewide total  130 1890 however let's keep  md that the big number we report is a cumulative total which has been growg sce our first positive test was received back on March th  these more than twothirds  these dividuals more than 90,000 New Jerseyans have now exited the important twoweek cubation wdow overwhelmgly they have defeated Cove  19 as we look to the trend  new cases we contue to see the daily counts levelg even as more testg sites contue to come onle  I'll touch on that  a few moments the rate  positivity among those who are tested contues to decrease as well as we've heard consistently now I thk for the past couple  weeks from you Judy right the spread is slowg this is the map the map  New Jersey contues to show slowg rates  doublg  cases  this is a very good thg  stay on this if you could the two Orange counties Salem  Cumberl have each seen fatalities  they each have positive test results but the numbers are meangfully lower by example as  today Salem has 353 positive tests Bergen County has 16,000 520 so it has come to that part  the state more slowly it's migrated as we've said so while the orange is darker  the bottom two counties on the left  Salem  Cumberl the fact  the matter is the numbers are a lot slower  God willg they'll get to the lighter shades sooner but look at that more than 30 days is that whole swath  counties that we now see that that's what it's takg to at least double  that's very good news so we contue to directly switchg gears for a second we contue to directly  aggressively confront the challenges at our longterm care facilities as the number  positive cases  deaths connected to these facilities contues to grow  that is the number  fatalities from longterm care may I say this we've said it before we say consistently that our health care workers are literally heroic  I want to give a particular shout out to the health care workers  the workers generally who are gog   out  our longterm care facilities  have been dog this day   day out  I've said  the past a couple  times as a special place  hell reserved for whatever there's a special place  heaven reserved  particular for those health care workers who were dog the Lord's work literally as commissioner Percy Kelly  Attorney General Gerber gray wall said yesterday we are takg aggressive measures with state government to protect the residents  staff at these facilities but we also know we won't have all the answers   the midst  their efforts we will also need to look more broadly at this issue not just for the immediate days ahead which obviously is our priority but also for the months  the years to come to meet this challenge we are announcg today that we are brgg on a nationally experienced team  experts to take on three prcipal tasks first to provide immediate support to the great work  Judy  her team at the Department  Health specific to longterm care second to conduct a two to three week review to address immediate concerns related to protectg longterm care facility residents  staffs the folks I just referred to a mute ago as we look to restart our economy  third to make longterm systemic reform recommendations leadg this team will be Cdy Mann on the left a 30year expert  health policy  former deputy admistrator at the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama where she was also tasked by the way with implementg the Affordable Care Act  secondly Carol Raphael former chief executive ficer  president  the visitg nurse service  New York as well as the former board chair  AARP we know the long term Kerr issue has been among the biggest challenges both here  New Jersey  nationally if not frankly the biggest  this will be an clusive approach to solve this challenge that will make us a national model God willg switchg gears as  10:00 p.m. last eveng 5221 patients with kovat 19 were beg treated  our hospitals  as you can see this curve contues it's steady overall decle  as we see the number  hospitalizations across our healthcare systems regionally contues to also trend down that's North Central  South our field medical stations reported 36 patients last night while hospitalizations had a small crease the number  patients reported  either critical or tensive care checked up negligibly but it did tick up to 159 but that is rough down roughly 25 percent jutti from just three weeks ago better later use currently sts at 116  this number  thank God contues to decle there were 39 new hospitalizations yesterday that's up meangfully over the past couple  days but there were also 35 live patients discharged yesterday all  these numbers are potg us  the right direction  while they are positive they still mean that thouss  our fellow New Jerseyans are still  the hospital battlg Kovan 19 this is why I needed to extend the public health emergency we're seeg good signs without question but we cannot lull ourselves to thkg that all is well so let's keep focused on pushg these numbers down further that's means keepg up with social distancg wearg a face coverg when  public  dog all the other seemgly little thgs that can make a huge difference  path this is especially for you I get criticized by a fuel though most loved the phrase the word knucklehead to describe the folks who are noncompliant  dog silly thgs check the governor from West Virgia he's got a little bit more  a graphic assessment those folks a few folks are worried about our beg too graphic I thk we look like a Disney movie  comparison we need to keep workg with two thgs  md public health public health creates economic health  data determes dates public health creates economic health data determes dates  course notwithstg all  this progress we contue to lose precious members  our New Jersey family  even with this good news that we see from our health systems we cannot forget that there

testg a moment ago  as we all know  exp  an accessible network  testg sites is one  the critical markers for us as we get back on the road to restart  recovery the number  available testg sites across the state contues to grow as  this morng there are 122 up  down the state different sites 31 which are either publicly run or open to the general public can be located at our formation hub at kov 19 NJ gov slash testg  a top  those 31 there are 91 more privately operated testg sites available  your private primary care practitioner can tell you where to fd the one closest to you  the comg days we hope to be able to announce even more sites which will open soon make no mistake we are pushg as hard as we can to get the testg regime  place remember that's step 2  the six step plan on our road to recovery step one is to flatten  break the back  these curves step two is a broad scale rapid return testg regime we are pleased with the work we are makg through our partnerships with everyone from the federal government to Rutgers  with our private labs  everyone  between we are leavg no stone unturned  we are not leavg anythg on the table we will get this marker  place next I'm proud also to announce that we have now exceeded pad it's hard to believe thirty five million pieces  personal protective equipment or PPE distributed by the Office  Emergency Management from our central warehouse a le  busess that New Jersey was as a state was not  just over two months ago as with testg we have left no stone unturned  fdg the masks gloves shields  other PPE our frontle Public Health  Safety responders have needed to keep safe throughout this emergency specifically I want to give some shoutouts to Pattie Panero at the fice  emergency management who works under Pat  Wayne Jacobson at central purchasg who undertook much  the procurement  these items  to Chris Dempsey  the team at the Department  Treasury who vetted every vendor  another big shout out to New Jersey State Police Sergeant your colleague dan cunng who leads the logistics team trackg everythg that enters  leaves the warehouse more importantly we're not gog to stop we know that we have an immediate need we mentioned this the other day Judy  I were callg gowns the new ventilators right we have an immediate need for hospital gowns  we're dog all that we can to source these  through the multi state procurement Partnership that we announced on Sunday we are confident that we will not only be able to deliver the PPE  supplies we need but that we'll be able to do so at a lower cost to taxpayers gettg PPE has  a race agast time   some cases it's also been erased agast our neighborg states no more now we're workg together to not just meet our collective needs for today but to ensure our entire region is better prepared for tomorrow fally this is somethg not related at koban 19:00 but frankly directly it is but it is  critical importance to our state  that is the census right now New Jersey is rankg 21st  all 50 states plus Washgton DC  Puerto Rico  terms  our response rate to the 2020 census well that's better than some  our neighbors it's simply not good enough we're at only fifty eight pot six percent we need to get this number up get it up meangfully  get it up fast ensurg every New Jerseyan is properly  accurately counted  the 2020 census is credibly important the census by the way is more than just a population count it is the data that the federal government  quite frankly we  state government rely upon to make decisions that impact every community  New Jersey we know that New Jersey was under counted  2010  because  that we have left over the course  the past decade  even today untold billions  dollars  federal aid on the table  if that money isn't comg to New Jersey it's gog to some other state like Kentucky let's make sure we get the darn money here so if you have not taken the time yet to be counted please take a moment go onle to 2020 census gov  make sure that you are counted so much rides on an accurate  full count before I h thgs over to Judy I want to take a moment as I do every day to recognize some  the New Jerseyans who are really dog some good thgs durg these unprecedented times you've shared a lot  their stories with us on social media by usg the hashtag  Jay thanks you  I ask you to please keep it up as we get closer  closer to our

we will do this  we will emerge as one extraordary New Jersey family stronger than ever before please help me welcome the woman who needs no troduction the Commissioner  the Department  Health Judy purser killg Thank You governor good afternoon well as the governor announced manat health will be workg with us on a very tight time frame to complete a review  the state's longterm care facilities the review will look at what additional protocols resources  equipment should be put  place to best protect our residents they will compare New Jersey's oversight  these facilities to other states  exame differences  outcomes they will make recommendations on potential state or federal action to improve quality safety resilience  fundg with New Jersey's longterm care system we look forward to workg to buildg on these efforts with this team  experts who have more than 30 years experience  federal  state health policy these recommendations will guide how longterm care facilities can  the future safely care for their residents  the wellbeg  their staff they'll look at outbreak protocols they'll address mitigation protection  resiliency agast future outbreaks the Department  Health will contue implementg protocols spections  testg at all longterm care facilities while this review takes place so we are receivg lots  questions about the allocation  personal protective equipment or PPE specifically the supplies to our nursg homes here is what we did back  March the department worked with the New Jersey Hospital Association  the State Police to create a centralized ventory system that that was set up around March 2th at the New Jersey State Police Headquarters at the Regional Operations Intelligence Center the rock on March 28th the governor signed an executive order requirg all health care facilities to report daily their data concerng not only their capacity but also their supplies to the Office  Emergency Management the PPE distribution system was origally set up for hospitals but on April 6 based on reports we were gettg longterm care facilities began reportg their PPE needs to the portal remember the supply cha contracted nationwide  there were hospitals with less than three to fiveday supplies at the peak at the peak  Cove  neteen so all forms  PPE were  short supply  the state aggressively stepped  to purchase PPE to bolster the supply cha so we recognize that even today there are still challenges particularly for smaller facilities like long term care  that's why the state contues to use its purchasg power as part  a jot multistate agreement to develop a regional supply cha for personal protective equipment other than medical equipment  testg similarly testg resources had also been  short supply until last Thursday when governor Murphy  I met with the president at the White House we needed  we contue to need test kits reagents swabs  PPE especially gowns there are ne million residents  our state we won't need to test every sgle person but there is no doubt that we need to greatly crease our testg as a key to reopeng the state this will be dependent on the resources that are available to us as I reported we've delivered about ten pot seven million pieces  PPE to longterm care facilities additionally we spected sixty facilities curtailed admissions at several homes sent Federal Veterans Admistration to staff are our veterans homes we've issued over eighteen guidances now we are testg every sgle resident  staff statewide this focus on these facilities will contue with three hundred  fifty eight  the longterm care facilities reportg similar to hospitals five percent are reportg an urgent shortage  face shields four percent are reportg a shortage  gowns 2% a report reportg a shortage  gloves 2%  95  1% surgical masks we will contue to work with them to source their needed PPE as the governor shared we're reportg 5221 hospitalizations  which 159 are  critical care  7% are on ventilators the governor reviewed the new case  death report to report it today's know  terms  deaths I will report the race  ethnicity white 52.6 black 19.3 hispanic 17.5 asian 5.3  other 5. basically unchanged there are 512 longterm care facilities  the state with kovat 19 cases there are now 23 thous 35 kovat 19 cases  longterm care facilities at the state veteran homes among a census  676 residents there have been 361 residents that tested positive for kovat 19  there have been a total  125 deaths unchanged from yesterday  at our state psychiatric hospitals were the census  1250 168 patients have tested positive  there have been 10 deaths aga unchanged sce last week accordg to lab data from this morng we've tested 256 thous dividuals 100  1000 tested positive for a positivity rate  39.55 so that concludes my daily report stay connected stay safe stay healthy  I thank you Judy thank you when you go over the the race  ethnicity it remded me I meant to say this yesterday your very close friend  New Jersey superstar rich Besser CEO  the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation wrote  by the way also a member  our restart  recovery commission as well as one  our rip senators on the Regional Council so he's wearg to say he's wearg multiple hats is an understatement he wrote an oped for USA Today which i thk is a must read for everybody  it's called on coronavirus we know who will pay the price when states reopen before they should  it goes right at the equities that you  I have been speakg about now for over a month  it pats a sad but accurate picture  the reality particularly across race  America  sadly we know we live with that  our state I was just respondg to a couple  urgent I missed positivity rate for today 39 yeah so this contues to  the right direction  as you  Christa would want us to remd folks that's a cumulative number so the spot number is gog to be evitably better  it's also still disproportionately overwhelmgly disproportionately persons  with symptoms right that will change over time as I said yesterday we would hope sometime  the next number  days don't hold me to a day or don't hold us to a day but I know I thk Judy will be  violent agreement with me here that we would hope to have both a testg protocol to very explicitly go through with you folks as well as on the heels  that at some pot sooner than later or contact tracg the protocols as well I'll just go back to the all  effort on longterm care I thk I could speak for Judy  myself we have no lesson objective this is not a New Jersey specific reality if you pick up a any newspaper about any state  America right now where this is hit it's crushg places we have no lesson objective not only to deal with the here  now as best we can but we want New Jersey to be a national model we want to be as good  get this as

as well so we'll stay on the same schedule we're not gog anywhere this is still you know we're makg a lot  progress but the fire still rages so you should assume we're gog to stay plus or mus with the same schedule we've been on aga I will hope to be able to get you over the comg days more formation on testg strategy contact tracg at a mimum other updates will contue Thursdays our unemployment data days both nationally   New Jersey I'm sure we'll be have somethg to say about that at least summarize where that sts  with that let's jump  afternoon governor saw real quick I underst that you said contact tracg an announcement will be forthcomg but just curious if the state has hired any contact tracers to date  just a couple  unemployment some people have received regular unemployment benefits who have received it excuse me who have received regular unemployment benefits have said they haven't received the $600 extended benefit they know they'll get at retroactive Lee but just some  these folks need it now  just curious that there's a reason why they aren't gettg them we know you're workg through the backlog but some people say they've been approved for benefits  they see the amounts that they're gog to be paid but they've been waitg weeks or longer for their money any idea what the delay is  those cases  just lastly what are people supposed to do after they get approved for unemployment benefits  then it later goes back down to show that they aren't approved or that their balance is zero  it says it's not payable  they're not able to get anybody on the phone to clarify  those situations on contact tracg nothg to report but bear with us we're gonna have somethg for you over the next number  days we want to get this right so we want to make sure you know this these are that's the testg  contact tracg or steps two  three  our road to recovery I know I speak for Judy here we want to make sure that we get this as right as we can it'll be a combation  technology  boots on the ground who's dog the hirg  how many boots to be determed my head I don't want to get out over my skis but is it  my rights a we may have the Commissioner  late workforce development here tomorrow I don't have a good answer for you Matt on I know that the $600 is comg I'm not sure what the lag time is if you don't have it yet between what we're givg you versus the federal plus up I'm not sure I I don't have a good answer for you you're approved but you don't have it yet what's the lag time there   I thk your third question is what what if you at one pot got registered  everythg went well then you fd out that you're not so if you could bear with me will either come to you fle or will have if you could have the patience till tomorrow we'll have Rob acero Angelo I thk with us tomorrow thank you for that Paul good afternoon first are there  your view are there any limits at all neither the duration or the extent  your powers under emergency declarations second how can New Jerseyans accept havg their economic freedom subject to the will  some  the out  state political operators on your recovery Commission such as Washgton antitrump activists near a tendon  why are they no representatives  small busesses on that panel  Shore busesses specifically  then Steve Sweeney suggested lettg other busesses open up under the same social distance guideles as Walmart Home Depot  other stores that plaque  welcome chief counsel any comment about the limits or duration  the executive power so there's two statutes that have been voked there's the disaster Control Act which gives the authority to declare a state  emergency  then there's the public health emergency declared under the emergency health Powers Act the public health emergency by statute expires every 30 days unless it's renewed  order for it to be renewed the facts givg rise to the public health emergency have to contue to exist the governor today signed the second renewal  the public health ennio for the second time renewg the public health emergency the duration  a state  emergency is dependent on the facts as that caused or created the emergency  clearly the facts that created the emergency based on the presentation today contue to exist you obviously didn't see that ben bernanke was on there was george w bush's president representative runng the federal reserve so we've got people from all spectrums both  New Jersey  around the country we've got at least three CEOs  big companies  New Jersey car  a former Charlie Lowry  Prudential Ken Frazier  Merck Denise Morris  formerly  Campbell's Soup so we're we want all perspectives Center for American Progress that'll really a lot  really good work on very data specific testg contact tracg not at all related to any  the politics that might enter to this from time to time we do have a small busess representative her name is literally I'm embarrassed to say this slippg my md I apologize  other busesses listen we're lookg at that we're lookg at that we've had I thk I mentioned this yesterday I had a really responsible reach out to me from a mayor   it was a private exchange so I don't want to give give give up identities here but it's a really wellthoughtout plea on for Ma  small busesses   aga that's somethg we want to get to there's no question about that but you you look at the progress we're makg that's because people are stayg home they're not gog out  that's the sort  still guidg prciple here  we you know we've started to slowly take the baby steps Judy  her team  Christa they're gonna give us that tell us what the health reality could what market what the market can bear  we started with state  county parks  golf  that's gone well the weather's turned agast us but it's gone well   this that not a central retail is on the list that we're lookg very carefully  closely at   so that's you know stay tuned we just want to get this I started f deliberately readg from     a couple  articles that said there are an enormous amount  unknowns associated with this we do know that social distancg to your pot your question is what probably the best weapon we've got I've said that time  time aga Judy said a time  time aga if we could do that responsibly you should assume that that's on the list  thgs we want to do thank you do you have somethg sir please I have to first for the colonel if you could give us an update on the numbers  sorry can you give us an update on numbers  law enforcement statewide who have tested positive for Cova 19  the numbers  those quaranted  secondly for you governor what is the progress on universal testg for mates  state prisons  correctional police ficers thank you back to you that number I do have it as  this morng 95 law enforcement statewide tested kovat positive which was a decrease  just over four percent  the last day  currently 396 law enforcement ficers are out quaranted thank you for that Jessica Gonzalez is the name that I was reachg for Paul on our Commission I apologized to Jessica if she's watchg I've had the honor  beg troduced by her so shame on me you should assume that what we would call Judy I thk fair to say vulnerable populations cludg our Corrections populations are gog to be high on the list when we go through the testg protocol it's already already happeng right so the Department  Corrections has a full plan for universal testg they've already started but you're gonna you'll hear more on that as part  the testg protocols but aga to give you a preview vulnerable populations our first priorities thank you for that sir you're good please three for you first could you tell us the number  or do you know the the number  children who have been tested  how many  those tests have come back positive Governor Cuomo has ordered excuse me he's orderg 3d prted nasal swabs to crease Coppa 19 testg capacity is this somethg that you  the state have considered I've Governor Cuomo ordered 3d prted nasal swabs to crease capacity is that somethg that the state is considered  then regardg migrant farm camps are there any updates on the safety guideles  how the entire migrant community will be tested for cov   the event  a outbreak  these foreign camps how will workers be quaranted  given medical service judi unless I'm lookg at fatalities not a number  kids tested we have no fatalities under the age  18  this state I do not know the number we've tested do you all know the number  kids have been tested Christa yeah unfortunately I didn't brg it today either but we do remd people that if you are lookg for the specific demographic descriptive stuff you can always go to our website we have a daily report cumulative  our cases we have the breakdown  the ages we have the breakdown  gender  so you know we ask you to refer to that or others we can get that later yeah me you could follow up if you could with Christa I'm we're lookg at everythg on testg nasal swabs saliva the whole shoot match I don't have any specific on 3d prted ones but I'm sure that we if we do we'll have we'll have that as part  our testg news Judy's talked about the the the seasonal agricultural workforce as a is a big focus I mentioned that sgapura thought they had this whole thg beaten to zero  they've had a flareup because  this very same reality that we have  terms  the warmer weather where we've got folks comg  to help our farms up  down the state especially  the south  that's a it's gog to be another one  those communities that we're gonna have a particular attention to do you want to add anythg as specific to that journey sure we have a task force with or I should say a committee with agriculture  labor that has been meetg regularly  we have a full plan for seasonal workers we know that there have been several that have tested positive down south  that Salem Hospital is helpg with that  the FQHCs from the south are ready to set up tents up camps  we're workg with the growers the farmers I'll be on a call with them at begng  next week to set up the whole system for testg aga look for that to be a part  our discussion  the number  days ahead on testg let's go to a lease good afternoon Elise good afternoon on nursg homes what's the progress on the reexamation  causes  death do you know about how many fatalities now have been classified as coronavirus related upon that reexamation thank you thank you for that Judy or Christa aga this is a work  progress you know we know we get the number the questions on deaths particularly  longterm term care facilities very routely  you know we have various ways that we're lookg at the different death numbers  you know we get formation that it is reported to us from the longterm care facilities which is a little bit different than the actual numbers that we're lookg at from our laboratory confirmation reconciled with our death certificates so you know aga this is gog to be somethg that we're contuously hong  on Elise is a nonmedical certaly not an epidemiologist as Christa is this is a workg this is this will be I thk iterative  a work  progress I suspect not just  New Jersey there's gog to be a constant review three steps forward one step back reality  terms  cause  death among other realities thank you Dave good afternoon hi governor could you guys give us a little more  an explanation  we're regardg this expert panel that's gonna look at the longterm care situation how long are they gog to be workg when do you thk we might see some recommendations from them how is this gog to play out how quickly do you thk we could enact this stuff governor we've received some formation that people  livg  buildgs either apartment buildgs or condomiums they have elevators there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to whether you get  the elevator with somebody else especially if it's a small elevator whether you wear a mask or not some  these condo associations don't have any guidance about this what would your recommendations be how should people hle this  lastly here you've been talkg for many many days but  particular recently about the importance  wearg a mask we know  we've seen all  us that we see knuckleheads yahoos wise guys slime dogs for whatever reason don't seem to be wearg a mask numbskulls numbskulls  that group as well somethg else  West Virgia I'm told but okay so could you remd everybody  perhaps the Commissioner who needs no troduction would also be good here why is this important to wear a mask I mean what are we accomplishg  what do we not accomplish if we don't wear a mask  would you governor recommend that people should say somethg to somebody like I saw he appeared to be a wise guy  a supermarket was not wearg a mask do I confront him do I ask him politely should I be afraid I know the colonel is armed he would not have a quite a problem makg a comment but for those  us that are not what do we do I thought that last one you mean when I call the colonel  come   help you may I say a couple  thgs  then I thk it sounds like there's an ample opportunity both for you Judy  you Pat to weigh  here it's not an expert panel this is a this is a these are people who have a busess that are gog to come  hired by us as a state by Judy ourselves to actually do the three thgs that we talked about the near term  the  the long term steps  Judy can give more color than that so this is not unlike the Commission which we're gog to for advice these are folks who are gog to come  roll up their sleeves  help us I don't know that we've got elevator protocol I know that  our fices you have to wear  that's it our capacity limits is to per elevator I do we have a statewide elevator protocol Matt to the best  your knowledge we don't have a elevator specific protocol but we have various protocols for different types  buildgs yeah what's what's what's give that some thought it's a very good pot my pride to hang my hat on somethg I'd say to max must wear a face coverg to Matt unless you're  a family group right well let's allow us to come back to that listen Judy  Christa could tell you why we wear face covergs   the the health bona fides around it are unimpeachable so that's it's quite clear why we do it I'll let them say it I personally am  a strong opion that there's sort  at least three very basic thgs we could do stay away from each other cover our face wash our hs with soap  water regularly I thk if we all did that we would be  I thk a lot  folks are dog that right now  have been dog it those are really basic but really smart thgs to do  aga I'm by wearg this  that's why I don't want to get any closer to you um it's for your benefit not for me right so I'm so I'm not spewg droplets on you with six feet  so we we take these f only to speak at these press conferences I don't want to get you  harm's way so first  all let me just say this that  a supermarket right now they have to be wearg the mask that has to be enforced by the operator  it's up to you but I would tell somebody that's not optional  an elevator FairPot we don't have I don't thk we've got guidance when I was  the Thompson Park  Monmouth County this weekend folks along the path for the most part we're not wearg masks I wish they were we were not matg it we were recommendg it I'm  the category that I thk we should be stronger on that but there are also compliant there's then there's massive compliance challenges that make life for guys like pat even more almost unreasonably complicated any comments to either  the two folks to my right on masks  particular Christa as the governor mentioned yes the ma importance  the mask is to protect others from you but you know it's a secondary note sometimes the mask is a nice remder for us that don't touch your face I thk because remember contamation your hs might be dirty if you accidentally touch your face you could potentially troduce virus to you know your mouth or your nose whether it's a corona virus or another respiratory virus so primary primary protection is for others but for yourself just a remder don't touch your face judi anythg you want to add on the on the folks we're brgg  there they're there  to help us work right oh yeah  they I was on the phone with Cdy man last eveng  aga this morng  they're gonna hit the ground runng to look at not only what we're dog here  New Jersey they have national presence they've been workg  a number  hotspots so we're gonna start comparg is there more that we should be dog  how do we implement certa protocols  what they would recommend so I look forward to any put that they can give us you know the residents  the longterm care facilities deserve it heroic workers who go there every day right aga just to repeat three so three prongs one is immediate support on longterm care two is to do a very fast you know measured  two or three weeks review  where we are  then thirdly to give Judy  me  any any  us volved  this a recommendation sort  what this needs to look like is a longterm structural matter so thank you for that John you get to brg us out here today thanks it's the state collectg data from county jails on testg  deaths anythg from essex on its antibody testg program  are you gettg details about ice to take anythg from essex essex Essex has an body testg program  are you gettg any ice detaed details about ice detaee testg governor you've been very vocal about other government agencies holdg public meetgs they shouldn't be the holdg  virtually last night  Sussex County the Montague Board  Education held another person public meetg its second any comment on that any idea if the departed  Education signed f on that meetg  I have a couple questions about the task force you formed  January can you tell us what it's been dog sce January anythg specific it's that for example did it did they suggest any eoz you've signed can you tell us the people you've you've talked to the experts anythg that's gog on is it still meetg what's happeng behd the scenes with that task force we've been tryg to get some details on what it's dog  do you see it contug for a while how is it tegratg with these other commissions  task force reportg together let me start with the public meetg the people should not be meetg right now so mad am i right sayg if you've got under ten what's the what's the the ten or under ten magic here I want to make sure I don't like my own executive order you your b on gathergs is still  effect there's the Colonel's issued an admistrative order that says gathergs under ten are presumptively  compliance with with your executive order but we're not encouragg them I don't know how many people are  the room but if they're more than 10 neither Judy or I nor Pat would be happy god I should say that if facts dicated that the evidence dicates even under 10 if there's that the gatherg shouldn't be happeng that there's still discretion at the whole I don't have the do you have the county jail formation Judy we tell can we come back to him that  that that cludes I thk you asked both about Essex  status  Essex County antibody tests county jails as well as ice detaees so can we come back to n on those md will you help me with that the task force so I would just say this  Judy should come  behd me as it she's the chair  the task force the task force was we started discussg sort  what this looked like as a leadership team  certaly most importantly  the Department  Health this beg coronavirus  January  I thk it was Super Bowl Sunday that I put pen to paper to establish it under Judy's leadership  I'd say  aga Judy will come   correct  amplify the record here  the first number  weeks this was like a lot  task force's wholegovernment figurg out where we thought this was gog to come at us what sort  a response we needed to have  buy some time I'm Judy I'm gog to say late February early March certaly by March th we had our first case it's now allout war so it's it's not it's a task force  the sense that it's the entirety almost it's every moment  every day  all  our lives so it's it's it's the reality  almost all  what we're dog  government right now as opposed to we're gog to have a task force meetg at 2 o'clock on Tuesdays it's allconsumg it's it's clearly under Judy's leadership it's the war room at the at the rock it's the varieties jared maples it's Carol Johnson  Human Services it's the entirety our our team  the front fice so I don't want to say it doesn't exist but but it's  fact it's morphed to every almost everythg we're dog right now the task force has met weekly sce February 3rd when the governor convened  the workers has generated from well how do we protect the people  each department meang the people they care for people  group homes how do we keep up the WIC program how do we make sure that nutrition occur I mean that when I thk it seems like we've been workg on this for years  it's only been sce February 3rd we're now meetg  sharg  fact I thk we have a meetg today the algorithm for 10  makg sure that all  the group homes that were responsible for the populations that each  every department is responsible for whether it be transit or Children  Families Human Services that we identified vulnerable populations  make sure that the testg algorithm covers end to end from identification  the population all the way to isolation  quarante for those that don't have a place to go so it's that's what we're workg on now  it's it's been weekly journey  you mentioned teraction with the Commission just so our first Commission meetg Judy was on Monday on our side other than led obviously by dr. Shirley Tilghman  Ken Frazier on our side it was me Judy Tim Sullivan talkg about the economic impact  Liz Moyo talkg about the impact on our budget so they're all members   that's that was the tangible example  the teraction I cut you f earlier I should have backed to Dave's question before we break here any other advice you're  a supermarket you see somebody not wearg a mask what do we do I thk you nailed it go I thk the the most prudent thg is to let the store management or operator know I don't you know we don't want to see physical  verbal altercations at supermarkets I thk to the governor's pot that's what I would do  if I can just add to John's question about the task force that the Commissioner chairs right out  the gate we lead the cident comm structure over that which is the planng logistics operations as well as the fiscal / admistrative support so we're guided by those four basically pillars  cident comm  that's under as the governor said under commissioner Percy Kelley's oversight thanks cuff you so I'm gonna mask up here as we as we exit stage left aga tomorrow we are here unless you hear otherwise at 1:00 p.m.   Friday assume as well at 1:00 p.m.  Saturday at 1:00 p.m. aga folks thank you for everythg you're dog keep dog what you're dog aga I have to repeat this it's makg a huge difference   particular a huge kudos for the state  County Park  golf protocols that you all observe because it was overwhelmgly really good  that's gog to allow us to move the ball if we keep that up that allows us to move the ball down the field on thgs like what's the beach scene gog to look like what's that nonessential retail reality gog to be what's construction gog to look like what's elective surgery look like etc those are all decisions that we have to chop through aga you'll hear  the next number  days  I'm don't hold me to how many a very comprehensive discussion  testg gog forward  I thk on the heels  that at some pot sooner than later a similar discussion as it relates to contact tracg thank you all I want to thank the Commissioner purser Kelly dr. tan Colonel Callahan director Maples counselor Plotk the rest  you god bless you all stay safe see you tomorrow you"
100,0.0,"ENRIQUE CABALLERO: In the\nUnited States, it is estimated that there\'s\nabout 100 million people with diabetes  prediabetes 100 million people\n the country affected by\na blood sugar problem. KELLY CLOSE:  economic impact\n diabetes is devastatg. We spent almost $350 billion on diabetes  the\nUnited States last year. NARRATOR: Diabetes\na chronic disease that\'s notoriously\ndifficult to control. It can maim  even kill. A generation ago, less than three percent\n Americans had diabetes. Today, it\'s almost ten percent. It is now predicted that half  the U.S. population will have either diabetes\nor prediabetes by the year 2025. Half! NARRATOR:\nLivg with diabetes today is a story  new discoveries about our food environments\n choices. As a sevenyearold comg\nfrom a Third country  gettg free cy,\nI was, like, ""Yo, I\'m so down\nfor America right now. Like, this is tight."" NARRATOR: It builds\non excitg new progress  drugs  technologies that have made the disease\nmore manageable. This device\nis around the corner,  that\'s really\nwhat we\'re tryg to do, is get much better therapy\nto people that requires much less\n their participation  provides much better care. NARRATOR: And it reveals\nthe terrible struggles that so many with diabetes\nstill have, day   day out. So, they was lookg at me,\nlike, ""How are you even stg here\non your feet? You\'re supposed to be\n a coma."" CLOSE: So when we thk\nabout the impact to the system way too many\nemergencyroom visits, way too many amputations why isn\'t there\na war on diabetes? ♪ ♪ (siren blarg) WOMAN: She got her flu shot\nalready. So, this guy, I was just told...\nno, then he\'s fe, okay. We\'re good. Okay, let\'s put Goodall\n a room  I\'ll have my nurse\npractitioner start with him. Thank you.\nWOMAN: That\'s good. DEAN SCHILLINGER:\nI\'m Dean Schillger. I\'m a primary care doctor at San Francisco\nGeneral Hospital. One mute, okay?\nWOMAN: Okay. SCHILLINGER: When I started out\nas a young doctor, about one  20  my patients\nhad type 2 diabetes. Now it\'s one  two. NARRATOR: Diabetes undercuts one\n the most basic functions  our bodies our ability to break food down\nto nutrients, cludg the sugar glucose\nthat provides energy.  Okay. NARRATOR:  hormone that\nmanages sugar levels is sul. ♪ ♪ So, thk  sul\nas the medice that you can\'t live without,\nright? Like a key that unlocks\nthe door to your cells  allows the glucose\nto enter your cells. That keeps the level  sugar\n your blood  check  your cells nourished. NARRATOR:\nThis sulglucose cycle is disrupted  diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system\nattacks  destroys the part  the pancreas\nthat makes sul. In type 2, the pancreas makes\ntoo little sul,  the body resists\nthe sul it has. CLOSE:\nIt\'s really obvious when your blood glucose\nis too low, why that\'s dangerous. You know, you can\'t breathe,\nyou can\'t survive. Um, you won\'t live very long if you have blood sugar\nthat\'s too low. Blood sugar that\'s too high\nis equally dangerous, if not more dangerous over time. Diabetes is \na silent disease. It could take up to 15 years for someone with diabetes\nto develop the first symptoms that are related\nto high bloodsugar levels. You don\'t have a water  soap,\nyou want to use an alcohol pad. NARRATOR: For many people, by\nthe time diabetes is diagnosed, the damage is done damage that can clude\nbldness, heart disease, strokes, even amputations.\nNURSE: l right. re\'s not a lot  thgs\nmore disfigurg than, than losg a limb,\nparticularly a leg or a foot. We now have a limbsalvage unit at San Francisco\nGeneral Hospital to hle the volume\n these amputation patients, somethg ten years ago\nwould have been unheard . I\'ve probably seen maybe\na thous amputations. As far as these thgs go, it\'s healed really well.\n Yeah.  And it looks good. NARRATOR:\nDr. Schillger\'s next patient is a man with type 2 diabetes\nwho may be facg amputation.  Monteil Lee?\n Yeah, hey, how you dog?  Good to see you. How long have you been\n the hospital this time?  I\'ve been here for a week.\n A week, okay.  Sce Monday, rather.\n Uhhuh. SCHILLINGER:\nMonteil Lee is a 36yearold man from the Fillmore District, used to be the sort  heart  soul\n AfricanAmerican culture ,  the Bay Area. And like many young men, really has had\nvery little to no contact with the health care system, doesn\'t go to doctors\nfor preventive care, or anythg, for that matter. ( playg on speakers) Kept livg his, his life\nas a young artist was dog, which is makg . (hiphop \nplayg on speakers) So, now I want to talk\nabout your diabetes. How old were you\nwhen they told you?  I was 28. But I was experiencg\nsome thgs with my body that I\'ve never experienced\n life before.  Mmhmm.\n I\'m gog to the bathroom over 30 times a day.\n Mmhmm.  And I\'m just, like,\n""Somethg\'s not right.""  You\'re peeg?\n But... yes. But I\'m very energetic. I\'m an onthego type  person,  I\'m startg\nto feel sluggish all these different days. And I felt myself\nleavg my body.  I see.  One  my couss\nrushed me to the hospital,  they checked my levels,  they was lookg at me,\nlike, ""How are you even stg here\non your feet? You\'re supposed to be\n a coma.""  Right.  I thought I was about to die. So, they told me\nthat I had diabetes. And, at that moment,\nmy life changed.  Mmhmm. Can we look at your foot?\n Yeah.  Will that be all right?\n Mmhmm. I got an fection\non the top  my toe.  Just out  nowhere?\n Yeah. (wces): Ooh.  Yeah, I can see that. You got a, still have\na little shallow ulcer there. And then it started on this side here?\nYup.  And, but they said\nyou might lose the toe?  Mmhmm. SCHILLINGER:\nPeople with diabetes, because they\'ve got\na lot  sugar on their sk, the fungus loves\nto hang out there it\'s moist, it\'s warm,\nit\'s sweet  they grow foot fungus,\nathlete\'s foot, but  a person with diabetes, it can be the portal\nto death, right? So, the athlete\'s foot begs\nto burrow  the sk  create cracks  the sk,  that\'s, like,\nthe perfect opportunity for more virulent bacteria,\ndangerous bacteria, to enter to the sk  beg to filtrate\nthe entirety  the foot. Okay, I thk\nyou got to start... I\'m not your doctor here, right,\nbut I\'m gog to tell you, you don\'t want to put\nany weight on it.  Yeah, I\'m fightg it.  Who\'s your regular doctor?  I don\'t have one. Uhhuh.  Okay. So, what I was gog to suggest is that I could take over\nas your doctor.  That would be great.\n l right.  (chuckles) I appreciate it.  No, I want to hear that\nyou\'ve not been on your foot for three weeks is\nwhat I want to hear next time.   best doctor\ndeserves the best patient.  Exactly.\n That\'s how it goes.  And I was gog to say that.  See, great mds\neven thk alike, too.  So, so we got,\nthat\'s the clic, like, your primary care doctor. I will become\nyour primary care doctor.  Okay.\n Okay, my friend.  Appreciate you.\n You, too, good luck.  Thanks a lot. ♪ ♪ SCHILLINGER:\nI talked to the surgeon,  we both felt it was kd \nlike a 50/50 proposition as to whether he was\ngog to lose his toe or not. It would really be dependent\non his behavior, his choices. Would he stay f the foot, like, completely f the foot? Would he elevate the foot\nhigher than his heart?

As the sul manufacturers\nexplaed to Congress, they set the list prices\nfor sul. But then pharmacy benefits\nmanagers negotiate rebates that are supposed\nto lower consumer costs. Despite the vestment\nthat we make  rebates, some patients, cludg those\nwith surance, end up payg list price\nor close to it at the pharmacy counter. As a manufacturer,\nNovo Nordisk has no control over what surance... what sured patients pay\nat the pharmacy counter. So despite this evercreasg\nrebates that we pay, patients don\'t get the full\nbenefits  those rebates at the pharmacy counter. This needs to change. Patients are rightfully angry\nabout risg outpocket costs for many medices, \nwe all have a responsibility to address a system that is\nclearly failg too many people.

People could get a little drop\n blood, put it on a little strip,  voilà, there is\nyour sugar level. This was a huge breakthrough. n the sul pumps,\nsoon after. People say, ""Well, why\ndo you need an sul pump? Can\'t you just take jections?"" Yes, but the pump\nallows you to release, like your body does,\na little bit every few mutes.

despair  the opioid crisis creases  gamblg the prevalence  pornography the spread  magical thkg the resurgence  hate groups the explosion  xenophobia  so on he exames these developments sees the rise  Donald Trump  his authoritarian populism as an outgrowth a natural exploitation  these trends  issues a passionate call to action to reverse this distegration while there's still time anyone familiar with Chris's extensive writg over the years won't be surprised by the sharpness  forcefulness  his critique the detail  broad scope  his reportg  the many scholarly references woven to the book for the first two decades or so  Chris's pressional life he reported overseas as a correspondent coverg conflicts  Central America the Middle East  the former Yugoslavia much  that period he spent with the New York Times  he was part  the team  times reporters who  2002 when the Pulitzer for explanatory reportg for their stories before  after the 9/11 attacks prilg the global terrorism Network  the

ordaed a mister  the Presbyterian Church four years ago he's also taught at Prceton  several other universities  conducts college credit courses  the New Jersey prison system plus he's written about a

revolt with cartoonist Joe Sacco which was a bestseller Chris has spoken here several times before  I'm sure we're  for a very spirited  provocative discussion so please jo me  welcomg  back thank you so I'm gonna speak for about a half hour  then we'll open it to questions for half hour that's the every book that I've written has a kd  template  for stance days  destruction days  revolt which I did with the great cartoonist Joe Sacco one  the fest journalists  America  if you have not read footnotes  Gaza which he spent six years on it's a masterpiece on the israelpaleste conflict I knew it was it was gonna be a rough one to go through  I got up actually got up Easter morng before everyone  my house was awake so that it would be still  quiet  that book just reduced me to tears that book was really modeled on let us now praise famous men the great work by James Agee  what are the photographs by Walker Evans this book my kd  model was Emile Durkheim's great study  suicide at the end  the 19th century  France where Dirk who was an amazg sociologist very much like w eb des bois where he would go out he didn't he didn't rema trapped  his particular academic Enclave but really went out  listened  terviewed that which is  course what made Dubois such remarkable  important presence  sociologists with the United States writg about africanamerican africanamerican communities  he came to the conclusion this is where we get the term anomie that societies that distegrate that's societies  decay communities  decay create diseases  despair that's not his term that's his idea pathologies that are expressed that that that that that rise up from failed states  those would be selfloathg a sense  a lack  selfworth alienation all as Durkheim says that comes when you no longer have faith or belief  the established order the established ideology  established stitutions    that that those kds  pathologies are expressed  very selfdestructive activities gamblg hate crimes sexual sadism which is what pornography is  although I went to the extreme  my book Empire  illusion I had written about the porn dustry but for this book I went to kk.com hopefully none  you know what it is I didn't know what it is derekjjensen had to tell me what it was they bought the old ional Guard Armory  San Francisco  run the largest BDSM operation  the world which is livestreamed look Torre it is tortured as clearly I mean women are waterboarded  stuff  then people will be people can stream   say what they want done to the women I mean just appallg but anyway I went to these classes for like which were held  the basement  the armory for Dahms domate dahm dahm what do they call them people who are domant people who like what do they call no they're not domatrix their their their their dweeby guys who dress  black  me sittg  the basement I was not dressed  black  I actually wrote the gamblg chapter out  the Trump Taj Mahal before I even knew Trump was even go to announce which was appropriate decay I mean there was mice all over the place the lights were burned out  people were shootg up  the elevators  most  the Taj Mahal was mothballed it gets a nice picture  what's gonna happen to the rest  the country if he remas  power  then I was with these white hate groups nights the altright proud boys which  course hate groups or product  a diseased society the 3% ORS I was actually at one pot at night around a bonfire with these guys  upstate New York  I  course livg  mortal fear that someone there would Google me  at a bathhouse with my research assistant who was terrified quite justifiably so  at one pot across the bonfire  the dusk we saw two or three  these guys potg at me that's when like we we got out like as fast as we actually when we got to the car she was so frightened she she'd like crawl down to the floor   their counterpart on the left  I've been very critical as some  you may know  the black bloc  antifa for much the same reason I was  these dedustrialized pockets Anderson Indiana  one  the thgs I liked about as a writer I lie  joy reportg I I I like it because it when I go out it ten shatters my own assumptions about what is happeng  it keeps me tellectually honest so sometimes you know I can go to a subject  thk that I have a great body  knowledge I wrote a book on the Christian Right which has become unfortunately I thk fairly relevant to our particular political situation it's called American fascists the Christian Right  the war on America I was tryg to reach out to them  but I come out  the liberal church my father was a Presbyterian mister  course as you heard I'm a graduate   Divity School but I didn't really know much about the Christian right  I went  there with all sorts  assumptions    I would say even stereotypes about the kds  people who embrace this form  fundamentalism which i thk is is heretical it's Christian heresy but I couldn't listen to these stories  dislocation  pa sexual domestic abuse struggles with addictions evictions bankruptcies without havg it break my heart  it rewrote I rewrote the whole book the first chapter is called despair  it drove home to me what despair does  at the great study  the raw one  the great studies  the rise  fascism by fred stern is called the politics  cultural despair hannah errant  the origs  totalitarianism holds up despair aga i thk gog back to Durkheim that sense  worthlessness that sense  it propels people to a kd  magical thkg I also  the book was with Preppers  survivalists  Utah who have a little food  their bunker  a lot  ammunition but I thk that magical thkg what anthropologists call it crisis cults is a natural response to people who are just so overwhelmed by reality that they can't cope  when I was  Anderson so Anderson Indiana used to have most  the big GM plants  then Clton gave the gift  NAFTA to the American workg class  GM hightailed it down to Monterrey Mexico where they pay workers without any benefits or job security $3 an hour so your union salary  25  if you were a senior level over time you know you could be makg $50 an hour you had benefits you had a pension plan you you were medically covered you had you were  the UAW at job secured Saul vanished  Anderson went to the kd  tailsp that many dedustrialized pockets  the United States went to with all  the attendant problems cludg  course the rise  a caso like this whole idea  economic development through gamblg I watched that work try to work  Yugoslavia  it doesn't come to a good end the idea that you're gog to fill state revenue shortfalls with gamblg I mean so what was fascatg about Anderson is that most  these old UAW workers voted for Bernie Sers but when the general election came around they voted for Trump because they weren't gog to vote for Clton after NAFTA they were acutely aware  perhaps their anger was even greater at the Democratic Party than the an Party because it was the Democratic Party that had betrayed them that had pretended to fight for their terests  their concerns that contued to use the feel your pa language  traditional liberalism but had thrust a knife  their back  that betrayal is very dangerous it as it is you know two Baldw's when James Baldw writes about I'm  one  his essays he writes about why he thks africanamerican middleaged men don't have a midlife crisis the way white middleaged men do he said because africanamerican men are not prone to believe  the American Dream given the the forms  oppression that mutatg our prote  exists throughout our how to exist   havg always existed throughout American history  I thk that there's a certa wisdom  that that that these  course the highest  I write about suicide the highest percentage  people who commit suicide  this country which is an epidemic are middleaged white men people who realized that  fact the society has there is no place for them they they that the American the quoteunquote American dream was a lie  so what's happened   it's been a process over a few decades is that we have undergone what John Ralston saw calls a coup d'etat  slowmotion a corporate coup d'etat  slowmotion Sheldon Wol if you don't know Sheldon Wol please read him we just lost him a couple years ago I did a 3hour terview with him right before he died on YouTube which was very humblg I had reread all his books I had pages  notes there wasn't you can watch it it's it's remarkable tellectual pyrotechnics there was just nothg that I couldn't throw at that guy it was really quite spectacular as we had not been terviewed  over a decade was the last terview he gave but his book democracy corporated  then his masterpiece politics  vision are kd  semal works  politics  vision is ten considered by political scientists as one  the great political books on political philosophy produced  America  the 20th century  I thk that's not hyperbolic en calls the system verted totalitarianism  that he means that like the late roman republic you still have the facade you have the the iconography the language the stitutions  an open society  a democratic state but ternally corporations have seized all  the levers  power to render the citizen impotent   course what that does anytime a cabal seizes power whether it's Mh Arkell communist fascist corporate is  redirects all  the systems  government  stitutions towards their own empowerment  enrichment then you you you get a form  political paralysis the political system seizes up it no longer responds to the rights  legitimate grievances  the citizenry   fact extracts more  more  more out  a population that is already under deep distress   course that is what has happened  that's one  the reasons why it's important to get out to places like Indiana or buy right out  Scranton Pennsylvania where the city went bankrupt or almost went bankrupt  they had to sell f all  their utilities their sewer system this is not uncommon throughout dedustrialized centers  the United States   course corporations buy it up  then jack up the prices  these are gottg the IFRIC it's  the book I can't remember the average per capita come per family is like forty thous dollars a year or somethg that's pence not much   so you're extractg more  more  more from a population that has less  less  less  that is the process I mean clump Trump sorry Trump is as  course turbocharged the kleptocracy but it was there before he came    so what we're facg  what we're producg  what's ahead  us is the evitable collapse  the American Empire all  the warng signs that have brought down other empires throughout history are flashg red with the American Empire  I'll just take a few  those f one is the political paralysis the ability  the system to address the the justice is the economic deprivation the loss  rights  the population   fact to make it worse the other  course is somethg that even Bernie Sers doesn't like to talk about  that is the bloated militarism  imperialism that is hollowg the country out from the side so you have now 17 years  warfare  the Middle East there's a term at RF people have read fred McCoy wrote a good book I thk it's called this American Century is a great historian but he talks about what he calls micro militarism it's a term that historians use  what it is is that late empires evitably overreach they carry out acts  military folly  an effort to recapture a lost power so for stance the  the Athenian Empire they vade Sicily their entire fleet is sunk thouss  soldiers are killed  the Empire unravels their revolts throughout the empire or you look at the slow decle  the British Empire which really began at the end   War one but culmated  1956 when Nasser nationalizes the Suez Canal  the British vade attempt to vade   gog back to socco's book the Israelis take over Gaza for a hundred days  carry out wholesale massacres which is what his book is about footnotes  Gaza   they have an Eisenhower  will not support them largely because he won't give them credit to carry out this act  military adventurism  they retreat  humiliation  then what happens is the pound sterlg is dropped as the world's reserve currency  that  course is the deathblow  the american empire which is gog to happen one day the the once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency the the economy seizes up imports become phenomenally expensive we can't live f  the sale  Treasury bonds  because nobody wants them  you can look at what happened to the British economy  the 50s if you want to know what's comg  so you have a situation where you're squeezg your population harder  harder  harder for less  less  less   this is a characteristic with Joseph Tater writes about it  his great study the collapse  complex societies where he looks at I thk it's 2 different civilizations but he talks about that fal moment when the elites retreat to the equivalent  the Forbidden City or Versailles or  our country it's what a writer   New Yorker called richest Stan which means you fly on private jets  you never have any contact at all with anybody who doesn't make a few million dollars ear   so they have no connection with the reality  they squeeze  this case  course it's through debt peonage you know they borrowed all these banks all goldman sachs which is a crimal organization goldman sachs all  these corporations were able to borrow from the Fed trillions  dollars I mean there's various numbers for seven  at virtually zero percent terest but it does have to be paid back  so how is it paid back it's it's extracted from us that's 1. trillion dollars  student debt that is you're late on your credit card it's 28% that is you know even if you have health surance as anyone who has it can tell you the costs keep risg astronomically  terms  copay what they don't cover what the the pharmaceutical dustry which can jack up our you know the mile on but that's just one  many examples  the  the EpiPen so so you're extractg more  more from a population  how do you how do you deal with this kd  calcification or failed see  that is that at the same time you strip citizens  their rights you you reterpret constitutional rights you overturn them by judicial Fiat so for stance with Citizens United which allows the Koch brothers to control with dark money or Sheldon Adelson these figures are elections it becomes the right to petition the government or a form  free speech this is this is how citizens united is justified Edward Snowden exposes the fact that we are the most surveilled watched monitored eavesdropped population  human history  I covered the Stasi state  East Germany   course nothg is done to restore the constitutional right  privacy  if you wonder why it's so dangerous that they have everythg on every one  us cludg medical records you go back to Hannah Arendt's great book origs  totalitarianism  she writes about how despotic governments take formation or have files formation on every citizen so that at the moment that they seek to crimalize that person or a group they can twist whatever formation they have to justify it as a crime we also have courtesy  Barack Obama's signg  the 2011 ional Defense Authorization Act section 1021 which overturns the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act which had before prohibited the military from actg as a domestic police force  as some  you may know I sued Obama  federal court  to the chagr  the national security state one  the very courageous judge Kathere Forrest ruled  our favor  issued a temporary junction  I with hours  that junction lawyers from the NSA  had flown up  demed  the name  national security that she restate this act now this act allows the military to seize US citizens stripped them  due process  hold them defitely  military facilities   her opion which is worth readg she said this opens the path for the government to crimalize an entire group  people  she cites the 110,000 japaneseamericans who were terned   War two you militarized police forces  you create legal  physical mechanisms among demon ah the demonized segments  your population so that at a moment that the country becomes restive with a flick  a switch you can impose martial law or tyranny so  margal communities you have already res  terror 9%  the people  our prison system never get a jury trial they're forced to plea out  I have taught her  prison for 10 years  my the students I have with the longest sentences variably went to trial did not commit the crime for which they are charged went to trial though many people who are forced to plea guilty didn't commit the crime  nobody deserves almost no one  the system deserves the length  sentences or the conditions they're held under   they get the longest sentences because it has is a message sent to everyone else which is basically don't try this I mean they won't peel f the the charges  that's how a plea works they stack all sorts  try  they know you didn't do it I mean they love to put kidnappg on no matter what you did because it's 25 years so   it will go back to Aaron so Aaron writes about she herself is expelled from Germany strip diverse German citizenship fd yourself  France  writes about the plight  the stateless  she said once you create a mechanism with your society whereby for a segment  that society rights become privileges  we see it with what's happeng to undocumented people around us then you have the frastructure  the legal tools so that those privileges can be taken away from everyone  let's be very clear just to conclude that these corporate our corporate masters will stop at nothg if they feel that their prits are beg impeded  the great example  that  I was out there as stg rock so here you had a nonviolent protest by water protectors to safeguard their own not only their water but their l  the response  the state this was under Obama was credible credibly violent so over 700 arrests the use  attack dogs we're all talkg about nonviolent protesters subfreezg temperatures you're usg water cannons laced with pepper spray agast people constant filtration  this is somethg that I keep tellg the kids who I loved  Zuccotti they weren't quite aware  the extent to which the state is able to monitor  filtrate although there were moments  Zuccotti when it was out  a Doonesbury cartoon because some guy who clearly lifted weights  was  his 30s would show up  a baseball cap   tell everyone he was at Reed College but he forgot his ID card  the question was always the same after a few a little chitchat he goes so who are the leaders that was all with him  I mean the great the power  occupy was that everythg was transparent we're not gog to w this game unless we're transparent  it gets the whole issue if somebody wanted to ask about it about nonviolence which is the only way we're gog to w this game  so I remember one  these cops went to the head  the medical it was a medical tent  there  said to the woman runng  the medical tent so eventually came us so who are the leaders  she goes I am he goes oh really he goes well what's your title she goes god but what's not funny is that because these activists were usg electronic media but you know digital communication they knew who was important  after the under Obama coordated national effort they shut down occupy which for me was one  the great tragedies  our time because if the state had responded rationally to the very moderate dems  the Occupy movement forgivg student debt universal health care a jobs program especially targeted people under the age  25 it would have actually gone a long way to amelioratg the pressure which has now only gotten worse but unfortunately the state did not respond rationally  I know I'm a little over but just let me close by talkg about Trump Trump is the symptom he's not the disease  I watched this same kd  political deformity  deterioration  Yugoslavia  you can go back  look at vimar Eric vogel writes about it  the  Hitler  the Germans where he talks about how you know this idea that Hitler mesmerised or hypnotizes ridiculous what it tapped to was a kd   Kohei rage  frustration  sense  betrayal because after the 1929 crash the socialist government the socialdemocrats under Ebert  Vai Mar imposed the same kds  programs  austerity that were pushed on him by the banks so they even suspended if you can believe it unemployment surance people could even get unemployment surance  that Nazis were  twenty eight were pollg  the sgle digits after the crash  course   the policy  austerity  I  then it gets to the whole we can go back to Rosa Luxemburg on the fry Corps  all that but the they they people embraced these figures who were everybody knew they were buffoonish  the same way that everyone knows Trump is buffoonish as the same way that everybody knew Radovan Karadzic are slobodan milosevic our friend your twos men were buffoonish because they because  the anger at the system  my fear as I watched the Democratic Party  the mastream commercial media is that they don't get it they contue to play this reality show game did Russia try  terfere that well yeah probably but Trump is not a product   Russian terference Trump is a product  grotesque social equality   course the Democratic Party doesn't want to address that issue because they are an appendage  corporate power yes they're not the they are  the spectrum  corporate power that doesn't want to be identified as a racist or xenophobe or a homophobe but they do nothg to halt the cannibalization  corporations Nord    course that a part  that is the wars that we are wagg it makes no sense to rema with the Taliban now controls more territory  Afghanistan they did than they did when we went  so why are we still there well I mean look at the stock prices  Raytheon Halliburton you know cruise missile costs what 1.1 million dollars let's drop 50  them on Libya it's it's good for money it's good for prit for the war dustry but it's not good for anyone over there  it's certaly not good for us  then I guess I'll happy to take any any questions anyone else []  I agree with you for the most part it's very depressg  you didn't even mention climate you know I didn't it's  the book that's the pickmeup chapter but I thk I'm older than you  yes you know the empires have collapsed but this happened very quickly I mean with the scope  my lifetime I was born  the 0s I grew up  the 50s  Massachusetts  the country was on a roll not everyone not not the blacks  the south we didn't know about well I didn't know about it but the people who were left had gotten through the depression they had gotten through the war they had been led by Roosevelt  we felt that progress was just evitable   the 60s because the country was dog so well it seemed okay to open thgs up my late husb was at the EEOC the whole idea was to be more clusive  it all sort  began to turn  1980 or  the 70s with Nixon  1980 with Ronald Reagan  Milton Friedman which gave you this corporate culture but it's happened so fast that I don't see why it can't still be turned around okay I mean it's a good question it started actually earlier because it started with I mean you had the collapse  capitalism  the 1930s right Roosevelt was a product  the radical movements the Communist Party we've kd  erased the Communist Party from American history I'm not a communist but they you know the whole whole sits that Mart Luther Kg used you know Rusk was aware  this they'd been be used  the 1920s by the Communist Party would you  that's why paul robeson or w/e two boys jo the Communist Party because even the Socialists under Debs were hostile to African Americans   so we Roosevelt astutely understood I mean Roosevelt said that his greatest achievement was that he saved capitalism  he understood that if the private sector didn't create jobs for American citizens given the unemployment good job we better create jobs so he created twelve mute jobs if if elderly people are slit early starvg  malnourished  their apartments then we better create Social Security  the corporate oligarchs made two fatal mistakes one they went after the radicals  the they recreated the red scares  the 1920s  the 1950s  Shrek err Ellen trekker has written two very fe books on this  you forget how pervasive that purgg was  we're not talkg about necessarily Communists we're talkg about anybody with a social conscience so the FBI was gog to high schools with a list this is  trekkers book sayg him him hurt her out no evidence nothg  they're blacklisted the the assault on journalism it's how I have stone ends up  his basement writg I have stones weekly the assault on Hollywood on entertament so that began to destroy the the the popular radical movements which has  pots out were the forces that opened up our democracy we had a we have a closed system every time I hear by the deification  the foundg fathers I just want to fall over I'm these people were racist they supported the genocide I mean read what they wrote about eradicatg the Indians Washgton was the wealthiest man  the United States they were misogynist you know on  on  on  we paid for with blood we had the bloodiest labor Wars  any dustrialized country so they went after the radical movements then they went after the liberal class  I wrote a book on it called death  the liberal class where  as Chomsky pots out I told Noam for the liberal class everythg I learned about the liberal class I learned from Noam Chomsky so I should have put by Chris Hedges  Noam Chomsky except I didn't get his permission to do it as Chomsky pots out the liberal class was never designed to be the political left it was designed to be the safety valve what Karl Popper writes about  the the enemies  the open society it was designed to ameliorate to adjust the system the way Roosevelt did  so they have Visser ated the liberal establishment  then we got the great traitor  liberalism Bill Clton who really sold American people down the river oh  we can just take it f NAFTA the greatest betrayal  workg men  women sce the tafthartley Act deregulatg the FCC so these troglodytes from Clear     can consolidate control we have about six corporations are five control 90%  what people listen to  it's doctrated trap talk about it's fake news I mean real fake news he passes the 9 omnibus crime bill so the prison population explodes from 700,000 he destroys glasssteagall he destroys welfare  70%  the origal recipients  the old welfare program were children  every time I heard Hillary Clton talk about her concern for mothers so  Obama went any better but that's another story so that the the the we we created this it was a gradual process   that process we D dustrialized so as Charles Mayer the  historian says by the 1970s we had shifted from an empire  production to an empire  consumption meang that we were borrowg to mata both a lifestyle  a military we could no loan afford  now we're payg for it that's a long answer go ahead thank you I agree with every word that you spoken tonight mmhmm but I want to pick up with what that lady said at the very end we must not get defeatist we have to thk that there is a way out  this  to describe it is very important but we have to start structurg our thought I mean for example all  us are many people are  the system so there excuse me there is a leverage  people to change their mds to change the philosophy  I'd like you to speak a little bit about that because I don't want us to get so down that we really thk we can't I mean this this gets to the whole issue  hope I you know I come out  war I spent 20 years coverg war i I don't share the cultures mania for hope I heard very bleak situations I was  Sarajevo durg the war  my job as a war correspondent was to make a very cold rational calculation about the weapons systems around me  the possibility for destruction  then to act  we mentioned she mentioned climate change which I haven't spoken about but I mean we've known about climate change sce 1902  we've done nothg which kd  implodes the New Atheists now I can't the Chomsky calls them the religious fanatics for the state religion sam harris etc the the it implodes this idea that we're rational human begs  I thk that you know Rehold Niebuhr has her are you side no let me are you  such despair yourself I mean there's not as a criticism but have you given up so much hope but I have but but the fact is you can't use the word hope if you don't resist oh but  so we have to we have to carry out because the very act  resistance or rebellion at that moment makes you a free human beg but at the same time it doesn't do us any good not to grasp the crisis the the the mortal crisis that we face not only as a nation but as a species  I thk that is the great existential struggle  the whereby we we have to see reality for what it is  then we have to resist but most people who rebel the great you know the great rebels Toussat L'Ouverture are Sittg Bull or Malcolm or they they you know but  the eyes  the world they didn't succeed but  fact what they did is hold up that other narrative  I would then go to my own background as a semarian I once asked Daniel Berrigan the great radical priest  poet how he defed faith  he said faith is the belief that the good draws to it the good even if empirically everyone everythg around us says otherwise  I thk that if we are gog to resist successfully we are gog to have to do so  a not  an orthodox way emma goldman fundamentally i thk had a deep religious impulse we are gog to have to believe as beragon says that the good draws to it the good even if empirically everythg around us gets worse but you know Sartre writes about it the the utopianism  the practical I can't remember his exact phrase my son's here you can tell us but III we are gonna have to see how dire it is  look I'm not the only one  this room who has kids  even if we fail we have to I want my kids to look back  say he tried so I thk on the one h we do have to face how bleak it is on the other h we can't let that despair cripple us but I look at this you know this kd  evitable human progress or technology will save us as as foolish as the denial  global warmg thank you [] two quick questions if Trump for a chance is impeached do you feel that the backlash could result  on civil strife  the second question is you are on RT  I do watch our tea for time time thgs I have some terestg programmg but I do feel a little onesided I was wonderg what is your experience with art okay well  terms  Trump Trump skills go back to Noam Chomsky  he Trotsky says correctly that if we lose Trump  get Pence it's gonna be worse why because  that's why I mentioned my book on the Christian Right the the Trump has no ideology it's an ideological vacuum he doesn't I mean as far as I can tell he's  the early stages  dementia  it certaly appears that way Ronald Reagan had it but they covered it up a little better so what he is fillg that vacuum with is the fascist ideology  the Christian Right  if you thk it's not fascist flick on the TV  watch Sarah Sers who lies like the day is long  then tells you what a great Christian she is I come back another time  talk about the Christian Right but let me just say at its core it's it's about heat at its core it's a very frighteng movement it has all the hallmarks  a totalitarian movement  it is fused the Christian religion with the state which the German Christian Church did as far as RT excuse me uh isn't quite answered the question the question was if he's  peace will there be civil strife well yeah but I'm sayg that one it'll be worse  I'm not sure that there will be civil strife because they will have pence pence is is a product  the Christian Right  while Trump caters to the Christian Right you have to remember the crib a have all these stitutions they built Liberty  with its own law school  its own systems  doctration through cable channels  so IIIi don't thk there'll be civil strife because  fact that Christianized fascism which this segment  the population yearns for will become more pronounced  terms  our tea look if we had a functiong public broadcastg system critics  corporate capitalism  imperialism would have a voice but   particular is a wholly owned subsidiary  the Koch brothers    the destruction  public broadcastg  the 60s you could watch Baldw Malcolm they were all on Zn Chomsky it's vanished  so critics such as myself are beg pushed to the margs not only  the electronic media lscape but the Internet now they've imposed all these algorithms  the name  fake news  course proper not thank you the Washgton  this anonymous site that listed us as tools  Russia right for TruthDig but all  the sites that reprt my stuff common dreams counterpunch they've all been targeted  alternate so you get what they call impression so before they impose the algorithms if you typed  imperialism  I had written an article recently on imperialism it would come up now it doesn't now we have we charted it  truth dig the impressions have fallen  the last year from over 700,000 to below 200,000 as they perfect the algorithm alternates traffic has fallen by 63% world socialist website then we have to add net neutrality  the question is why the reason is because nobody is buyg this neoliberal crap this ideology read David Harvey spoke on neoliberalism that has just been a kd  ideological veneer for unadulterated greed by the 1% was your experience though well my experience is that they allow me you know to express these views remember I covered Eastern Europe so if you wanted to hear Vaslav Havel the only place you were gonna hear Havel was Voice  America Havel didn't support American imperialism or the US war but that was the only space that he had  I'm you know critics such as my gnomes completely blacked out Nader I mean these people are just blocked out  that's the goal   once we throw  net neutrality on the goal is to create tears on the ternet so that these leftwg sites become harder  harder to access go ahead so with our mastream media creasgly corporatized  spewg out false narratives with no one speakg up about the fate  people like Julian Assange yeah with no one talkg about what Edward Snowden tried to warn us about  with Google  Yahoo shuttg down websites  dflat do the platformg controversial sources every day how can we possibly extricate ourselves from this situation without any broad voice I mean there's there's no kd  well anythg we can turn okay so it's not like there aren't huge segments  the population that are conscious I mean you see the group here tonight there are people who are conscious  they know they're beg lied to  I you know   the start let's go back to the Stasi state  East Germany or the old Czech  both  which I covered as I covered the Velvet Revolution so what was amazg was how conscious people were even with the imposition  the iron control  formation so when the Velvet Revolution took place everyone knew that Havel  you know there's somethg about Havel I was  the Magic Lantern theater with him every night  Prague the terestg thg about habul is that he wasn't charismatic he wasn't a particularly good speaker but they knew he won gonna sell them out he had the moral authority oh   I've told this story but I'll tell it aga there there is you know  fear will make people quiet but they know  so that whole wter there were posters all over Prague  Yann Pollock who had a charles university student who to protest the 1968 Soviet vasion had gone to vents less square lit himself on fire four days later died  his burns they his funeral was which attracted hundreds  people mostly students was never broadcast by state media or covered his grave became a shre they exhumed his remas cremated his remas gave them to his mother said she couldn't bury them that wter his poster was everywhere when the communist government fell 10,000 people marched to Red Army Square  renamed it Yan Pollock square mark tacuba shaiva the great sger sang the prayer from our toe the anthem  defiance that was broadcast on the airwaves as the Soviet tanks rolled  after the overthrow  Dubcek  the imposition  the prosoviet government she her recordg stock is destroyed she's banned from the airwaves between 1968  1989 she works at an assembly le at a toy factory I was vent celeste square she walked out on the balcony she began to sg the prayer for Marta  every check  that crowd knew every word that is the power  resistance what Auden calls the ironic pot  light that flashes out wherever the just exchanged the messages  that's why tyrants  despots are terrified  the truth because people see it people feel it  there's more people out there that yeah I mean you're right I mean  they are tryg to shut it down but the the lies are now so egregious  so transparent that you know a margal critic such as myself suddenly becomes a threat because that truth is a threat  so totalitarian systems are quite effective at  the corporate state is quite effective at controllg the message but I  I just traveled all over the country for this book I can tell you people are far more conscious but with the ternet completely  the power  these corporations  knowg everythg about us  usg it agast us how can we know that wasn't around   1969  this is what we face today how can we overcome that   that parallel your experience you know as despotic regimes deteriorate they force resistance to create parallel systems so I write about Anderson Indiana where they these old former Catholic Worker people have bought a warehouse does the end  the book chapter freedom  they are literally because their stories are not told people trapped  the gig economy they literally prt they prt they prt it up  write it  dissemate it I'm not sayg I mean you're right to be concerned about it but that doesn't mean they're gonna w so broad question 2016 was probably the first time I had been politically engaged after beg  the Army for some time  beg deployed just that's a whole another world to even expla that to people that a culture that really doesn't want the story  what happens overseas  the name  empire to be told at all that's right um but where where does the left go from go from here um if I fd it to be a very sad state Jill Ste's name has pretty much been drug through the mud she she can probably no longer effectively participate  the political system the Democratic Party as much as Ocasio Cortez seems like she'll brg change she she still has to go up agast a huge apparatus yeah that will silence her I thk where we go where do we go um we go to the street we look at people like Stg Rock we look at the all  the great radical movements that were shut out  power I mean we've gone through vicious periods  American history you know people I was I don't know if you know James Caan but if you don't you should read them cross Anna Lynch  we've just lost him just a most important theologian  America  one  the great moral voices  our time but as James kept sayg you know people will say Malcolm was so radical Malcolm Malcolm said what he said  Harlem when Kg got up  said what he said  Montgomery it meant that the next day walkg down the street he could be dead  I thk that we have to uncover or fd aga with us that kd  moral courage represented by the great figures  resistance  we have to beg what we saw  South Africa which brought down apartheid which is noncooperation we have to do everythg  our power to build alternative structures to pit power agast power  we have to do everythg  our power to obstruct the workgs  the corporate state  that's what the Wobblies did that's what the old CIO did that's what they did  the civil rights movement that's what the Communist Party did that's what the Progressive Party did we have antecedents they erase this from American history that's what the bonus marchers did which  course MacArthur went   evicted them by force  you know we have the politics is a game  fear  we have to make them frightened  us that's our goal that's the only way they're kept  check so there's a passage  Kissger's memoirs which hopefully is not beg sold  this bookstore do not go buy it it's 1971 tens  thouss  antiwar protesters around the White House Nixon has put empty city buses   around the White House's barricades  he's stg at the wdow lookg out wrgg his hs next to Kissger gog Henry they're gog to break through the barricades  get us it's our job to make people  power feel fear that's our job  until we do that  believe me you know I so I have relatives who are on    Zuccotti which was absolutely did not pose any physical threat to these predators on   they were terrified they wouldn't even go out for lunch they were gettg they had all their private security firms tweetg or tellg them every hour they're on Bond  now they have a giant puppet octopus  front  Goldman Sachs you know really you know they're a lot you know you know why they're so scared because they know even better than we do how corrupt  fixed the system is that's why Bernanke was on his knee  unfortunately Obama didn't st up for us he stood up for the bankers so that's it that's the only Hubbell we we didn't talked about climate change I mean that's why Stg Rock is so important that's why blockg the railroad tracks  the North West who are brgg down the pediment isn't that's what we got to do that's it    I thk they they underst how hated they are   that makes them weak  that's gets to the whole issue  violence as the great  they were talkg about revolution by the way I'm talkg about the overthrow  the corporate state  for the homel security person who's here that's overthrow Oh Vee are because these people are gog to kill us  they're gonna kill my children    the end you know they these corporate forces have us they have us by the throat  they have my kids by the throat  I don't know if we're gonna w I don't even know if we're gonna survive as a species but  the end I don't fight fascism because I w I fight fascists because they are fascists  that moral almost religious quality is one that we have to embrace what Niebuhr called sublime madness that understg that radical evil must be opposed even if everythg around us says that we will fail  when we fd that  when we have the courage to st up  defy it we may not w  an ultimate sense but we will be free I mean I teach  a prison they imposed a rule  the prison that although my students had to walk past the guards down the corridors with their eyes down  they refused they walk down the quarters with their eyes up it sounds a little but it's not that's what we have to do  we have to underst that not the Democratic Party no but no system now there are no stitutions  this country left that are authentically democratic there are no stitutions that are gog to protect us or protect our children or protect the ecosystem on which we depend for life it's up to us  at least let us fd that courage so that whatever generation comes after us will say they were not passive  they were not complicit as a fundamentalist say say on prophet I thk you mister callg but that's why I came here tonight was to get the answer on dealg with despair  your latest article by the way  truth peg is about climate change yeah  you go all the way to the wall basically implyg that no matter what we do we're gonna lose this battle  that's um I would like you to do an article  TruthDig about what you said tonight because I've never heard you say all this stuff before so I have said it before   I but I thk the pot is I mean if we take the climate the global warmg I mean just a factual understg I mean even if we stop all carbon admissions today we are still gog to be dealg with catastrophic effects  climate change   course under the the Trump admistration they're rollg back whatever tea pad before they have  we don't have any time left  I thk part  it's an imperative for us to grasp how little time we have left I mean climate scientists are quite clear that once we get below 2% above 2% Celsius we may get to the kds  feedback loops that have that create  the temperatures on Venus which are 800 degrees that that  it ras sulfuric acid um that that's where we are   there is no serious climate scientist that disputes that  yet you know I thk I talk about the mania for hope I thk if we understood the emergency that we're  we might beg to react but it's  course it fills me I mean my youngest son will his favorite book is out  the blue so it's like NARR Wales  I'm thg it may very well  probably will be that  your lifetime everythg sgle one  those species doesn't exist that's  I thk that when we underst how precarious our situation is  stop foolg ourselves we will react   it goes back to that sublime madness I mean that  the end it is most revolutionaries rebels throughout history don't succeed but we have to   I thk that way we actually overcome despair by resistg I mean I do I mean I was been a Ritz boutique a rat never heard that from that statement from you before I mean look you know I've been arrested  front  the White House I've been arrested  front  goldman sachs  it that that kd  solid eras rested with a hundred  thirty three vets  front  the White House   the wter snowg  so as Vietnam vets Iraqi war vets Afghan vets  it was I mean it was a religious experience it was so movg these people knew the horror  war the poison  militarism  when it when it came time to walk to the White House fence  get arrested it's on YouTube somebody's beatg a drum that's it nobody speaks  fact most  the people  the crowd are cryg  when you sit home alone when you attempt as an dividual to cope with the pround despair that we almost feel it will conquer you but when you build relationships  not electronically but the way relationships can only be built  that is persontoperson when you build community  when you carry out acts  resistance that act  resistance is the best antidote to despair thank you we have one more yes I I okay I actually had a serious question but it's I realized time is short basically you never hear anythg about the money system  progressive discussions  I would love that to be addressed more not the money system he'll talk about banks  so on but it's much more complex than that but I do want to take this opportunity to thank you personally I realized as that progressive about two years ago that I could no longer contue to kill  exploit animals for my pleasure you know you don't get to talk about it that much but you spired me to go vegan  it's it's changed my life completely so I just say thank you well let me if you care about climate change the animal agriculture dustry many people argue is the greatest contributor to global warmg  you can get up tomorrow  that's somethg you can do it's also healthier but that I mean it was it the environmental factor that pushed me to become vegan because whatever I do  my life it's it's an act it was an easy action to take  aga it it is part  that assault that we all must carry out agast corporate power  then we get to a whole issue  how they treat animals  the  the antibiotics they pump to them  everythg else but yeah thank you for brgg that up I thk it's an important thg that we can all do I am  light  your comments about resistg takg it to the streets shuttg it down I know that buzzword now is we all need to choose civility but I just noticed when you when you began you've made some comments about the antifa demonstrators  they didn't sound very positive could you sort  exp on that a bit well I've written about it I movement I wrote about the black bloc  I call them the cancer  Occupy look the problem with an Tifa  the black bloc is that  the name  diversity  tactics they really only have one tactic they serve the terests  the state  the terests  the state is to demonize the resistance movement make people afraid  it   filtrated  I would argue that the huge percentage  these people are cops filtrate it  get them to carry out acts  violence to justify state repression you want to know who wrote the best about an anarchist violence is Len he got it he understood how dangerous that was to the revolution  look resistance is not a form  catharsis it's a form it's tactics its strategic our job is to brg them down  as the great theorist  revolution crane Brton Jeffrey Davies have all  others have poted out no revolution succeeds  this was true  the revolutions I covered  Eastern Europe until a significant percentage  the the security apparatus  the civil bureaucracy defects because once they defect it creates paralysis so I was  East Germany you have demonstrations  leipzig erich honecker the communist dictator for 19 years sends down an elite paratroop division which is gonna fire on the crowd they get there the local communist authorities block it Hahn occurs out  power with a week that's because these people no I mean these you know I used to get  a battle about tauntg the cops  Zuccotti  I remember kd  flippantly which I shouldn't have done you know sayg to a group  Zuccotti the people who carried out the most egregious abuses  Zuccotti were the white church they were the ficers once the white shirts weren't around the there was a lot  almost fraternization between the blue uniformed  the kids so I  this talk I said look you know you'll we only have to deal with the white shirts for a couple  these white shirt at assholes for a couple hours a day these cops have to deal with them all day long so they've shut down Zuccotti  I'm givg a talk  New York  at the end this man comes up to me  he goes I'm a white shirt at asshole  I read all  your books now he might be the only one but I shouldn't have said that because we will not succeed unless we brg with us substantial sections  those with the power system  look I thk they passed section 1021  the ional Defense Authorization Act because ultimately the elites don't trust the police to protect them  when we  this twoyear legal battle we went before the it was Obama appealed it to the Second Circuit the appellate   course they were stuck because it's totally unconstitutional so they don't want to have to rule on it  they four months they sit on it sit on it  sit on it  I was also a platiff  clapper versus Amnesty International about wholesale surveillance before the Snowden revelations where government lawyers got up  said that I  the other platiffs were just speculatg about government surveillance  then added if the government was monitorg them we would tell them okay so they threw it out because we didn't have stg that's the way they deny our rights  so then the Second Circuit said he doesn't have stg he can't brg the case  we filed a cert but durg that whole to the Supreme Court they wouldn't take it but durg that twoyear battle we went to the Democratic leadership we went to Pelosi the lawyers we said look they passed section 1021 every year boy if they do is pass it  say it doesn't apply to u.s. citizens  we drop the lawsuit but  course they weren't gog to put because it does apply to u.s. citizens  I forgot your question  Tifa oh yeah so an Tifa plays to what they want which is a militarized states  as I tell look I was overseas somebody that asked question was overseas he'll second me havg been around special forces we have 60,000  them they're called death squads the state has the capacity to flict levels  violence that we can't even beg to image  that's just a route that is utterly selfdestructive  so I have been quite vocal  my attacks agast an T from the Black Bloc because I see them as counterproductive to what we're tryg to accomplish [] [] you"
103,1.0,"good eveng I'm Ruth Heer Feld  the League  Women Voters education fund next Tuesday is election day before gog to the polls voters want to underst the issues  know the cidates positions tonight voters will have an opportunity to see  hear the major party cidates for the presidency state their views on issues that affect us all the League  Women Voters is proud to present this presidential debate our moderator is Howard K Smith Thank You mrs. Hee Feld the League  Women Voters is pleased to welcome to the Clevel Ohio Convention Center  Hall President Jimmy Carter the Democratic Party's cidate for reelection to the presidency  governor Ronald Reagan  California the an Party's cidate for the presidency the cidates will debate questions on domestic economic foreign policy  national security issues the questions are gog to be posed by a panel  distguished journalists who here with me they are Marv stone the editor  US    Report Harry Ellis national correspondent  the Christian  Monitor William Hilliard assistant managg editor  the Portl Oregonian Barbara Walters correspondent   the ground rules for this is agreed by you gentlemen for these each panelists down here will ask a question the same question to each  the two cidates after the two cidates have answered a panelist will ask followup questions to try to sharpen the answers the cidates will then have an opportunity each to to make a rebuttal that will constitute the first half  the debate  I will state the rules for the second half later on some other rules the cidates are not permitted to brg prepared notes to the podium but are permitted to make notes durg the debate if the cidates exceed the allotted time agreed on I will reluctantly but certaly terrupts we asked the Convention Center audience here to abide by one ground rule please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval durg the debate now based on a toss  the co governor Reagan will respond to the first question from Marv stone governor as you're well aware the question  war  peace has emerged as a central issue  this campaign  the givetake  recent weeks President Carter's been criticized for respondg late to agressive Soviet impulses for sufficient buildup  our armed forces  a paralysis  dealg with Afghanistan  Iran you have been criticized for beg all too quick to advocate the use  lots  muscle military action to deal with foreign crises specifically what are the differences between the two  you on the uses  American military power I don't know what the differences might be because I don't know what mr. Carter's policies are I do know what he has said about me  I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace  that use  force is always  only a last resort when everythg else has failed  then only with regard to our national security now I believe also that this meetg this mission is responsibility for preservg the peace which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country that we cannot shirk our responsibility as the leader  the free world because we're the only one that can do it  therefore the burden  matag the peace falls on us  to mata that peace requires strength America has never gotten  a war because we were too strong we can get to a war by lettg events get out  h as they have  the last three  a half years under the foreign policies  this admistration  mr. Carter's until we're faced each time with a crisis  good management  preservg the peace requires that we control the events  try to tercept before they become a crisis but I have seen four wars  my lifetime I'm a father  sons I have a grson I don't ever want to see another generation  young Americans bleed their lives to Sy Beach heads  the Pacific or rice paddies  jungles  the  Asia or the muddy blood  bloody fields  battlefields  Europe mr. stone do you have a followup question for the governor yes governor we've been hearg that the defense buildup that you would associate yourself with would cost tens  billions  dollars more than is now contemplated  assumg that the American people are ready to bear this cost they nevertheless keep askg the followg question how do you reconcile huge creases  military outlays with your promise  substantial tax cuts   balancg the budget which  this fiscal year when the just ended ran more than sixty billion dollars  the red mr. stone I have submitted an economic plan that I've worked out  concert with a number  fe economists  this country all  whom approve it  believe that over a fiveyear projection this plan can permit the extra spendg for needed refurbishg  our defensive posture that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier  that we can't afford along with the cuts that I have proposed  government spendg we can't afford the tax cuts I have proposed  probably maly because mr. Carter's economic policy has built to the next five years  on beyond that a tax crease that would be takg 86 billion dollars more next year out  the people's pockets than was taken this year  my tax cut does not come close to elimatg that 86 billion dollar crease I'm only reducg the amount  the crease  other words what I'm talkg about is not puttg government back to gettg less money than governments been gettg but simply cuttg the crease the   spendg the same question now goes to President Carter President Carter would you like to have the question repeated yes President Carter the question  war  peace a central issue  this campaign you've been criticized for  the givetake for respondg late to agressive Soviet impulses for an sufficient buildup  armed forces  a paralysis  dealg with Afghanistan  Iran Governor Reagan on the other h has been criticized for beg all too quick to advocate the use  lots  muscle military action to deal with foreign crises such as I mentioned specifically what are the differences between the two  you on the uses  American military power mr. stone have had to make thouss  decisions sce I've been president servg  the Oval Office  with each one  those decisions that affect the future  my country I have learned  the process I thk I'm a much wiser  more experienced man than I was when I debated for years ago agast President Ford I've also learned that they are no simple answers to complicated questions HL Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer it would be neat  plausible  wrong the fact is that this nation  the eight years before I became president had its own military strength decrease seven out  eight years the budget commitments for defense went down 37 percent  all sce I've been  fice we've had a steady carefully planned methodical but very effective crease  our commitment for defense but what we've done is to use that enormous power   prestige  military strength  the United States to preserve the peace we've not only kept peace for our own country but we've been able to extend the benefits  peace to others  the Middle East we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel  Egypt successfully  have tied ourselves together with Israel  Egypt  a common defense capability this is a very good step forward for our nation security  we will contue to do as we've done  the past I might also add that there are decisions that are made  the Oval Office by every president which are pround  nature there are always trouble spots  the world  how those troubled areas are addressed by president alone  that Oval Office affects our nation directly the volvement  the United States  also our American terests that is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently by every president who serves that's what I try to do successfully by keepg our country at peace mr. stone do you have a followup yes I would like to be a little more specific on the use military power  let's talk about one area for a moment under what circumstances would you use military forces to deal with for example a shut f  Persian oil Gulf if that should occur or to counter a Russian expansion beyond Afghanistan to either Iran or Pakistan I asked this question  view  charges that we are woefully unprepared to project sustaed  I emphasize the word sustaed power  that part  the world missed out  my State  the Union address earlier this year I poted out that any threat to the stability  security  the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security  our own country  the past we've not had an adequate military presence  that region now we have two major carrier task forces we have access to facilities  five different areas  that region  we've made it clear that workg with our allies  others that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventualities which by terrupts commerce with that crucial area  the world but  dog this we have made sure that we address this question peacefully not jectg American military forces  the combat but lettg the strength  our nation be felt  a beneficial way this I believe has assured that our terest will be protected  the Persian Gulf region as we've done  the Middle East  throughout the world Governor Reagan you have a mute to comment or rebut well yes I questioned the figure about the decle  defense spendg out  the two previous admistrations  the precedg eight years to this admistration I would call to your attention that we were  a war that wound down durg those eight years which  course made a change  military spendg because  turng from war to peace I also would like to pot out the an presidents  those years faced with a Democratic majority  both houses  the Congress found that their requests for defense budgets were very ten cut now Gerald Ford left a fiveyear projected plan for a military buildup to restore our defenses  President Carter's admistration reduced that by 38 percent cut 60 ships out  the Navy buildg program that had been proposed  stopped the b1 delayed the cruise missiles stopped the production le for the Muteman missiles stopped the Trident sir delayed the Trident submare  now is planng a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots  the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one that is quick to look for use  force President Carter you have the last word on this question well there are various elements  Defense um one is to control nuclear weapons which I hope we'll get to later on because that's the most important sgle issue  this campaign another one is how to address troubled areas  the world I thk habitually governor Reagan has advocated the jection  military forces to troubled areas when I  my predecessors both Democrats  ans have advocated resolvg those troubles  those difficult areas  the world peacefully diplomatically  through negotiation the addition  that the buildup  military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength  order to preserve the peace but I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired  combat  the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field  battle strength is imperative for peace but the two must go h  h thank you gentlemen the next question is from Harry Ellis to President Carter mr. president when you were elected  1976 the consumer price dex stood at .8% it now sts at more than 12% perhaps more significantly the nation's broader underlyg flation rate has gone up from seven to ne percent now a part  that was due to external factors beyond US control notably the more than doublg  oil prices by OPEC last year because the United States remas vulnerable to such external shocks can flation  fact be controlled if so what measures would you pursue  a second term aga it's important to put the situation to perspective  197 we had a socalled oil shock where the price  OPEC oil was raised to an extraordary degree we had an even worse old shock  1979  197 we had the worst recession the deepest  most penetratg recession sce the Second  War the recession that resulted this time was a briefest we've had sce the Second  War  addition we've brought down flation early this year the first quarter we did have a very severe flation pressure brought about by the OPEC price crease Everage to about 18% the first quarter this year the second quarter we had dropped it down to about 13 percent the most recent figures the last three months  the third quarter  this year the flation rate is seven percent still too high but it illustrates very vividly that  addition to providg an enormous number  9 million new jobs  the last three  a half years that the flationary threat is still urgent on us I noticed that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan Kemp Roth proposal which his own runng mate rge Bush described as boudu economics  said that it would result  a 30% flation rate  week which is not a democratic publication said that this Reagan contra proposal  I quote them I thk was completely irresponsible  would result  flationary pressures which would destroy this nation so our proposals are very sound  very carefully considered to stimulate jobs to improve the dustrial complex  this country to create tools for American workers  at the same time would be antiflationary  nature so to add 9 million new jobs to control flation  to plan for the future was a energy policy now tact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead mr. Ellis do you have a followup question from mr. Carter yes mr. president you have mentioned the creation  9 million new jobs at the same time the unemployment rate still hangs high as does the flation rate now I wonder can you tell us what additional policies you would pursue  a second admistration  order to try to brg down that flation rate  would it be an act  leadership to tell the American people they're gog to have to sacrifice to adopt a leaner lifestyle for some time to come yes we have demed that the American people sacrifice  they've done very well as a matter  fact we're importg today about onethird less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago we've had a 25% reduction sce the first year I was  fice at the same time as I said earlier we have added about 9 million net new jobs  that period  time a record never before achieved also the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors one conservation which requires sacrifice  the other one crease  production  American energy which is gog along very well more coal this year than ever before  history more oil  gas wells drilled this year than ever before  history a new economic revitalization program that we have  md which will be implemented next year would result  tax credits which would let busess vest  new tools  new factories to create even more new jobs about a million  the next two years  we also have planned a Youth Employment Program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people this has already passed the House now has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate now the same question goes to governor Reagan governor Reagan would you like to have the question repeated governor Reagan durg the past four years the Consumer Price Index has risen from .8% to currently over 12%  perhaps more significantly the nation's broader underlyg rate  flation has gone up from 7 to 9 percent now a part  that has been due to external factors beyond US control  notably the more than doublg  OPEC oil prices last year which leads me to ask you whether sce the United States remas vulnerable to such external shocks can flation  fact be controlled if so specifically what measures would you pursue mr. Ellis I thk this idea that has been spawned here  our country that flation somehow came upon us like a plague  therefore it's uncontrollable  no one can do anythg about it is entirely spurious  it's dangerous to say this to the people when mister Carter became president flation was .8% as you said it had been cut  two by President Gerald Ford it is now runng at twelve pot seven percent President Carter also has spoken  the new jobs created what we always with the normal growth  our country an crease  population crease the number  jobs but that can't hide the fact that there are 8 million men  women out  work  America today  2 million  those lost their jobs  just the last few months mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight agast flation  yet his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity  gross national product  crease unemployment  order to get a hle on flation because   January at the begng  the year it was more than 18% sce then he has blamed to the people for flation OPEC he's blamed the Federal Reserve System he has braed the lack  productivity the American people he has then accused the people  livg too well  that we must share  scarcity we must sacrifice  get used to dog with less we don't have flation because the people are livg too well we have flation because the government is livg too well  the last statement just a few days ago was a speech to the effect that we have flation because government revenues have not kept pace with government spendg I see my time is runng out here I'll have to get this down very fast yes you can lick flation by creasg productivity  by decreasg the cost  government to the place that we have balanced budgets  are no longer runng grdg out prtg press money floodg the market with it because the government is spendg more than it takes   my economic plan calls for that the president's economic plan calls for creasg the taxes to the pot that we fally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget  that way but we'll have a very poor nation  a very unsound economy if we follow that path followup mr. Ellis yes you have centered on cuttg government spendg  what you have just said about your own policies you have also said that you would crease defense spendg specifically where would you cut government spendg if you were to crease defense spendg  also cut taxes so that presumably federal revenues would shrk well most people when they thk about cuttg government spendg they thk  terms  elimatg necessary programs or wipg out somethg some service that government is supposed to perform I believe that there is enough extravagance  fact  government as a matter  fact one  the secretaries  hgw under mr. Carter testified that he thought there was 7 billion dollars worth  fraud  waste  welfare   the medical programs associated with it we've had the General Accountg Office estimate that there is probably tens  billions  dollars that is lost  fraud alone  they have added that waste adds even more to that we have a program for a gradual reduction  government spendg based on these theories  I have a task force now that has been workg on where those cuts could be made I'm confident that it can be done  that it will reduce flation because I did it  California  flation went down below the national average  California when we returned money to the people  reduced government spendg President Carter Governor Reagan's proposal the Rigg Kim Roth proposal is one  the most highly flationary ideas it ever has been presented to the American public he would actually have to cut government spendg by at least a hundred  thirty billion dollars  order to balance  budget under this ridiculous proposal I noticed that his task force is workg for his future plans had some  their ideas revealed  the    this week one  those ideas was to repeal the mimum wage  several times this year governor Reagan has said that the major cause  unemployment is the mimum wage this is a heartless kd  approach to the workg families  our country which is typical  many an leaders  the past but I thk has been accentuated under governor Reagan  California I'm surprised governor Reagan brought this up he had the three largest tax creases  the history  that state under his admistration he more than doubled state spendg while he was governor 122 percent crease  had between a twenty  thirty percent crease  the number  employees sarahdan  California  thank you sir it's governor Reagan has the last word on this question yes the figures that the president has just used about California is a distortion  the situation there because while I was governor  California our spendg  California creased less per capita than the spendg  rgia while mr. Carter was governor  rgia  the same four years the size  government creased only onesixth  California  what it creased  proportion to population  rgia  the idea that my tax cut proposal is flationary I would like to ask the president why is it flationary to let the people keep more  their money  spend it the way they'd like  it isn't flationary to let him take that money  spend it the way he wants I wish that question need not be rhetorical but it must be because we run out  time on that now the the third question to Governor Reagan from William Hilliard yes governor Reagan the decle   our cities has been hastened by the contual rise  crime strange race relations to fall  the quality  public education the persistence  abnormal poverty  a rich nation  a decle  the services to the public the signs seem to pot toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment  a permanent underclass  the cities what specifically would you do  the next four years to reverse this trend I have been talkg to a number  congressmen who have much the same idea that I have  that is that  the ner city areas that  cooperation with local government  with national government  usg tax centives  wouldn't Kapil cooperation with the private sector but we have development zones let the local entity the city declare this particular area based on the stards  the percentage  people on welfare unemployed  so forth  that area  then through tax centives duce the creation  busesses providg jobs  so forth  those areas the elements  government through these tax centives for example a busess that would not have for a period  time an crease  the property tax reflectg its development  the unused property that it was makg wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't gettg any tax that now  it would simply be a delay  on the other h many  the people that would then be given jobs are presently Ward's  the government  it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax centive because they that wouldn't be costg government anythg either I thk there are thgs to do  this regard I stood  the South Bronx on the exact spot the President Carter stood on  1977 you have to see it to believe it it looks like a bombed out city great gaunt skeletons  buildgs wdows smashed out pated on one  them unkept promises on another despair  this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was gog to brg  a vast program to rebuild this department there are hope for this area there are whole blocks  l that are left bare just bulldoze down flat  nothg has been done  they are now chargg to take tourists through there to see this terrible desolation I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care  my family aga nothg has been done followup mr. Hilliard yes governor Reagan blacks  other nonwhites are creasg  numbers  our cities many  them feel that they are facg a hostility from whites that prevents them from jog the economic mastream  our society there is racial confrontation  the schools on jobs   housg is nonwhite seek to reap the benefits  a free society what do you thk is the nation's future as a multiracial society I believe  it I am eternally optimistic  I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young  when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem I know those thgs can grow out  despair  an ner city when there's hopelessness at at home lack  work  so forth but I believe that all  us together  I believe the presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was it's a bully pulpit  I thk that somethg can be done from there because the goal for all  us should be that one day thgs will be done neither because  nor  spite  any  the differences between us ethnic differences or racial justice differences whatever they may be that we will have total equal opportunity for all people  I would do everythg I could  my power to brg that about mr. Hilliard would you repeat your question for President Carter President Carter the decle  our cities has been hastened by the contual rise  crime straed race relations the fall  the quality  public education the persistence  abnormal poverty  a rich nation  a decle  services to the public the signs seem to pot toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment  a permanent underclass  the cities what specifically would you do  the next four years to reverse this trend Thank You mr. Yeo when I was campaigng  1976 everywhere I went the mayors  local ficials were  despair about the rapidly deterioratg central cities  our nation we itiated a very fe urban renewal program workg with the mayors the governors  other terested ficials this has been a very successful effort that's one  the ma reasons that we've had such an crease  a number  people employed other ne million people put to work  new jobs sce I've been  fice 1.3 million  those has been among black Americans  another million among those who speak Spanish we're now planng to contue the revitalization program with creased commitments  Rapid Transit mass transit under the wdfall prits tax we expect to spend about forty three billion dollars  the next ten years to rebuild a transportation systems  our country we also are pursug the housg programs we've had a 73% crease  the allotment  federal funds for improved education these are the kds  efforts worked on a jot basis with community leaders particularly  a mority areas  essential cities that had been deterioratg so  the past it's very important to us that this be done with the full volvement  mority citizens I brought to that level top levels  government to the white house to admistrative fices  the executive branch  it to the judicial system highly qualified black  Spanish citizens  women who  the past had been excluded I noticed that governor Reagan said it when he was a young a man that there was no knowledge  a racial problem  this country those who suffered from discrimation because  race or sex certaly knew we had a racial problem we have gone a long way toward correctg these problems but we still have a long way to go the followup question this President Carter liked me see repeat the same followup to you blacks  other nonwhites are creasg  numbers  our cities many  them feel that they are facg a hostility from whites that prevents them from jog the economic mastream  our society there is racial confrontation  the schools on jobs   housg is nonwhite seek to reap the benefits  a free society what is your assessment  the nation's as a future  multiracial society ours is a nation  refugees a nation  immigrants almost all  our citizens came here from other ls  now have hopes which are beg realized for a better life preservg their ethnic commitments they are family structures their religious beliefs preservg their relationships with their relatives  foreign countries but still filmg themselves together  a very coherent society which gives our nation  strength  the past those mority groups have ten been excluded from participation  the affairs  government sce I've been president I've appoted for stance more than twice as many black federal judges as all previous presidents  the history  this country I've done the same thg  the appotment  women's  also spanishspeakg Americans to volve them  admistration  government  a feelg that they belong to this sanal structure that makes decisions  the judiciary  an executive branch is a very important commitment which I am tryg to realize  contue to do so  the future governor Reagan you have a mute for rebuttal yes the president talks  government programs  they have their place but as governor when I was at that end  the le  receivg some  these grants for government programs I saw that so many  them were dead end they were public employment for these people who really want to get out to the private job market where there are jobs with a future now the president spoke a moment ago about that I was agast the mimum wage I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group  teenagers who were black  who were tellg me about their unemployment problems  that it was the mimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get  deed every time it is creased you will fd that there was an crease  mority unemployment among young people  therefore I have been  favor  a separate mimum for them with regard to the great progress that has been made with his government spendg the rate  black unemployment  Detroit Michigan is 56 percent President Carter you have the last word on this question well it's obviously we still have a long way to go  fully corporatg the mority groups to the mastream  American life we have made good progress  there's no doubt  my md that the commitment to unemployment compensation the mimum wage welfare national health surance those kds  commitments that have typify the Democratic Party sce ancient history  this country's political life are a very important element  the future  all those elements Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out agast them which to me shows a very great sensitivity to givg deprive families a better chance  life this to me is a very important difference between him  me  this election  I believe the American people will judge accordgly there is no doubt  my md that  the downtown central cities with the with the new commit on an energy policy with a chance to revitalize homes  to make them more fuel efficient with a chance for synthetic synthetic fuels program solar power this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends thank you gentlemen now for the fourth question to President Carter from Barbara Walters mr. president the eyes  the country tonight are on the hostages  Iran I realize this is a sensitive area but the question  how we respond to acts  terrorism goes beyond this current crisis other countries have policies that determe how they will respond Israel for example considers hostages like soldiers  will not negotiate with terrorists for the future mr. president the country has the right to know do you have a policy for dealg with terrorism wherever it might happen  what have we learned from this experience  Iran that might cause us to do thgs differently if this was somethg similar happens aga probably one  the blights on this world is a threat  the activities  terrorists at one  the recent economic summit conferences between myself  the other leaders  the Western world we committed ourselves to take strong action agast terrorism airplane hijackg was one  the elements  that commitment there is no doubt that we have seen  recent years  recent months additional acts  violence agast Jews  France   course agast those who live  Israel by the PLO  other terrorist organizations ultimately the most serious terrorist threat is if one  those radical nations who believe  terrorism  a policy should have atomic weapons both I  all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controllg the proliferation  nuclear weapons  countries like Libya or Iraq we have even a donated some  our closest trade partners because we have sisted upon the control  the spread  nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries when Governor Reagan has been askg then he makes a very disturbg comment that nonproliferation or the control  the spread  nuclear weapons is none  our busess  when he was asked specifically recently about Iraq he said there's nothg we can do about it this ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome  all  it's part  a pattern where our country must st firm to control terrorism  all kds ms walters followup yes while we are discussg policy header an not taken American hostages I assume that  order to preserve our neutrality we would have stopped the flow  spare parts  vital war materials once war broke out between Iraq  Iran now we are free to lift the ban on such Goods if they let our people come home doesn't this reward tourism compromise our neutrality  possibly antagonize nations now friendly to us  the Middle East we will mata our position  neutrality  the Iran  Iraq war we have no plans to sell additional material or goods to Iran that might be  a warlike nature when I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result  a takg  our hostages I then  have consistently mataed sce then that if the hostages are released safely that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns which they have bought  paid for also that the frozen Iranian assets would be released that's been a consistent policy one I tend to carry out but you repeat the question now for governor Reagan please miss Walters yes governor the eyes  the country tonight rema on the hostages  Iran but the question  how we respond to acts  terrorism goes beyond this current crisis there are other countries that have policies that determe how they will respond Israel for example considers hostages like soldiers  will not negotiate with terrorists for the future the country has the right to know do you have a policy for dealg with terrorism wherever it might happen  what have we learned from this experience  Iran that might cause us to do thgs differently if this was somethg similar should happen aga Barbara you there's that question twice I thk you ought to have at least one answer to it I am I have been accused  lately  havg a secret plan with regard to the hostages now this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times durg this campaign to the press which is that the question would be have you any ideas  what you would do if you were there  I said well yes  I thk that anyone that's seekg this position as well as other people probably have thought to themselves what about this what about that these are just ideas  what I would thk  if I were  that position  had access to the formation  which I would know all the options that were open to me I have never answered the question however second the one that says well tell me what are some  those ideas first  all I would be fearful that I might say somethg that was presently under way or  negotiations  thus expose it  endanger the hostages  sometimes I thk some  my ideas might volve quiet diplomacy where you don't say  advance or say to anyone what it is you're thkg  dog your question is difficult to answer because  the situation right now no one wants to say anythg that would advertently delay  any way the return  those hostages if they're if there is a chance  their comg home soon or that might cause them harm what I do thk should be done once they are safely here with their families  that tragedy is over  we've endured this humiliation for just lackg one week  a year now then I thk it is time for us to have a complete vestigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made  the begng why they have been there so long  when they come home what did we have to do  order to brg that about what arrangements were made  I would suggest that Congress should hold such an vestigation  the meantime I'm gog to contue prayg they'll come home followup question I would like to say that neither cidate answered specifically the question  a specific policy for dealg with terrorism but I will ask governor Reagan a different to followup question you've had suggested that there would be no Iranian crisis had you been president because we would have given firmer support to the Shah but around is a country  37 million people who are resistg a government they regarded as dictatorial my question is not whether the Shahs regime was preferable to the ayatollahs but whether the United States has the power or the right to try to determe what form  government any country will have  do we back unpopular regimes whose major merit is that they are friendly to the United States the degree  unpopularity  a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism I should say  the alternative government makes one wonder whether you are beg helpful to the people  we've been guilty  that because someone didn't meet exactly our stards  human rights even though they were an ally  ours stead  tryg patiently to persuade them to change their ways we have  a number  stances aided a revolutionary overthrow which results  complete totalitarianism stead for those people  I thk that this is a kd  a hypocritical policy when at the same time we are matag a date on with the one nation  the world where there are no human rights at all the Soviet Union now there was a second phase  the Iranian affair  which we had somethg to do with that  that was we had adequate warng that there was a threat to our embassy  we could have done what other embassies did either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel before the kidnap  the takeover took place the other one I'm sorry I must terrupt President Carter you have a mute for rebuttal I didn't hear any comment from governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism  the future what the Western lies did decide to do is to stop all air flights commercial air flights to any nation volved  terrorism or the hijackg  airplanes  the harborg  high jackers secondly we all committed ourselves as have all my predecessors  the Oval Office not to permit the spread  nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives third not to make any sales  material or weapons to a nation which is volved  terrorist activities  lastly not to deal with the PLO until  unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist  recognizes UN resolution 22 as a basis for Middle East peace these are a few  the thgs to which our nation is committed  we will contue with these commitments Governor Reagan you have the last word on that question yes I have no quarrel whatsoever with the thgs that have been done because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries  the world made it pla that there is no room worldwide for terrorism there will be no negotiation with terrorists  any kd  while I have a last word here I would like to correct a misstatement  fact by the president's I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation  nuclear proliferation or the tryg to halt it would be a major part  a foreign policy  me thank you gentlemen that is the first half  the debate now the rules for the second half quite simple they're only complicated when I expla them the second half the panel is with me we'll have no followup questions stead after the panelists have asked a question the cidates have answered each  the cidates will have two opportunities to follow up to question to rebut or just a comment on his opponent statement governor Reagan will respond  this section to the first question from Marv stone governor Reagan arms control the president said it was the sgle most important issue both  you who have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms race with Russia but by methods that are vastly different you suggest that we scrap the salt 2 treaty already negotiated  tensify the buildup  American power  to duce the Soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to us yes President Carter on the other h says he will aga a try to convce a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty  the grounds it's the best we can hope to get now both  you cannot be right will you tell us why you thk you are yes I thk I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy a strong America  a strong economy  then as we build up our national security to restore our marg  safety we at the same time try to restra the Soviet buildup which has been gog forward a rapid pace  for quite some time the salt 2 treaty was the result  negotiations  mr. Carter's team entered to after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion  actual reduction  nuclear strategic weapons  his emissary I thk came home  12 hours with havg heard a very defite net but takg that one no from the Soviet Union we then went back to negotiations on their terms because mister Carter had canceled the b1 bomber delayed the MX delayed the Trident submare delayed the cruise missile shut down the missile man the three the Muteman missile production le  whatever other thgs that might have been done the Soviet Union sat at the table knowg that we had gone forward with unilateral considerate concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever now I have not blocked the salt ii treaty as carter mr. Mondale suggests that I have it has been blocked by a Senate  which there is a Democratic majority deed the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0 with 7 abstentions agast the salt 2 treaty  declared that it was not  the national security terests  the United States besides which it is illegal because the law  the l passed by Congress says we cannot accept a treaty  which we are not equal  we're not equal  this treaty for one reason alone our b52 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons their backfire bombers are not the governor I have to terrupt you at that pot the time's up for that but the same question now to President Carter yes President Carter both  you have expressed the desire to end the nuclear arms wave race with Russia but through vastly different methods the governor suggests we scrap the salt 2 treaty which you negotiated  Vienna are signed  Vienna  tensify the buildup  American power to duce the Soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to us you on the other h say you will aga try to convce a reluctant Congress to ratify the present treaty on the grounds it is the best we can hope to get from the Russians you cannot both be right will you tell us why you thk you are yes I'd be glad to flation unemployment the cities all very important issues but they pale to significance  the life  duties  a president when compared with the control  nuclear weapons every president who has served  the Oval Office sce Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition  controllg nuclear weapons to negotiate with the Soviet Union balanced controlled observable  then reducg levels  atomic weaponry there is a disturbg pattern  the attitude  Governor Reagan he has never supported any  those arms control agreements the limited test ban salt one nor that the the antiballistic missile treaty nor the Vladivostok treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford  now he wants to throw to the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced  equal basis between ourselves  the Soviet Union over a sevenyear period by myself  my two an predecessors the Senate has not voted yet on the strategic arms limitation treaty there have been prelimary skirmishg x'  the Committees  the Senate but the treaty has never come to the floor  the Senate for either a debate or a vote it's understable that a senator  the prelimary debate can make an irresponsible statement or maybe an illadvised statement you've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake if it is a mistake but when a man who hopes to be president says take this treaty discard it do not vote do not debate do not explore the issues do not fally capitalize on this law negotiation that is a very dangerous  disturbg thg governor Reagan you have an opportunity to rebut that yes I'd like to respond very much first  all the Soviet Union if I have been critical  some  the previous agreements is because we've been out negotiated for quite a long time  they have managed  spite  all  our attempts at arms limitation to to go forward with the biggest military buildup  the history  man now to suggest that because two an presidents tried to pass the sole Trudy treaty that puts them on its side I would like to say a president Ford who was with 90 percent  an a tree  treaty that we could be  agreement with when he left fice is emphatically agast this salt treaty I would like to pot out also that senators like Henry Jackson  Hollgs  South Carola they are takg the lead  the fight agast this particular treaty I am NOT talkg  scrappg I am talkg  takg the treaty back  gog back to negotiations  I would say to the Soviet Union we will sit  negotiate with you as long as it takes to have not only legitimate arms limitation but to have a reduction  these nuclear weapons to the pot that neither one  us represents a threat to the other that is hardly throwg away a treaty  beg opposed to arms limitation President Carter yes governor Reagan is makg some very misleadg  disturbg statements he not only advocates the scrappg  his treaty  I don't know that these men as he quotes or agast the treaty  his fal form but he also advocates the possibility he said it's been a missg element  playg a trump card agast the Soviet Union  a nuclear arms race  sistg upon nuclear superiority by our own nation as a predication for negotiation  the future with the Soviet Union if president Brezhnev said we will scrap this treaty negotiated under three American presidents over a sevenyear period  time we sist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations  we believe that the launchg  a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations it's obvious that I as president  all Americans would reject such a proposition this would mean the resumption  a very dangerous nuclear arms race it would be very disturbg to American people it would change the basic tone  commitment that our nation has experienced ever sce the Second  War with all presidents Democratic  an  would also be very disturbg to our allies all  whom support this nuclear arms treaty  addition  that the adversarial relationship between ourselves  the Soviet Union would undoubtedly terior eight very rapidly this attitude is extremely dangerous  belligerent  his tone although it's said with a quiet voice Governor Reagan I know the president's supposed to be replyg to me but sometimes I have a hard time  connectg what he's sayg with what I have said or what my positions are sometimes thk it's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure little work the my pot I have made already mr. president with regard to negotiatg it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part  the United States it is calls for a mutual reduction  these weapons as I say to the pot that neither  us can represent a threat to the other  to suggest that the salt to treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a contuation  based on all  the precedg efforts by two previous presidents is just not true it was a new negotiation because as I say President Ford was with about 10%  havg a solution that could be acceptable  I thk our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair  verifiable salt agreement President Carter you have the last word on this question I thk to close out this discussion it would be better to put to perspective what we're talkg about I had a discussion with my daughter Amy the other day before I came here to ask you what the most important issue was she said she thought nuclear weaponry city  the control  nuclear arms this is a formidable force some  these weapons have 10 megatons  explosion if you put 50 tons  TNT  each one  railroad cars you would have a car load  TNT a traload  TNT stretchg across this nation that's one major war explosion  a warhead we have thouss equivalent  Megaton or million tons  TNT warheads the control  these weapons is the sgle major responsibility  a president  to cast down this commitment  all presidents because  some slight technicalities it can be corrected is a very dangerous approach we have to go to another question now from Harry Ellis to President Carter mr. president as you have said Americans through conservation are importg much less oil today than we were even a year ago yet u.s. dependence on Arab oil as a percentage  total imports is today much higher than it at the time  the 1973 Arab oil embargo  for some time to come the loss  substantial amounts  Arab oil could plunge the u.s. to depression now this means that a bridge must be built out  this dependence can the United States develop synthetic fuels  other alternative energy sources without damage to the environment  will this process mean steadily higher fuel bills for American families I don't thk is it  doubt that  the future the cost  oil is gog to go up what I've had is a basic commitment sce I've been as president is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil it can only be done  two ways one to conserve energy to stop the waste  energy  secondly to produce more American energy we've been very successful  both cases we've now reduced the importg  foreign oil  the last year alone by onethird we imported today 2 million barrels  oil less than we did the same day just a year ago this commitment has been openg up a very bright Vista for our nation  the future because with the wdfall prits tax as a base we now have an opportunity to use American technology an American ability an American natural resources to exp rapidly the production  synthetic fuels yes to exp rapidly the production  solar energy yes  also to produce a conventional kds  American energy we will drill more oil  gas wells this year than any year  history will produce more coal this year than any year  history we are exportg more coal this year than any year  history  we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems improved loadg facilities  our ports to see a very good opportunity on a world ternational market to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source this excitg future will not only give us more energy security but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life  to have Milly  new jobs associated with this new  very dynamic dustry now  prospect because  the new energy policy that we put to effect would you repeat the question now for governor Reagan governor Reagan Americans through conservation are importg much less oil today than we were even a year ago  yet us reliance on Arab oil as a percentage  total imports is much higher today than it was durg the 1973 Arab oil embargo  the substantial loss  Arab oil could plunge the United States to depression the question is whether the development  alternative energy sources  order to reduce this dependence can be done without damagg the environment  will it mean for American families steadily higher fuel bills I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as beg energy poor when it is energy rich the coal that the president mentioned yes we have it  yet oneeighth  our total coal resources is not beg utilized at all right now the mes are closed down there are 22,000 mers out  work most  this is due to regulations which either terfere with the mg  it or prevent the burng  it with our modern technology yes we can burn our coal with the limits  the Clean Air Act I thk as technology improves we'll be able to do even better with that the other thg is that we have only leased out  begun to explore 2%  our outer contental shelf for oil where it is believed by everyone familiar with that fuel  that source  energy that there are vast supplies yet to be found our government has  the last year or so taken out  multiple use millions  acres  public ls that once were while there were public ls subject to multiple use exploration for merals  so forth it is believed that probably percent  the potential oil  the United States is probably hidden  those ls  no one is allowed to even go  explore to fd out  it is there this is particularly true  the recent efforts to shut down part  aska nuclear power there were 36 power plants planned  this country  let me add the word safety it must be done with the utmost  safety but 32  those have given up  canceled their plans to build  aga because government regulations  permits  so forth take make it take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant  the United States as it does to build one  Japan or  Western Europe we have the sources here we are energy rich  coal is one  the great potentials we have President Carter your comment yes sir to repeat myself we have this year the opportunity which will realize to produce 800 million tons  coal an unequaled record  the history  our country governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement  he blames restrats on coal production on regulations regulations that affect the life  the health  safety  mers  also regulations that protect the purity  our air  the quality  our water  our l we cannot cast aside those regulations we have a chance  the next 15 years sistg upon the health  safety  workers  the mes  also preservg the same high air  water pollution stards to triple the amount  coal we produce Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy which is already proven its effectiveness is to repeal or to change substantially the wdfall prits tax to return a major portion  227 billion dollars back to the oil companies to do away with the Department  Energy to shortcircuit our synthetic fuels program to put a mimal mm emphasis on solar power to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source  energy  the future he wants to put all our eggs  one basket  give that basket to the major oil companies governor Reagan that is a misstatement  course  my position I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job producg the thgs that people need then government can the Department  Energy has a multibillion dollar budget  excess  ten billion dollars it hasn't produced a quart  oil or a lump  coal or anythg else  the le  energy  for the mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws  with the laws that perta to clean water  clean air  so forth as governor  California I took charge  passg the strictest air pollution laws  the United States the strictest air quality law that has ever been adopted  the United States  we created an OSHA an occupational safety  health agency for the protection  employees before the federal government had one  place  to this day not one  its decisions or rulgs has ever been challenged so I thk some  those charges are missg the pot I am suggestg that there are literally thouss  unnecessary regulations that vade every facet  busess  deed very much  our personal lives that are unnecessary that government can do without that it added 130 billion dollars to the cost  production  this country  that are contributg their part to flation  I would like to see us a little more free as we once were President Carter another crack at that sure as a matter  fact the air pollution stard laws that were passed  California were passed over the objections  Governor Reagan  this is a very wellknown fact also recently when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety  Health Act should be abolished governor Reagan responded amen the fshore drillg rights is a question that governor Reagan raises ten as a matter  fact  the proposal for the aska ls legislation a hundred percent  all the fshore ls would be open for exploration  netyfive percent  all the aska ls where it is suspected or believe that meral merals might exist we have with our fiveyear plan for the leasg  fshore ls proposed more l to be drilled than has been opened up for drillg sce this program first started  195 so we are not puttg restrats on American exploration we're encouragg it  every way we can governor Reagan you have the last word on this question yes if it is a wellknown fact that I opposed air pollution laws  California the only thg I can possibly thk  is that the President must be suggestg the law that the federal government tried to impose on the state  California not a law regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile with the city limits  any California city or have a place to put it if you did drive it agast their regulations it would have destroyed the economy  California  I must say we had the support  Congress when we poted out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency we still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws  the country as for fshore oil only 2% now is so leased  is producg oil the the rest as to whether the open the ls are gog to be opened  the next five years or so we're already five years behd  what we should be dog there is more oil now  the wells that have been drilled than has been taken out  120 years one years that they've been drilled Thank You governor Thank You mr. president the next question goes to governor Reagan from William Hilliard governor Reagan wage earners  this country especially the young are supportg a social security system that contues to affect their come drastically the system is fosterg a struggle between the young  the oil  is driftg the country toward a polarization  these two groups how much longer can the young wageearner expect to bear the evercreasg burden  the Social Security system the Social Security system was based on a false premise with regard to how fast the number  workers would crease  how fast the number  retirees would crease it is actually out  balance  this first became evident about 16 years ago  some  us were voicg warngs then now it is trillions  dollars out  balance  the only answer that has come so far is the biggest sgle tax crease  our nation's history the payroll tax crease for Social Security which will only put a baid on this  postpone the day  reckong by a few years at most what is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force to look  experts to look to this entire problem as to how it can be reformed  made actuarially sound but with the premise that no one presently depended on Social Security is gog to have the rug pulled out from under them  not get their check we cannot frighten as we have with the threats  the campaign rhetoric that is gog on  this campaign our senior citizens leave them thkg that  some way they're endangered  they would have no place to turn they must contue to get those checks  I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis but it's gog to take some study  some work  not just passg a tax crease to let the load or the ro fall  on the next admistration would you repeat that question for President Carter yes President Carter wage earners  this country especially the young are supportg a Social Security system that contues to affect their come drastically the system is fosterg a struggle between young  old  is driftg the country toward a polarization  these two groups how much longer can the young wage earner expect to bear the evercreasg burden  the Social Security system as long as as a Democratic president  the White House we will have a strong  viable Social Security system free  the threat  bankruptcy although governor Reagan has changed his position lately on four different occasions he has advocated makg Social Security a voluntary system which would  effect very quickly bankrupt it I noticed also  the    earlier this week that a prelimary report  his task force advocates makg Social Security more sound by reducg the adjustments  Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact  flation these kds  approaches are very dangerous to the security  the wellbeg  a peace  md  the retired people  this country  those approachg retirement age but no matter what it takes  the future to keep Social Security sound it must be kept that way  although there was a serious threat to the Social Security system  its tegrity durg the 1976 campaign  when I became president the action  the Democratic Congress workg with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound fancial basis that's a way it will stay  Governor Reagan well that just isn't true it is I said delayed the actuarial imbalance fallg on us for just a few years with that crease  taxes  I don't believe we can go on creasg the tax because the problem for the young people today is that they're payg  far more than they can ever expect to get out now aga this statement that somehow I wanted to destroy it  I just changed my tune that I was for voluntary Social Security which would mean the ru  it mr. president the voluntary thg that I suggested many years ago was that a young man orphaned  raised by an aunt who died his aunt was eligible for Social Security surance because she was not his mother  I suggested that if this is an surance program certaly the person who's payg  should be able to name his own beneficiaries  that's the closest I've ever come do anythg voluntary with Social Security I to  pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens  ours they're gog to contue to get their money there are some changes I'd like to make I would like to make a change that discrimates  the regulations agast a wife who works  fds that she then is faced with a choice between her father or her husb's benefits if he dies first or what she is paid  but it does not recognize that she has also been payg  herself  she is entitled to more  she presently can get I'd like to change that President Carter's rebuttal now right these constant suggestions that the basic Social Security system should be changed does cause concern  consternation among the agent  our country it's obvious that we should have a commitment to them that Social Security benefits should not be taxed  that that would be no peremptory change  the stards by which Social Security payments are made to the retired people we also need to contue to dex the Social Security payments so that if flation Rises the Social Security payments would rise  degree to let the buyg power  the Social Security check contue tact  the past the relationship between Social Security  Medicare has been very important to provide some modicum  aid for senior citizens  the retention  health benefits Governor Reagan as a matter  fact began his political career campaigng around this nation agast Medicare now we have an opportunity to move toward national health surance with an emphasis on the prevention  disease an emphasis on outpatient care not patient care an emphasis on Hospital cost contament to hold down the cost  hospital care for those who are ill  emphasis own catastrophic health surance so that if a family is threatened with beg wiped out economically because the very  a very high medical bill then the surance would help pay for it these are the kd   a national health surance important to the American people governor Reagan aga typically is agast such a proposal governor now you go aga when I opposed Medicare there was another piece  legislation meang the same problem before the Congress I happen to favor the other piece  legislation  thought that it would be better for the senior citizens  provide better care than the one that was fally passed I was not opposg the prciple  providg care for them I was opposg one piece  legislation as versus another there is somethg else about Social Security course that doesn't come out  the payroll tax it comes out  the general fund that somethg should be done about I thk it's disgraceful that the disability surance fund  Social Security fds checks gog every month to tens  thouss  people who are locked up  our stitutions for crime or from mental illness  they are receivg disability checks from Social Security every month while a state stitution provides for all  their needs  their care President Carter you have the last word on this question I thk there's debate on Social Security Medicare national health surance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party  the an Party the allusions to basic changes  the mimum wage is another  the deleterious comments that the governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation these commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the workg families  this nation have been extremely important to the growth  their stature   a better quality  life for them I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents  his acceptance address  other words I have never heard a cidate for president who is a an quote a an president but when they get  fice they try to govern like ans so it's good for the American people to remember that is a sharp basic historical difference between governor Reagan  me on these crucial issues also between the two parties that we represent Thank You mr. president governor Reagan we now go to another question question to President Carter by Barbara Walters thank you you have addressed some  the major issues tonight but the biggest issue  the mds  American voters is yourselves your ability to lead this country when many voters go to that booth just a week from today they will be votg their gut stct about you men you've already given us your reasons why people should vote for you now would you please tell us for this your fal question why they should not vote for your opponent why his presidency could be harmful to the nation  have been examed both your opponent's record  the man himself tell us his greatest weakness Robert reluctant as i understg critical about governor Reagan I'll try to answer your question first  all is the historical perspective that I've just described this is a contest between a Democrat  the mastream  my party as exemplified by the actions that have taken  the Oval Office the last four years as contrasted with Governor Reagan who  most cases does typify his Prada but  some cases there is a radical departure by him from the heritage  Eisenhower  others the most important crucial difference  this election campaign  my judgment is the approach to the control  nuclear weaponry  the clation to control or not to control the spread  atomic weapons to other nations that don't presently have it predicted the terrorist ions the clation the Governor Reagan has exemplified  many troubled times sce he's been runng for presidents I thk sce 1968 to ject American military forces  places like North Korea to put a blockade around Cuba this year or  some stances to project American forces to a fishg dispute agast the small nation  Ecuador on the west coast  South America this is typical  his longstg clation on the use  American power not to resolve disputes diplomatically  peacefully but to show that the exercise  military power is best proven by the actual use  it obviously no president wants war  I certaly did not believe the Governor Reagan if he were president would want war but a president  the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power  our country for peace through diplomacy or  a careless way  a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes  the past Barbara would you repeat the question for Governor Reagan thank you realizg that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill  your opponent may I ask why people should not vote for your opponent why his presidency could be harmful to the nation  havg examed both your opponent's record  the man himself could you tell us his greatest weakness Oh Barbara I believe that there is a fundamental difference  I thk it has been evident  most  the answers that mr. Carter's given tonight that he seeks the solution to anythg as another opportunity for a federal government program I happen to believe that the federal government has usurped powers  autonomy autonomy  authority that belongs back at the state  local level it has imposed on the dividual freedoms  the people  that there are more  these thgs that could be solved by the people themselves if they were given a chance or by the levels  government that were closer to them now as to why I should be  he shouldn't be when he was a cidate  1976 President Carter vented a thg he called the misery dex he added the rate  unemployment  the rate  flation  it came at that time to 12.5 under President Ford  he said that no man with that size misery dex had a right to seek reelection to the presidency today by his own decision leave misery dex is an excess  20%  I thk this must suggest somethg but when I have quoted a Democrat president as the president says I was a Democrat I said many foolish thgs back  those days but the president that I quoted had made a promise a Democrat promised  I quoted him because it was never kept  today you would fd that that promise is at the very heart  what republicanism represents  this country today  that's why I believe they're gog to be millions  Democrats that are gog to vote with us this time around because they too want that promise kept it was a promise for less government  less taxes  more freedom for the people President Carter yes I mentioned the radical departure  governor Reagan from the prciples or ideals or historical perspective  his own party I don't thk this can be better Illustrated than  the case with guaranteeg women equal rights under the Constitution  our nation for 0 years the an Party platforms call for guaranteeg women equal rights with a constitutional amendment six predecessors  me who served  Oval Office call for this guarantee  women's rights governor Reagan  the new an Party has departed from this commitment a very severe blow to the opportunity for women fally to correct discrimation under which they have suffered when a man  a woman do the same amount  work a man gets paid a dollar a woman only gets paid 59 cents  the Equal Rights Amendment only says that equality  rights shall not be abridged for women by the federal government or by the state government that's all it says a simple guarantee  equality  opportunity which typifies the Democratic Party  which is a very important commitment  md as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the longstg policies  his own party Governor Reagan yes mr. president once aga I happen to be agast the amendment because I thk the amendment will take this problem out  the hs  elected legislators  put it  the hs  unelected judges I am for equal rights  while you have been  fice for four years  not one sgle state  most  them have a majority  Democratic legislators has added to the ratification or voted to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment while I was governor more than eight years ago I found 1 separate stances where women were discrimated agast  the body  California law  I had passed  signed to law 1 statutes that elimated those discrimations cludg the economic ones that you have just mentioned equal pay  so forth I believe that if  all these years that we've spent tryg to get the amendment that we'd spent as much time correctg these laws as we did  California  we were the first to do it if I were president I would also now take a look at the hundreds  federal regulations which discrimate agast women  which go right on while everyone is lookg for an amendment I would have someone ride herd  those regulations  we'd start elimatg those discrimations  the federal government agast women president correa yes Howard I'm a southerner  I share the basic beliefs  my region about an excessive government trusion to the private affairs  American citizens  also to the private affairs  the free enterprise system one  the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major dustries  this country we've been remarkably successful with the help  the Democratic Congress we deregulated the air dustry the rail dustry the truckg dustry fancial stitutions now workg on the communications dustry  addition to that I believe this element  discrimation is somethg that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region  the country which has now been corrected not only racial discrimation but discrimation agast people that have to work for a livg because we have been tryg to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps sce the long Depression years  lead a full  useful life  the affairs  this country we've made remarkable success it's part  my consciousness  my commitment to contue this progress so my heritage as a southerner my experience  the Oval Office convces me that what I've just described is a proper course for the future governor Reagan yours is the last word well my last word is aga to say that this we were talkg about this very simple amendment  women's rights  I make it a pla aga I am for women's rights but I would like to call the attention  the people  the fact that that's socalled simple amendment could be used by mischievous men to destroy discrimations that properly belong by law to women respectg the physical differences between the two sexes labor laws that protect them agast dog thgs that would be physically harmful to them those would all could all be challenged by men  the same would be true with regard to combat service  the military  so forth I thought there was a subject we were supposed to be on but if we're talkg about how much we thk about the workg people  so forth I'm the only fella that ever ran for this job who was six times president  his own Union  still has a lifetime membership  that Union gentlemen each  you now have three mutes for a closg statement President Carter you'll first first  all I'd like to thank illegal League  Women Voters for makg this debate possible I thk it's been a very constructive debate  I hope it's helped to acquat the American people with the sharp differences between myself  governor Reagan also I want to thank the people  Clevel  Ohio for beg such hospitable hosts durg this last few hours  my life I've been present now for almost four years I've had to make thouss  decisions  each one  those decisions has been a learng process I've seen the strength  my nation  I've seen the crises that it approached  a tentative way  I've had to deal with those crises as best I could as I've studied the record between myself  governor Reagan I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us I thk the result  this debate dicate that that fact is true I consider myself  the mastream  my party I consider myself  the means mastream even  the bipartisan list  presidents who served before me the United States must be a nation strong the United States must be a nation secure we must have a society that's just  fair  we must extend the benefits  our own commitment to peace to create a peaceful world I believe that sce I've been  fice there have been six or eight areas  combat Evolved  other parts  the world  each case I alone have had to determe the terest  my country  the degree  volvement  my country I've done that with moderation with care with thoughtfulness sometimes consultg experts but I've learned  this last threeahalf years that when an issue is extremely difficult when the call is very close the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50/50  the fal judgement about the future  a nation war peace volvement reticence thoughtfulness care consideration concern has to be made by the men  the Oval Office it's a lonely job but with the volvement  the American people  the process with an open government the job is a very gratifyg one the American people now facg next Tuesday a lonely decision those listeng to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future  this country  I thk they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot  difference if one vote per precct had changed  1960 John Kennedy would never have been president  his nation  if a few more people had gone to the polls  voted  1968 Hubert Humphrey would have been press richard nixon would not there is a partnership volved  our nation to stay strong to stay at peace to raise how the banner  human rights to set an example for the rest  the world to let our deep beliefs  commitments be felt by others  all the nations is my plan for the future I ask the American people to jo me  this partnership Governor Reagan because I would like to add my words  thanks too to the ladies  the  the League  Women Voters for makg these debates possible I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the brgg   the third cidate so that he could have been seen also  these debates but still it's good that at least once all three  us were heard by the people  this country next Tuesday is election day next Tuesday all  you will go to the polls who st there  the pollg place  make a decision I thk when you make that decision it might be well if you would ask yourself are you better f than you were four years ago is it easier for you to go  buy thgs  the stores than it was four years ago is there more or less unemployment  the country than there was four years ago is America as respected throughout the world as it was do you feel that our security is as safe that we're as strong as we were four years ago  if you answer all  those questions yes why then I thk your choice is very obvious so who you'll vote for if you don't agree if you don't thk that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow over the next four then I could suggest another choice that you have this country doesn't have to be  the shape that it is  we do not have to go down go on sharg  scarcity with the country gettg worse f with unemployment growg we talk about the unemployment les if all  the unemployed today were  a sgle le allowg two feet for each one  them that le would reach from New York City to Los Angeles California all  this can be cured  all  it can be solved I have not had the experience that the president has had  holdg that fice but I thk  beg governor  California the most populous state  the Union if it were a nation it would be the seventh rankg economic power  the world I too had some lonely moments  decisions to make I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation  the next few years can resolve many  the problems that trouble us today I know because we did it there we cut the cost the creased cost  government the crease  half over the eight years we returned 5.7 billion dollars  tax rebates credits  cuts to our people we as I said earlier fell below the national average  flation when we did that  I know that we did give back authority  autonomy to the people I would like to have a crusade today  I would like to lead that crusade with your help  it would be one to take government f the backs  the great people  this country  turn you loose aga to do those thgs that I know you can do so well because you did them  made this country great thank you gentlemen ladies  gentlemen for 60 years the League  Women Voters has been committed to citizen education  effective participation  Americans  governmental  political affairs the most critical element  all  that process is an formed citizen who goes to the polls  who votes on behalf  the League  Women Voters now I would like to thank President Carter  governor Reagan you"

book up every page reads like one  the best op eds you've you've ever read it is so well put together so thank you  I do thk you'll enjoy your time here  the next many mutes pressor I I wanted to start by readg three les from an early page  your book that I hope you recognize I bet you will  ask to see if you might exp on it because it's a perhaps  potentially really frighteng concept you say quote without their overwhelmg fealty or barrg another transformative Reagan cidate neither Trump nor any other contemporary an cidate will likely aga fd a pathway to the presidency yeah expla well at a time that stick the Obama admistration the an Party at the state  local level picked up about almost 1,100 fices  yet  five out  the six last national elections it lost the popular vote it hasn't won 51 percent  the popular vote sce Lee Atwater you remember the Boston Harbor ad the tank add all  that aga at least some  us do controlled enough agast Mike Dukakis so there was somethg missg there  the an message at the presidential level  I thk part  it was that two thgs very quickly one there became a mdset that we didn't want to be called certa names racist sexist homophobic esporte whatever it was  so we thought by playg by the marcus  Queensbury rules that that magnum entity would be reciprocated  kd when  fact it was considered weakness to be exploited or condemned or pitied  so we didn't really  I'm thkg here  george w bush who was just treated terribly between 2007  8 nazi brown shirt  didn't respond  so i thk people felt there were two thgs one way they wanted somebody who would respond they felt that even if Trump was chemotherapy at least he'd kill the cancer before you with the host  the second thg was that the message they felt that you just don't you just don't write f the terior  the United States  say it's dedustrialized or their deplorable so they're cleaners are their wacko Birds or their crazies that these are noble people  that  that  you don't say that 's predetermed to run the world when one American we have onethird that the population   still have we have roughly three times the GDP  blunt terms one American produces goods  services  the equivalent  three Chese counterparts  yet we're told all the time    you can't do this you can't do this so there were a lot  thgs that had to be talked about  a way that Trump did  yet that message was a very focused on the key states where the election was gog to be decided Wiscons Michigan Pennsylvania  I don't know if anybody everybody said Trump was the only cidate that could lose to Hillary I thk he was probably the only an cidate that could have won  he'll he might have been the only two that they could have lost but [] make America great aga I don't know how many had a chance to look at these slides as they rotated before the event began but there were several that were campaign posters  buttons  thgs from Ronald Reagan's campaign  1980 you know  which Ronald Reagan said  strongly advertised let's make America great aga now knowg that my sense is the what the media is dog is they're viewg whether it's the Hat  a statement or whatever that this is president Trump's way  wantg to take America back to the 1950s pre Civil Rights premi to free women's rights pre all those thgs  that that's essentially what one ought to read to those four letters or four words is that your view is that the way you thk this is playg itself out  is that your view where you thk Donald Trump wants to take the country I don't thk he wants to take it back to the precivil other you're you're confirmed with exria Ocasio Cortez at just that that Ronald Reagan was a racist not very long ago as well as FDR no I thk that what he's tryg to say let's make America great is  the narrowest sense there's no reason why the United States had should have not achieve annualized GDP  3% sce 2006  why why can't we have a record low mority unemployment  record P stood near three pot seven three pot eight we're almost record peacetime unemployment  who says that we that there is such a thg as peak oil  perhaps maybe we can add three million barrels  oil production sce he's so there was no artificially imposed politically clear limits  then he looked at a time where he fell that this country when Reagan was governor was about so I don't like to use those term because we're all mixed up  many families they don't really mean it very much unless you're Elizabeth Ward  you have a DNA test but we were about 90 percent socalled white  then maybe twelve ten percent socalled africanamerican  Lato but  every culture that has a domant population there's problems there is an Iraq there's a one what was unique about the United States that was baked to our foundg that all men are created equal so you had a constant process  self correction  selfcriticism  we were evolvg to what had happened with the Italian experience where Italians came they were mostly democratic  today if her name is Giuliani or Pelosi you don't know what your why your ethnic cachet you can't tell that was the goal  I thk we were workg toward that  so when what Trump says that I thk he thks that race or ethnicity should be cidental not essential to your persona but what's happened that almost everythg is politicized  ethnic or identity politics term that the immigration has now become a demographic Club to beat the opposition with  that we're supposed to selfidentify as as I'm a I'm a Lato I'm gay I'm this I'm that  I underst what it's the everybody has pride  some kd  identification but it should be I'm an American citizen  what's unique about what's really unique about this country is that none  us can go to   be fully accepted as Chese you can't go to Mexico  be fully accepted as a Mexican citizen unless you look like the majority population I can tell you as someone who's lived overseas for three years I could never be fully accepted as Greek because I don't look Greek  yet this is a country where we've come so far  that's your appearance your superficial appearance is not as important as your embrace  constitutional shared values  yet the very thg that that we're so good at is what people most criticize us for so I thk Trump was tryg to say I'm gonna stop all that  I'm gonna try to get back to the meltg pot   a beg Trump he wasn't subtle about that yeah so on that very topic  subtlety you know politics is ten  the art  language  you know if everyone  this audience when you thk Ronald Reagan many many thk  this the Great Communicator he boy could he use words right  your book you talk about when President Trump uses words ten times you thk he's quote clumsily exaggerates you know Trump's beg Trump like Reagan was Reagan you know if you could wave a magic w  all  a sudden Trump could be remarkable communicator  sensitive with his tweets  thgs like that you know would Trump be Trump I'm tryg to determe if this is someone you know yeah sure we'll fix him but I don't know that Trump would be Trump I tend to agree with that  you know everybody who has bet on the opposite pot  view sayg if he would just stop tweetg if he would just exp his vocabulary beyond a thous words or people just say there are more adjectives  the English language than awesome tremendous our adverbs like ley but I don't thk I thk you're right I thk what Trump is  all  his tweet Twitter wars he's reactive he rarely starts a fight he didn't start with : Kaepernick he didn't even start with his probably most notorious one with John McCa well I thought was a mistake for him to to besmirch John McCa but but McCa had called his supporters crazies  Trump was reactg to that when he was asked about it so he's reactive  he tries to brg more mega tonnage  the reply than the if the attacker  then you're very unwise because most people have a selfimage  Trump's actually been  a wrestlg match physically so if you want to get to a wrestlg match with him you're gonna lose because he doesn't care he's been  it  he doesn't have a sense  I mean everybody has a positive sense  self but it remds me I said to somebody  New York if you were to rate a B  C D partylist where would the Trump's be  he said F  I thought that was one  the reasons I liked it  there was somethg have you noticed when that I mentioned this but when Trump went places he had this tight tie  the hair  everythg so if he was  abama or Bakersfield or Flt Michigan he had the same act Queens accent he was authentically Trump when he'll we went to the south or New Engl it was you all  Boilermakers  bowlg when Obama went  the ner city he sounded like he could drop his G's when John Kerry was runng he had camouflage  ducks by the neck  I asked he came to Tulare California  I thought even Trump's gonna have to work cowboy hat no he just stood out he had his suit the long tie  the Queen's accent so people did what no would thought would be possible how could people identify as a populist a Manhattan billionaire with a Queens accent that very little cut he pulled f appearg more authentically pot populist than a real populist like John Casey CH who grew up as he always remded us as a son  a postman though there are so many paradoxes that we haven't really figured them all out yet with Tom you know I'm not sure I thk Trump vented that he certaly is quite used the term fake news  you know I've watched from the very start as he used that expression it was you know well sce news he either doesn't like or he thks just pla not written fairly that's what you know to Trump is fake news but I got the sense that as he started gettg more  more successful  convcg people that these news stories are just pla unfair  called it fake news the media took the bait  it feels to me like as much as they dislike Trump there now have squit have pressed editorial to news reportg  they really he's positioned them as the enemy  they've positioned him as the entity the second part  what's surprisg to me that almost don't mask the American media yeah would step across the le  show a visceral hatred  news reportg have you seen a precedent for that is no  we can we can say thgs but there are is data that liberal Shorenste Center at  said that the first six months  what's been worse was 85% negative coverage Obama was only 0 five  then got much better  Trump's down to 90% these six months bla we've never seen movie stars that compete whether it's Johnny Depp or Robert De Niro or Madonna or Kathy Griff they have a competition whether they can decapitate him burn him blow him up stab him  then we've never seen the admistrative state or the progressive media Nexus the moment he's elected let's sue for the let's sue to abort his presidency  three states by the the votg maches no let's try to persuade the electors not to follow their constitution remember those ads don't vote for him  then almost immediately 60s plus house representatives troduced articles impeachment for each set awarded  then we had the Logan act that's calcified we don't use it you then it was the 25th amendment that he was crazy they had a psychiatrist justify  then we had the Muller the hysteria about collusion with the steel fabricated stuff  then we had the Muller the look September 5th  last year we had anonymous  the New York Times remember said he's actively along with loyal Americans tryg to thwart the president I don't know what the McCabe Rosenste do you guys know it was kd   palace coup where they were gog to you know sort  take a straw poll the cabet before declarg him crazy  removg an elected president so the answer is no we've never seen that  I thk the medium is two really important thgs about Trump the first is that they just thought he was crude or blunt but he did he could at times display a level  selfdeprecation  even humor  empathy that because it was such a contrast with his public image that it was quite effective he went all through the Middle Midwest  I noticed he started sayg thgs that no an had ever said he said he'd go to esa' I'm worried about our vets I'm worried about not the farmers our farmers I'm worried about our machists I'm worried that our our our he got to West Virgia  Hillary Clton had come  said well I'm sorry but we're gonna have to bankrupt the coal dustry you're gonna have five new jobs  he said I love big beautiful coal nobody  his right md would say big beautiful coal he didn't care for his Polly wanted to display an empathy  he carried that state by almost 70 percent  then fally very quickly they don't underst the Nietzschean concept  survival with Nietzsche said anythg doesn't kill me makes me stronger so even dependents are lookg at him now  I have members  my family that didn't vote for him but they will concede that the age  72 to get up after four or five hours  sleep  hear your wife defamed your young son your adult children defamed hear that you're a crook a tax cheat the stormy debt all  that  yet get up every morng as if it's a new day  keep fightg there's a begrudgg respect my wife remded me  that I came home two days ago  I said God this guy called me a Nazi  this other guy said I was a racist  I said a guy on the plane wanted me to sign a book he saw me  I sign it then he put it back  hid it under the seat  he said it's like a red mega hat I can't show this   I I said god I don't know if I can take it  she said oh shut up he or you're writg about a guy you're writg about a guy who takes more  one day than you  your whole life so get with it so  history as you know the country's f sometimes been divided north south its way we've ten looked at politics thgs like that but  your book you go to some lengths to talk about what you call I don't even know if it's your words but they've forgotten terior  it's a true it's a real expose on the coast versus the terior  this nation  that's where the new divide seems to be here's my question on it I get the sense from readg your book that that you feel it's the Trump saw this  from a strategic perspective took advantage  it  followed a plan along those les  order to w yeah  when I read that I thought you know I don't know I you know just like it's tough for him to put together a sentence yet still run a country I was surprised that at least maybe between the les it felt like you're implyg that Trump was a strategist that he had this  md  executed agast it  I wonder if it was just really his raw stcts or did he really actually pursue a strategy to go here go there  take it I thk it was a mixture  both I thk that first  all he's considered himself an outsider an outer outer Burrell Queens accent person that was Garry Shlg ever be accepted  the Manhattan elite  he wanted to be  he thought that was unfair that he felt by the basis  merit what his buildgs that he deserved more recognition so there was a constant sort  anger at the elite  New York  that made him a little bit more empathetic he was a builder he was not a high tech guy  fancier a media mogul  other words he dealt with concrete physical thgs I'm thereby by extension people who laid cement  tyler's  unions so he he understood he couldn't build a buildg whistles guys were good  happy  I thk that gave him a level  sight about the other America but he also had 16 very gifted rivals far more gifted than two thous eight or twelve field  he had to distguish himself  then I thk he did notice with an nate cunng that they were sort  emulatg the Democratic PlayBook that America had changed then they were gog to give an identity politics or I thk when JEB said illegal immigration is basically a Zab you know it's an act  love  they were sort  progressive light  he saw an openg that he could Double Down especially when his advisors told him that there was about five to eight million people  I don't know what we would call him John maybe the the Reagan voter the the silent majority the Perot voter the Tea Party they didn't want to come out  vote for Mitt Romney  probably didn't come out if you do the math that didn't mean that he was gonna w these states by a lot but if he were to get them to come out  they would vote 80% then he could flip these states that nobody thought could be flipped by 60 80,000 votes less than a percent  some cases Michigan was call most flip Mnesota Ohio  sure Iowa  Indiana North Carola Pennsylvania  the message was I guess if I would boil it down is that under globalization anybody's labor physical labor muscularity that could be xeroxed abroad was on the prciple you know you're irreplaceable that was sort  crass but then the left or even some people the an Party reversed cause  effect they thought because your labor could be Xerox cheaper for machery or manufacturg therefore you were somehow culpable I thk somebody  the ional Review Kev Williams said you got to get  a pickup  just be your own fault it's toxic culture   they reversed the cause   fact  is it almost as if losers who took opiates drove away factories when it was just the opposite  so he understood that there was that that area had not been at loss I mean Detroit  195 was the fastest growg major city United States by some calibrations at Symphony museums were the fest the United States it had some  the highest per capita wealth Hiroshima was  rus  by September 1st 195 if you go to Hiroshima today it looks like Detroit should have been  Detroit looks like it was new  that wasn't because  a war it was because  globalization  changes  policy  government big liberal big government but what I'm gettg at is that he understood that the message  the forgotten man had electoral ramifications he also had a lot  people who were  the shadows that that we felt had been kd  losers themselves or eccentrics I mean especially Steve Bannon who might not have been a steady sober  judicious adviser but when they brought him on he really honed that idea  the forgotten man  a nationalist populist tweak we shouldn't be too exaggerated eighty percent  the Trump message deregulation judges pipele construction GDP tax reform try to appeal moment was purely an conservatism it was that tweakg  Bannon  others  then Peter like people Peter people like Peter Thiel I was at a dner once  he happened to be there  there was a very proment  America name I won't mention but tore to me for votg I was gog to about to vote for Trump  he said would the he's a loser he has no analytics Hillary has the smartest the best  the brightest these are wonky SH these are Millennials  mr. teal turned to me  said no actually Trump has the best analytics  the world said he does he said yes he's concentratg on the only states that mattered we know everybody said how would you know  he said I designed them  so there were people who helped that campaign  various ways that didn't get a lot  credit but deserve a lot  credit Mike Reagan was a transitional transformative president there's no doubt about it just he also noted that Trump picked up on 80%  what's been the Reagan an playbook for many years do you thk that what's Trump is succeedg  dog is will he be viewed  the future as a transformational president that it's very hard to tell because let's take wrong Reagan at the begng  1983 we were still  recession he was tryg to break flation we had been so desperate to break it we we had whip you know whip flation now buttons  I was farmg I remember an 83 I went to the production credit we had a family farm  I thought I was so lucky to get a 13% loan  I bought a used pickup for neteen  a half percent I thought that was high  then I had sulfur bags that I'd ordered sulfur  I noticed that it said $.99 $5.99 $6.99 they crossed out the price the flation was so high that they were markg them up  their ventory so  that was when Reagan was president  then I noticed every time he turned on the TV  83  if you remember there was a Hollywood movie about the end  days wagon was gonna cause a nuclear or wner I thk they even Carl Sagan was always her hectorg us about Reagan so Trump is that that that position you know  Reagan took a lot  heat  broke the back  flation restored fiscal sobriety but it took really if you look at November  1983  you go back  look at polls the unnamed Democratic cidate was runng sort  neckneck  then between e November  1983  November  198 the economy grew at 7% GDP it's absolutely stunng  then it was it wasn't even close so we'll see what one  the problems  writg a book is that the news changes so you have to trust historical stct  analytics  not get caught up  the 2 hour hour but so I tried to suggest that what the the measures that he's taken I thk we're gonna make him a very successful president  he has that Reagan has tendency one  the thgs I liked about Reagan is that people told him all the time he couldn't do somethg you can't say tear down that wall you can't call it an evil empire  his attitude well it's evil as an empire why not its people  that's what Trump is you know they Trump you you can't get out  you ran to you you cannot move the embassy to Jerusalem the Council on Foreign Relations will have a fit if you get out  the Paris climate Accord that kd  stuff  he doesn't care  that empowers ya you talk  the book at at some length about this concept via the electronic lynch mob yeah the social media that permeates our society today as relates to that particular phenomenon  this specific case volvg this young fellow Nixon  the Covgton Catholic school I see that he's maybe there's some real serious attorneys that are gog after  the media  a lot  the media you know to redress this knowg what you know  our society do you thk that they might possibly succeed or you know it's it's gonna be dismissed  we move on well I was fortunate to grow up with my mother was a second Superior Court judge a woman  California  then I thk the second appellate court so I always got lectures about the law  she always would say I wish it were true that cases are decided by the leg  the law but so ten the political atmospherics they affect judges they affect everythg  there was somethg about that young kid stg there beg hectored by this person who had fabricated almost everythg about his life beatg this drum  then that electronic lynch mob that made him an especially sympathetic character  so he was overwhelmgly he won the the sympathy  the country but I thk what we lacked there is that when we used to watch westerns  when the mob went to the jail to break   Lynch the the suspect there was always a sheriff with a doublebarrel shotgun we didn't have anybody like this  fact I really liked the editor  the publisher  ional Review but I almost came pretty close to resigng because we had a big fight not that they were on my side but some people as you know  ional Review were part  the lynch mob  I thought that that was just tolerable that without any evidence  I I remarked on it David I did watch six or seven hours  the video on anybody with any cognition could see that what the story was  then when he said that he gave the dates  Vietnam you knew that anybody knew the history the Vietnam War knew that was impossible for him to be a combat veteran you saw the the other thgs he said  yet there was a deep there's a deep illness  this country  it's mostly from wealthy white liberal people who want a virtue signal their own moral superiority  as they damned white privilege  they did that with Sagna  they always do it the expense  the workgclass white person it doesn't have white privilege it's almost like somebody  Malibu can say I'm so sick  the white privilege  that welder  Tulare  therefore by sayg that then he gets he gets to have that big fence around his estate  have Hispanic help  he's exempt because he said that  there was all this virtue signalg everybody was dammg this sy man  I was  a board meetg  a philanthropic organization  somebody happened to say this was atrocious  we didn't even know that one  the members had actually tweeted to condemn this kid so it was widespread  conservatives many  the conservative establishment were just as guilty as progressive  I really got upset about that as I did with a juicy Smollett case that was another example that's sort  I mean that was the it wasn't that kd  the ultimate trajectory  identity politics because what you were sayg what he was sayg to America was I'm gog to create the most unlikely impossible illogical scenario  the world  I'm gonna make America believe it because they're so deranged that I can get away with it  so it wasn't just I'm africanamerican but I'm gonna be African American  gay I'm not just gonna be African American gay I'm gonna be African American  I'm gonna hate Trump I'm not gonna be just African American hate Trump I'm gonna be young  hip Empire I'm not just gonna do all that but I'm gonna be walkg at 2 a.m.  I'm not just gonna be walkg 2 mute I'm gonna see two white guys who happen to be prowlg around liberal Chicago not just two white guys are dog it they're gonna have a maggot hat on they're not just gonna have a mag a hat on two white guys with a mega hat  liberal Chicago are gonna say we're gonna will prowl around because maybe Jesse's small at whom we immediately recognize  yell out as the enemy  empire cuz we always watch Empire  you know bob says to fred let's go out  look for Jesse small at type people tonight  by the way let's take some lynched rope with us  then Jesse's  if that's not enough let's get bleached that that freezes that five degrees  we'll throw it  defy the laws  chemistry it won't freeze  our case  then not only will will do all that will beat him up  we're very big but Jesse's juicy is very small but he's a better fighter  he's gog to fight us f why he's got his swich  one h  his cell phone  the other recordg the whole thg that's what we were asked to believe  the nation did  so I thk that was a really I thk historians will look at that pot  say that is about the limitations  the identity politics  after that pot it becomes a caricature because that wasn't factually impossible to believe  yet we wanted to believe because we wanted to say that Magga Trump supporters did this  there was no possible theoretical abstract way it was possible  yet we wanted to believe because we were full  such hatred  then when it was  then what was really strange about it was the therapeutic response what made him do it who drove him to this he's obviously disturbed I'm thkg no he just libeled half the country  people were walkg around  that was that he contributed to a hatred  a particular person based on their race  yet there's no contrition he's still peddlg this fantasy yeah so to that exact pot what I wanted to ask you extraordary description  the  events that took place was that so sgularly ridiculous that you thk it's the cident could somehow play like a an outsize or just a giant be a giant fluence  some respects on the 2020 election yeah I I do I thk they're cumulative as well I mean there was the Virgia for to false rape accusation there was a Duke Lacrosse cident there was the Cavanaugh hearg when fally Ldsey Graham had his have you no decency moment as Robert Welch good  the Karthi  then we had the Covgton  the juicy smaller I thk now people are so vaccated or to that that they don't believe it anymore whether that's good or bad I don't know but I thk that they feel that there's a large number  people  the United States not a majority but a very fluential mority that exercises fluence  power far beyond their numbers  they control the universities they control entertament Hollywood pressional sports the Foundation's the media  they're not empirical  they feel that they don't just want to margalize conservatives they want to destroy them  want to destroy what they represent  I I don't thk that's exaggeration when Nicasio Cortez said that the country was a little we don't have to be ten percent better than garbage  that FDR was a racist I thought to myself well I underst that United States had racist tendencies as all majority populations do but it was already selfcorrectg  that was that's the story  the United States tryg to become better  I thought to myself so all these people that Ocasio Cortez never even heard  rotted on the beaches  taro or they were blown up  a b17 or they froze to death  choice  Rosa var  they did it for what for this little person to come here  say to them you have a garbage country I don't thk people have to put up with  I don't thk that I don't thk they have to put up with it  I thk the reason that her parents came to this country is they understood somethg that she didn't that's a really terestg question why would you leave Puerto Rico or why would you leave Somalia  come here if it would if immediately upon arrival you  your children or your ass immediately have grievances agast your your new country it doesn't make any sense I know I was named after Victor Hansen it was killed at Okawa  the 6th Mare Division  I read his letters all the time  I can't believe that he died for a country  which major people call it garbage I just don't thk that's what he died for  each  us accordg to our own station has to speak out  say these people didn't die for that they didn't die  the Civil War they didn't they died for a better America not for some person that knows nothg about  I say that because  her empirically from what she's been sayg to subtly level an accusation agast an entire dead generation I really I'm gettg very angry at this idea we attacked the dead  we apply the stards  the present when most  us  the physical sense alone couldn't couldn't last a day  a covered wagon or we wouldn't have last but one moment at Shiloh  yet all  a sudden these people that's not why they're unhappy it's because  our path that's somethg deeper  to blame other people or their parents or past generation for their own ability to cope it's just it's cowardly  yet the longer that we let it go on  we don't challenge it then we become culpable ourselves so anyway it's f topic I've one last question  then we'd love to turn it to you  the audience to ask a few questions as well pressor I'm not askg you to prognosticate  you know make a specific prediction but do you thk that the odds that Trump will w aga  2020 are there are they  his favor would worry how do you see that I thk it's about fifty five forty five for a couple  reasons three or four reasons very quickly he's about at 2 to 5 dependg on his Twitter week he's about where Barack Obama  Bill Clton were at the begng  the third year both  them had worse midterms Clton lost 52 seats Obama lost 63 seats Obama lost six Senate seats Clton lost eight Trump lost 39 House seats maybe 0  he picked up two seats  then Clton demolished Bob Dole   Obama won hily over Mitt Romney so history suggests that it's Trump's race to lose that he has that power  cumbency he's gettg better I thk his speeches are better they're longer but they're still better I thk he's skg better he had so many problems with this revolvg door cabet sees but there's somethg about this new triage  Pompeo a Secretary  State  Bolton  especially bar at when bar the other day was asked that ambush question about the emergency declaration I thk Jeff Sessions a good man but he would have probably equivocate it  who knows what rod Rosenste would have said but Barr just stood up for him  so you get the impression that they do genuely believe  the Trump message  that helps him  then he's not runng  a vacuum everybody thks that president's run  a vacuum it's not a it's a mannequ choice between somethg sometimes good or somethg better or somebody bad  somebody worse that's what Americans do their practical pragmatist sce 2016 probably a quarter  the people who voted for Trump just could not abide by the idea  President Clton Hillary Clton this time it depends on do they really want to go the Mondale 8 as I said are 72 but when you put reparations  fanticide is permissible abortion the new Green Deal bowrg the a bar  the ternal combustion enge Medicare for all I can't even remember all 16 year old votg  felons can vote  Florida wealth tax we've never had an already tax capital 90% rate you put all that basket together  they're gonna try to tar every nomee  that brutal primary to endorse that  so Trump will be we don't know how well they're gonna tar those people but Trump as it looks now will be able to say you may not like me but I'm the only thg stg between you  socialism or worse you know so the idea that Joe Biden who said that rge Bush should get on TV the way that FDR did on 1929 when there was neither TV nor FDR was president  you know he said everythg from gonna put you back  change so I'm gonna take Trump out buyg the the gym  that's the sober  judicious cidate so we'll see but I thk he has about a fifty five percent chance barber will depend on usually what rus  cumbency is a economic downturn or an unpopular war or some sort  scal I I don't see him dog an optional military large tervention I don't I thk the economy will survive a recession  I thk the Mueller vestigation I could go on all night but I don't thk they're gonna fd collusion that was its mate so I thk he'll be it'll be up to how well the campaign is run  how well he can tag the opposition is somethg we've never seen sce 1932 question is if you have a question we've have several people  the audience our staff with microphones if we can just wait to ask your question but the microphone  your h we'll start right here Thank You pressor really appreciate it I'm really enjoyg also your onle world war two course thank you with Hillsdale which is awesome one fun question than one one I've been thkg about lately who would you thk from your military history  study kd  tactically Fitz Trump that you might thk  as far as stctual coverg ground wng before the wars even fought  then kd  a question I've been thkg about the Bolshevik Revolution where it wasn't too high a percentage  people that were Bolsheviks were actually  control  the message that was out there I kd  relate that with the media today so I was wonderg your thoughts on that yeah well just a fun there are people  American history that are very trumpian William Tecumseh Sherman said to the media on the march through rgia I'm gonna hang all  you if you don't if you write another thg  then he he he would have  he was considered crazy  fact he was relieved to comm  1862  considered certifiably they called it melancholy  those days Patton if you look at Patton's personal life  because we're  a polite audience I won't mention thgs that Patton did but they make Trump's look pretty normal  if you did if you had a sober  judicious  very wonderful man like Omar Bradley Patton's immediate superior he was a wonderful man but if he had been commg Third Army  Patton was not there we would have lost another 0,000 dead Curtis LeMay oh my gosh he said if we lose the war I'll be tried as a war crimal but what he meant was he took a a billion dollar Manhattan Project bigger than the Manhattan Project excuse me the b29  he took it from 30,000 feet down to 7,000 feet  turned it to a veritable dive bomber because the bombs given the jet stream  the altitude  then we're  the enge it was not workg it was a big disaster  he took out 120 days 75 percent  the dustrial capacity  Japan  he was on the cover  Time magaze  considered a hero  by the early 60s he was dr. strange madman that we all hated that's sort  what Trump is I thk he's I said that  the book he's a tragic hero as long as we realize what that term means it means somebody who's got particular skill sets that we brg  whether it's Shane or Gary Cooper  high noon or John Wayne   Searchers or the Magnificent Seven  they start to solve the problem but as they start to solve the problem they give us the luxury  beg hyper critical  critical  the methods they do that we consider our saviors uncouth so I thk that as the economy gets better we can we have the luxury now  criticizg Trump I don't thk Trump is gog to be vited to funerals after as presidents or after he's out I don't thk he'll be considered a I thk he'll do more for the United States  most  our ex presidents have that are alive  yet he will not be accepted with the same respect that they are  that's just the tragedy  somebody right out  Sophocles or maybe Dirty Harry test thank you very much I'm really concerned about the lay  the l the federal level state level for voter fraud  I am hopg you can perhaps share some sight on steps maybe that are  the work excuse me  the works or can be planned for to hle voter fraud you all know what happened  Orange County but my congressional representative was a wonderful man David Bal Dail from Portuguese immigrant family  he won the midterm I thk about 18% is his ternal polls were showg him 12 up on the election week he won I thk by five pots six pots on Election Day he lost by 500 votes so what happened is was sameday registration  the new 19 2017 wall that said a non family member could go to a home register  have the vote  deliver to the register hundreds  thouss  people took data from the DMV  they said these people fit a particular pattern the DMV had said we had mixed people who were here illegally with here non legally with their licenses  he said it was only a few thous we don't know if that's accurate but nevertheless they were able to be very clever they didn't do it  the midterm so all these ans had won the midterms or at least did better than their general election opponent  they let down their guard  then they were overwhelmed with this brilliant but Machiavellian strategy  the short term there's nothg you can do unless you change start changg the laws or revert back what they were or you sue or you both harvest  by that I mean you get your own computer analytics  you say there's this many ans are conservative leang people who didn't register or they're registered  didn't vote  I'm gonna have a guy go to their home I'm gonna sit there until they h me the ballot that's a poor support remedy for a democracy but I don't know how you're gonna do  the short I'm very worried  I thk their theoretical e the California congressional district that so Representatives only seven now out  52 or 53 I thk we could get down to one or two with this vote harvestg   course if you object to it they've already prepped the battlefield so you're sensitive you're exclusionary you're racist etc etc but it's a that's a very good question there's no answer yet to it over here we're very proud that you're a California resident  as someone who's lookg to leave the state because I believe strongly  a twoparty system  we don't have that here what do you what recommendations do you have for those  us  California who are livg here livg  a oneparty state what what do you see what hope is there well my only hope is I guess herb Ste said Nixon's economic by anythg that can't go on won't go so you have a state now where this was a paradise  the 70s  80 we had good governance governor here but we have the highest basket I thk we're second or maybe we're first with a 13pot to top rate  come tax we're about number three  sales tax our gas tax will be number one most expensive  yet when you look for commiserate advantages many  the ratgs  our frastructure were 7 I thk 8 or high school  eighth grade test scores about 5 we have some  the highest skill a second highest kilowatt rates  the United States its third highest overall gasole's I thk we have 21%  the state lives below the poverty le we have one third  all welfare recipients so whatever happened if we had the worst  both worlds it's very expensive for the middle class to live here  you get very little  return  so that can't go on for much longer when I go to Palo to  I see that very wealthy people who virtue signaled their liberality  they live these expansive homes  Woodside  beautiful homes an old pal Walter  Atherton then I go back where I live  salmo rural Fresno County  on an August day when it's 109 outside Hispanic families are  Walmart they're not there to buy thgs they're takg their whole family because they cannot afford to turn on the aircondition  that's even with lifele rates so it seems to me that there is a potential  a lot  emergg people  a nontraditional middle class  they're startg to ask questions why do I have to pay the highest gasole why do I have the highest electricity why is the 99 freeway a deathtrap who  the world created this debacle Stonehenge Matt highspeed rail monstrosity over the Fresno why didn't we build the three reservoirs these are not right when people askg those questions  when they get when they start I thk they'll start to resemble at some pot the rebellions we had with the Reagan Revolution  the 60s  70s but we're not there yet as to get a little worse I'm afraid before they get angry because but I know a lot  people I have Mexican American people with my family  a lot  people are askg questions that are very embarrassg wires dianne feste attackg catholicism why is kamala harris attackg the Knights  Columbus who dreamed up the idea you could kill a baby  call it abortion who who who told us that transgendered restrooms were the most important thg  California so we'll see what happens but I thk that that constituency I am not sure won't gradually become a little bit more conservative we have time for two more questions I'm gog to go here given your knowledge   the parallels you've given us today  written  about  your book let's image for a mute that Ronald Reagan was alive  here  could actually give President Trump some advice what do you image that would be well they hated but we forget now the degree to which they hated Reagan  we forget I was so shocked that when rge W Bush came to Hoover  gave a nice speech but I don't thk he realized how much they hated him just  2007  8 they called him a Nazi they vote articles about killg him but Reagan they really hated but Reagan had that  I I don't know as much nearly as the people here at the Reagan Library but he had a unique ability to smile  laugh at all  he was when he had a wng character a personality so Trump has elements  that when durg the Cavanaugh hearg you remember that moment it's the best moment he's had mr. presidency someone said will cavern you thk Cavanaugh drunk drank too much no but I know that if I did I'd be a total disaster can you image me with alcohol that's why I never that was kd  f the cuff Reagan  if Trump I thk Reagan would tell him I know that I had the establishment fally behd me but you know I was a renegade  68  76 when I tried to get the nomation  they said I was crazy so I I've gone through what you have but you got a role you've got to be a little bit you've got to have some moment your life or you can disarm your critics through calmness or  jocular language rather than just go for the jugular every sgle time  then I thk Trump would say yeah it's easy for you to say but now Lee I'll leave it at that yeah last question I'm sorry that will go up here a friend  the balcony pressor Hanson a piece  strategic advice if the election was beg held right now what would you suggest a president Trump should be his major slogan or message his ma slogan other than I saved you all I'd say yourself I would say it's somethg like America's great aga somethg like that but what he really needs to do is that I thk I get frustrated because everybody who doesn't have any responsibilities has all these ideas whose consequences we never suffer they go bad but what I would suggest to him is that the Democratic Party is so frontloaded to identity politics  tribalism that they've lost the white workg classes whether they like it or not the percentages are astoundg  the number  people who don't have college degrees we know now is larger than the people who do  college is gettg a hit even more with this admittance scal but what I'm gettg at is that Trump has done more for mority voters than Democrat then Obama ever did we have record low a black unemployment we have record low Hispanic unemployment abortion has devastated the africanamerican Jesse Jackson  all people called it genocide no person has been more adamantly agast the present abortion practices than Donald Trump Issa  that's been very good for morities that message he's he's not anti religious he's not antisemitic he's not anticatholic  those stras are deeply now embedded with the Democratic Party closg the border  havg legal mara Craddock measured  diverse immigration helps entrylevel workers it doesn't cut their wages through cash f the books undercuttg labor so he's got a lot  wng arguments for the mority  what I'm gettg at is that he doesn't need to w 0 percent  the African American vote or 50 percent Lato vote for those people who identify themselves as Latos or fred he just needs 20 percent 15 percent the africanamerican vote 0 percent  the Democrats their whole calculus is shattered because they've lost such this old workgclass Hubert Humphrey worker so that's what I really really like to see  do is go out with spokespeople  go to the ner city he'd be booed but if he just keeps his cool I thk that would be it would pay enormous dividends  he's already startg to do that a little bit I hope he can contues that's that's what most fight was a Democratic Party you really want you to stick around if you can to visit with Pressor Hansen  get this book it's gog to be one  the best books you've read  years [] []"
110,1.0,"[] which is absolutely astonishg I never thought we would see this it's sittg here dog nothg  spng here hormones already month people have put this  their recyclg bs they thought it was gonna be recycled  yet it's just stuck  this logjam what they actually gave you from the  was a mix  who knows what I'm not supposed to gettg this no one wants it there was high hopes for this it's gonna be recycled it was gonna have a new life now because it's been shipped like this it's just lfill father [] [] we've never consumed so much  a lot  it is plastic we produce 20 times more plastic today than we did 50 years ago I want to fd out what happens to it all where does it go  how much  it actually gets recycled what I discovered was a system that pushes the problem f our shores the end result plastic pilg up  it isn't gog away it all starts here at home like a lot  families we produce our fair share  waste I thk we're a bit different when it comes to recyclg I thk I'm a good recycler but what do you thk twothirds  us admit to beg confused about what can  can't be recycled plastic bottles  ts bottles that's recyclable plastic presumably that's what's wrong with that people talk about washg it but I'm just not sure whether you need to do that I just get it fish with it as soon as they're fished with it I just brg it  the b done this isn't recyclable film but it's plastic so this shouldn't be  that b did you put it  I do fight I genuely do fd the whole thg very confusg  I'm not convced that it's actually worth dog so why is it up to me I want to know more so I'm hitchg a ride with the guys who collect my own recyclg bs there are 50 councils with varyg collection schemes  differg rules about what can  can't be recycled if you don't get it right it won't be collected [] [] you want to see [] [] [] tell me now because [] so you're washg your big pots out  you sort your glass bakg ss wash out if not smellg all the time the bs are the day's collection ends here my local depo it's then picked up  hauled f to a sortg plant  there's a lot  it  just one year British households throw 22 million tons  waste to the b EU targets dem that we recycle half  that by 2020 but rates are stagnatg it just % [] I started  this job  January it opened my eyes to recyclg we're not gog to places like these you see em which can actually go to a lorry it's very very distressg 20 today you thk 20 20 day or two but if you thought all  that plastic ended up beg recycled then you're  for a big shock all this plastic might get collected but it doesn't mean it'll get another life we know that we used to recycle very little deed we know that if you take some products you are recyclg probably 0 or 50 percent  what what goes to the marketplace but we know on other thgs that we're actually recyclg practically nothg on a global scale the numbers are staggerg 78 million tons  plastic packagg get produced every year  then after very ten a very short use just 1%  the plastic packagg gets collected for recyclg  even less  that just 2% gets recycled at high quality to new packagg then another 1% gets burnt after use another 0% gets lfills  I quite staggerg one thirds  all plastic packagg ends up pollutg the environment I found it astonishg that around the world only 2%  our plastic packagg gets recycled I wanted to see what happened with my plastic when I was  my kitchen the other day my children even their yogurt pots as we do a lot from time to time those yogurt pots end up  here right absolutely absolutely those yogurt pots end up here along with about 60 thous tons  other people chocolate pots to it  course we're here by the time my Recyclg's led here it's traveled nearly 200 miles  gone through countless hs it's an dustry that employs nearly 20,000 were we take  material from people's bs  we turn it back to resources by the time the waste that's behd you leaves here it's actually quite a valuable commodity expla what the market is like for plastic  the moment the market for plastic is it's fairly volatile but it's fairly strong it's all resources all  this is resources  I don't want to wait a bit we want to turn those to the maximum value for the market we possibly can it turns out that a lot  our plastic doesn't get processed here it's exported overseas  one country has taken more  it than any other  we live  a commercial world it's no different to any other material it will go wherever the market dem is it will go to the highest bidder  has been an important market for the export  plastics from the   imports 10 million tons  classic they don't do it just to get plastic at home they do it because they needed to feed the manufacturg process it's a value commodity it's a resource that gets used to produce products it's not a way  disposg a material but as 's appetite for plastic scrap creased the big problem started to develop whole villages grew dedicated to sortg through the world's filthy plastic one man documented what he found I'd like you to carve India Oh trouble I get a gimbal triple IG evitable like a little bit come  wdow okay can I try namah namah namah balaji me with you Carol are you sure don't go so don't know you can fit onto my a juicer don't poet gentlemen will you go together like it fit under the adduction come on Elijah to shower me return it to them the largest tuna her hsome up a true leader sure who you will fire you di di don't go high eatg for that teacher dog with your she it was a wakeup call for  who saw this as a big problem they had to deal with their reaction would send shockwaves around the world I'm tryg to fd out what happens to all our recyclg it's a journey that's taken me thouss  miles to the other side  the world Hong Kong is the world's gateway to  it's through this artery that much  the world's plastic scrap passes on its way to be processed on the mal  July 2017  rocked the recyclg world by announcg it would impose tough restrictions on the import  foreign waste they called it national sword we've become more more conscious  waste we've seen a lot more publicity more  more people know that they want to recycle they get very frustrated when they can but they don't know where it goes this assumption that it will be beg reprocessed  made to good thgs  the  but frequently it's not because easier  cheaper to put to a contaer  send it through on to  why not government equally is it's movg the problem away it's still achievg our recyclg targets they've been said but it's maybe it's somebody else's expense just tryg to sum up to me what our policy  the  has been regardg  she needs a solution let's put  a contaer  felixstowe  wave byebye but  is sayg I'm havg for a little while why are we receivg your mixed rubbish so they became normal straight under a program called national sword cha's message was brutally clear any dirty contamated plastic would be flatly rejected the kd  plastic Brita's been sendg  for decades we export about 60%  the packagg plastic waste that we collect   that twothirds that we export about a third 0%  that goes to  operational national sword had big impact  that it's always half the amount  plastic   that's the problem that we've now got  who are now sayg actually we don't want this low quality stuff anymore so we're gog to close our doors  you're gog to have to fd somewhere else fdg somewhere else for the plastic is provg very difficult I've come to meet Tony Wong he's been tradg plastic for 20 years  he has a lot  it sittg  this yard  Hong Kong because  won't take it so this is full  varyg amounts  plastic it is it's about a value  that over $10,000 but now because stuck  here  that the market changed because  the importg maybe $7,000 20% down so stuff that's been washed  clean  this is good stuff for you nothg wrong with this nothg at all look at this even though spout  I can see you're very passionate about this this is I see the money I see I see the busess to me not like sonic oh well it's a cold  here it's very stard kd  items buzz you just need a country that's willg to take it  course yes  that's the problem yes to put home for them to turn back to value this is now the world's bottleneck for plastic scrap tons  it stuck  limbo the big question now where's it all gog to go meet the man who's made his fortune  recyclg Steve Wong works with Tony to import tens  thouss  tons  plastic through Hong Kong to be processed   these plastic film bags have come over on the contaer from the United Kgdom to here to your place [] but 's ban means Steve has to ship his plastics somewhere else he's lookg to neighborg countries  which to process 's unwanted plastic he's headg to Thail  I'm gog with him [] over several days I followed Steve from site to site he's runng out  time to fd a place which is capable  dealg with the plastic he wants to recycle [] where is what is that myself experience to feel about it the big question here is whether Thail can cope with what  is rejectg [] what we saw it one processg plant put all that  doubt here we found recyclg from the  sittg we were told for more than a year then more disturbg biohazard bags beg melted down to be turned to anythg from children's toys to household appliances  tastes like more decent than this place please quite messy I see water everywhere  although their production right now is see not a broken mache [] what struck me was the bags  bags  well non recyclable waste that was some  it was clearly from the  that was just gonna sit there for however long is that a sign  what can get through the system what can slip through the net I thk this is why  stoppg pottage on the plastic wrap because exporters they thought they did anythg the ban on importg recycled plastics to  can be a great opportunity for the  it forces the  to rethk how they deal with their plastics post use it can also go the bad way where we would contue exportg the plastics for abroad where the frastructure is even worse than    where we have to believe it gets recycled because we have collected  sorted  send it there but actually what happens there is it perhaps gets burnt or it gets treated  a way that's negative for the local environment I wanted to know how Brita would cope if we had to deal with our own plastic stead  sendg it abroad what's gonna happen when  closes the door it wasn't gonna be good news I've spent months vestigatg what happens to our recyclg  all a plastic we've been sendg abroad all these years a staggerg 60 percent  exports have been gog to one place  problem is they don't want it anymore I've come to one  the biggest plastic processors  Brita to fd out why we've been sendg so much material abroad  where all this plastic is gonna go now Petey is  the region  200 pounds a ton that's carbonated drks  water bottles milk bottles detergent bottles they're about 300 pounds  top why are you exportg it why can't we just deal with it here  the  restrictions  the 's capacity historically that hasn't been a growth that matches the recovery  the materials from the waste management authorities  local authorities the capacity doesn't meet the dem we're not a big isl we've got small amount  l mass where do we put this material I thk it's a failg  the system it's easier to put it  a contaer  export it rather than spend significant amounts  money puttg a processg plant it's wellknown that there is a poor auditg system for materials that go overseas to  or Asia particularly it's generally out  sight out  md I'd rather not know what's happeng to it as long as it's not on our back door truth  the matter is is that we will have no idea at all whether this gets a new life actually properly recycled no we don't we don't know whether it's burn buried or just left on the side  the street so we don't have enough processes to deal with all our plastic but there's another reason we've been pushg our waste abroad all these years the packagg recovery note or PRM is a government subsidy designed to encourage recyclg let's take a turn  plastic scrap a  recycler processes that plastic  because  contamants like labels glues or liquids might only get half a ton  recycled plastic from it they would earn half a subsidy or half a PRN however an exporter can take that ton  plastic scrap contamates  all  ship it f to be recycled abroad that turn  scrap is counted as fully recycled  the full PRN subsidy is earned but no checks are made as to how much recycled plastic is actually produced  so it encourages export PRN system was designed to subsidize the recycler to help him confidence to vest  more equipment that will recycle more material that will then grow the frastructure  the  but unfortunately the system was designed but it was weighted towards the exporter for that whole bale would be eligible for a PRN whereas those as a recycler we're only eligible for what we separate  reprocess the wait for the exporter is much more attractive than that  the recycler so once it goes  this contaer the whole contaer gets issued with that evidence no direct whereas if you have to deal with it  the  it might only be like 0 50 percent if you're lookg correct so the centive is to bug it  a contaer  send it away still get the credit for it  fact for all  it rather than deal with it here  the  correct correct we're not gettg the full value  that subsidy whereas the exporter is gettg the full value by weight it seemed to me that the ban imposed by  could actually be an opportunity for British busess Javed Mao ji set up his own plastic processg busess  201 he tried to do the right thg by recyclg here  the  how would you describe how brita's recyclg dustry what state do you thk it is  it's absolutely terrible I mean the it's a it's a mishmash it doesn't work properly  it's the whole structure  the British recyclg sector at the moment seems to be focused on export the wastes don't process it here because there's no centive to process anythg here there's an centive export when it launched Jabez company Ecotec was dog well but success was shortlived he just couldn't compete with the exporters how does it feel comg back to it that's pretty unpleasant Ashley but I mean I haven't been back here sce the company went to admistration there's a very very paful process not only fancially but also  terms  lost jobs  also  terms  lost capacity for the 's recyclg busess so we we as a  company we would get a PRN on what actually came out the other end so whereas if you were exportg you would get a PRN on the entire value so if you export plastic bottles on the records you've recycled all  them that's correct but not necessarily all  them were recycled that's exactly but it had absolutely no bearg on the figure that was jotted down on the book well I thk I thk that the reality is is the  was likg rates are exaggerated by the PRN system so you  a way would say that you you were a victim  that system absolutely yeah  so what is the centive from the government to get rid  a system which is favorable to our recyclg rates well it's it's it's it looks like we were cyclg far more than we are [] it's a problem what that system does not only does it mean we're over reportg recycle rates we're actually undermg the competitiveness  our own domestic plastic reprocesses we're actually exportg value we could be reprocessg that material here we had better quality material if we were makg sure that we were accountg for the recitg properly we would not have this competitive disadvantage for our domestically processes these are beg those overseas it is a serious flaw that we don't know well enough what happens to quite a bit  the recyclg we export a lot  plastic to be recycled I myself thk that we should have a system where we are much more likely to use that at home because you know where it's gone if you export it  it's creasgly difficult to do that the Chese are creasgly not acceptg it you don't always know where it's gone this is where it's gone I was about to discover what happens when the recyclg system fails there are thouss  tons  plastic scrap lyg  this yard shipped from the   contaers tons  tons  plastic sittg  a yard on the outskirts  Hong Kong dog nothg to it spng here for months already I haven't go to the site to look at the material you sent me the photos which  course not like this what were you expectg we're expg on a bottle  what did you actually get  the end film Richard plastics  even some pavement here no one willg to hle it ok the one wng because labor tensive no one wants it no one wants it it's just lfill fodder it was an extraordary sight this recyclg had been collected  then shipped just like the system encouraged now it had been left to rot how do you feel about the person who shipped this to you then we found bags from Chelmsford Council  Essex  I realized that this plastic had travelled nearly six thous miles hundreds  tons  plastic recyclg from British homes sits  Hong Kong dested for lfill it's a shockg sight  dishearteng to thk that people have taken the time to sort it thkg they were dog the right thg amongst it all we found household recyclg bags from Chelmsford Council  Essex so I went to Chelmsford Council to see what they know about where their recyclg goes  what's ultimately done with it a lot  priorities do these are collection system bags we allow about 3.5 per week through the residents which we deliver free  charge once a year we put a lot  trust  the people that take away obviously our material I went to Hong Kong two weeks ago I fd a yard like this this arrow is a pack  recyclg from the  unfortunately that comes from Chelmsford Council it was not to the quality that the the receivg end wanted  so it was rejected  the unfortunate fact is that you can never tell where your materials gog I thk that will be absolutely vestigated there's no way we can be happy about that no no from what you've just highlighted somethg has gone wrong down the road which obviously raises a huge question for us doesn't it really one will be vestigated  once we fd out the detail behd it we would take steps to take whatever steps are needed to resolve it we don't want the idea that our material is endg up  a lfill site on foreign ls or or  a yard somewhere we want to make sure that material is beg recycled as we've explaed to our residents then I received a package sent anonymously photographs  plastic packagg from the  dested for recyclg but now it appeared left sittg on a site  Pol it looked like another case  which the system had gone badly wrong I wanted to know more so I headed to Pol  took along an expert on plastic packagg to take a look approachg the East End district  twenty years  beg volved  packaged  weeks the last fifteen so bills or plastic it's quite common so this yard is owned by a British plastics exporter the same exporter whose plastic we found  Hong Kong it's a mix  bottles tubs food trays  film all piled up  bales oh this is carrier bags wow these are beyond you say Clank Wow the first thg is its degraded to such a level it's not really viable for recyclg it's not really suitable for the safe  it anythg that's held stored on a safe for over 12 months has deemed to be aimed disposal  therefore a lfill  that that could be that can be deemed as a tra  there could be prosecution types  taken agast to me it looks like it's evitable destations a lfill so it looks like curbside recyclg certaly this carrier bags there that from a local council that's sure that householders gog to the effort  puttg all their plastic waste to a bag this is Chelmsford Council it's not the first time I've seen a Chelmsford council bag  a place where you wouldn't expect these are mixed waste feels what it means as it's cardboard metals plastic all mixed together  the if they've come from the   certaly with some  the contaers on here it looks like they're from the  they shouldn't be exported what is the chance that this was brought here to be recycled because  the high amount  cardboard  it  it's beg stored outside there's no chance  this beg recycled plastic scrap shipped from the  can earn a packagg recovery note or PRN that's the evidence note to say somethg's beg recycled but no one checks to see if it's actually beg recycled  credibly it counts as recycled towards our EU target the exporter gets paid no matter what I mean you could say that the whole package recovery note system for exporters is like just like money for nothg license to prt money you could say that but the tention  the system was that the money from prm's would go back to creasg frastructure but it looks like  some cases it's beg abused I thk the systems got that herent risk  it when thgs are transported across countries across boundaries it's very difficult to keep track  them the amount f  I'll call it pure waste that is lyg on the ground the films that have degree deeds the carrier bags that are freakg to nothg  it's highly unlikely those were gog to be recycled so effectively they've been brought here to cool  told to get disposed f we found more evidence  plastic from Brita endg up overseas  some  it was so badly decayed that lfill was the only option we contacted Chelmsford Council aga to tell them we'd seen more  their recyclg  Pol after lookg to it Chelmsford confirmed that the plastic we'd found  Hong Kong  Pol had gone through companies accredited as re processors  exporters  packagg waste from the Environment Agency they said they rema confident their approach has the least environmental impact  all recyclg practices the reason why Brita has been sendg so much plastic overseas is that the PRN system actively encouraged it among those who are critical  the scheme is the man who came up with the idea  the first place former Environment Mister John Gummer now Lord eben there are several problems with it first  all I don't thk we have sufficient control over where it goes secondly I don't thk we have sufficient control over the quality  what is  there  other words you can have mixed up  that material thgs that are not gog to be recycled  the third thg is  is now from the 1st  January not to accept it I thk we ought to be recyclg it here   the rest  Europe but the problem is as you well know is the the problem with the PRN or the PRN system is it centivizes export it does  certa circumstances you are centivized to export it that's nonsense  shouldn't happen  we should change it  2015 Defra commissioned a series  dependent briefg notes lookg at the PRN scheme we've obtaed them they raised concerns about the system the briefg notes warmed that competition is sufficient  there's a lack  transparency  that local counsel so little if any benefit from the money raised the system was seen to favor export with low quality waste providg a cheap disposal route for contamants  worrygly the papers repeated concerns that the PRN scheme doesn't work to encourage vestment  the  reprocessg dustry but these briefg notes were never made public  no changes were made to the PRN system  tune Michael Gove was appoted Environment Secretary  walked straight to a crisis a month later  said they'd ban imports at the start  2018 a committee  MPs wanted to know what the new environment secretary was gog to do about it what impact do you thk this will have on the  waste economy will have it's a very good question  somethg to which I'll be completely honest I want to firstly just go back to November 2 that environmental audit committee where they were talkg about the impact  the ban that  is tendg to impose on plastic imports  you'll remember you said that you hadn't given it much thought given that British busess British processors believed that this is huge do you regret that yes it's a significant issue I haven't given it enough thought but what we're dog now is everythg we can  order to ensure that we turn what is a challenge to an opportunity we've been exportg too much waste what we need to do is to make sure that we reduce the amount that we produce  also process more  it at home do you thk that we have the capacity now to deal with the plastic that would have otherwise gone to  naturally the fact that 's gog to close its doors to a significant amount  that plastic that's an additional challenge on us here  the  I want to talk about capacity because I want to spend the next mute  this terview just showg you some footage that we filmed  Pol   hong kong it shows tens  thouss  tons  plastic on yards that has been aboned what's your view about what you've just seen well it reforces the case for the reforms that I've already explaed that we plan to implement that the PRN scheme at the moment while it has significantly improved recyclg rates  recyclg rates have grown over the course  the last 20 years it's still not good enough then the government revealed its long awaited 25 year plan for the environment  that plan the government provided no details  any proposed changes to the PRN scheme we're probably deludg ourselves we thk we have a system that's better than it is  actually if it isn't a very good system well we should improve it but it must be recognizg that helpg the environment does come at a cost the cheap way is let's dump it somewhere else I don't thk we're planng quick enough  I thk it means vestment I thk it means government support  I thk we need facilities such as these to accept that volume  material we have to look at reprocessg it domestically it's our waste our problem we should be recyclg it when I first started this journey I had no idea where our recyclg ended up but I found it scattered thouss  miles across the globe aboned  yards from Eastern Europe to Asia out  sight out  md what I learned was that until we as a nation take responsibility for what we put  our bs create a system we can trust this problems gog to pile up  we can't afford to ignore it

111,1.0,[] well here we are  the Indian Ocean a very remote part deed  the Indian Ocean we are 35 metres down that is four hundred  forty two feet take  the view I guess  the next hour we'll explore an area  the ocean which is uncharted undiscovered unknown just above the Twilight Zone beneath us f the coral atoll  dabra it is a mission to discover new species to fd new life  to see if man's impact stretches to this priste  protected part  the world well it is science it is exploration it is adventure all combed  has never been done before on a live television program this is a world first dabra is famous for its remoteness  for its very treacherous currents anythg could happen so don't go anywhere sit back enjoy the views like we are  let us take you down to the depths very cozy  here gettg warmer by the mute I have to say  one person that I'm already very well acquated with is my pilot for this mission Ry holt thank you so much for havg us  well what an extraordary workg environment you have it's amazg down here you know I every dive is different  we get to go places where people have never been before so expla where we are gog to change the cameras which I can do we've tucked herself to a crevice if we are 135 meters  yeah we're kd  leang agast the edge  a cliff an underwater cliff we were fightg some down drafts  some up drafts when we got to this position so we just kd  perked ourselves on a ledge  are tryg to stay stationary  I should give you a proper title  course you are  aquanauts if an astronaut explores space you explore the deep yes you know where an ner space it's a whole new place down here  you know it's a 3d environment so we're always movg around because know where we are how how we're movg through the water column are we lighter are we done for heavier all that it's it's it's amazg to watch you with all the controls  as you said you're flyg these submersibles you're not drivg them  as you said the oceans make up 97%  the habitable space on planet Earth which gives you both a sense  the depth  the oceans but also that 3d environment that Ry was talkg about we have adjoed an expedition led by the scientists  the natural mission their aim is to perform a deep ocean health check to map to chart to sample to see perhaps what no one has ever seen before  even search for those rarely seen species lurkg  the shadows the dream perhaps  a sixgill shark or even a Celia camp the Do fish thought to be extct for millions  years  crucially to see what is happeng to that ten colourful coral as it faces unprecedented threats it is so important as habitat  home to millions  species the big question for the scientists is could the deeper ocean be a refuge from the dangers  climate change  even from plastic pollution that we've talked so much about at sky well we are not alone down here this is some one the red one although it's been showered by this downdraft  sediment which you will hear the team referred to as Omega out there we can see them is sub to the yellow at the yellow one yes the yellow one what we have the red one I've already forgotten I wish they called Kensgton should we see if we can raise them actually because  there is the prcipal scientist on this amazg expedition dr. Lucy Woodall from the nectar mission  pilotg her sub is Robert Carmichael let's see if we can raise them on the ship on the air so yeah underwater telephone Kensgton Kensgton Omega come back [] I'm gonna pass you f there now to terview Lucy about the importance  [] try aga try aga hello Lucy can you hear me hello Lucy can you hear us I was just askg you about the reasons you're tryg to explore the deep [] [] Thank You Lucy I try  talk to you a little bit later thank you so the scientists have been comg down as I said very delicately tryg to take samples  some  the deep puddles that we've seen some  their the fans that are absolutely beautiful certaly  they very delicately take some  those  back up to the surface  up on the surface if we pair up we can see the outle  the mothership above  up there is my colleague Mark Aust mark we're up here we're safe  well amazg I just can't believe that we're seeg you  hearg you like this just I mean just give us a sense  how we feelg right now well it's well apart from beg very hot it's just quite extraordary just before we came on air we saw a white tip shark very near help down there was it to thk rom oh it was three meters away three meters away from us you never know quite what you're gog to see all above us it gets more  more blue down beneath us it's like a murky brown color it looks very very forbiddg I have to say  so the deep beneath us we already went down there to about a hundred  seventy five meters but above it looked pleasantly light I can see small fish dancg on this rocky outcrop just above  obviously it's nice to have the company  the prcipal scientist Lucy Woodall so great to be here mark but tell us a bit about where we are  just f algebra which I suppose is called the mothership it's a it's a supply ship but right now it's anythg but a supply ship it's sort  travellg up as first  all a TV Operations Center I don't we can see the guys workg  the porter cab that's on this deck  they've got the controls  they are the reason why those pictures from you are gettg to us  then from us beg satellited to the viewer so big television operation on this ship also the ma reason how the ship is here it's basically a mare research scientific center  I thk also we can see now pictures  the scientists hopefully  their  their little laboratory here several little laboratories here where they take samples they analyze these samples  they look at data  they take a lot  the samples back to the  so this ship anythgg butter supply ship right now Thomas More's with me you've been lookg at the pictures they're from down below you've been here as well for three weeks what do you make  what you're seeg absolutely fantastic Anna's sayg there there's you seen a white tip reef shark I image she will see many many more I was walkg through the shallows with black tip reef sharks yesterday comg right up to my legs no harm from them but there are many other sharks down there she's gog to have a fantastic ride all right  back to you but rest assured if we lose you I'm well I don't mean lose you like that I mean lose communications with you I'll be here I'll be your backstop as if we haven't heard enough about backstops but let's go back down to Anna 137 meters below Anna yeah don't lose me mama please don't lose me I thk Bris gonna take charge  that thank goodness you're here  the fal thg to troduce is the robotic camera down here I hope hear us talk about the ROV the remotely operated vehicle it is controlled at the mothership where Mark is by highly skilled pilots I have to say  there are ten lots  images  our submersibles  beyond  is also crucially the backstop  pictures as well because it is tethered to the surface unlike us down here for when our signal drops out from this sub is probably at will at some pot it's real very dependent on what the currents are dog down here  the technology  how we are communicatg is completely pioneerg  very challengg so when you do lose up as Mark said there to expect that marvel I pick up back on the ship  the ROV is not actually perhaps we can give it away that seems there behd us okay so Mike so I can't Thomas it just a thg you can't can't we  well mark showed you algebra so let's just put that shall we  the context  the Indian Ocean the necron mission which is what we are part  is happeng  these Seychelles  the western Indian Ocean the least explored yet the most threatened  the world's oceans  we're divg f our debris  idyllic at all 700 miles southwest  the ma Seychelles isl  maje were actually though closer to Africa some 00 miles away from others there  around 270 miles northwest  Madagascar the visibility here is amazg  the sphere  perspex gives us a 270 degree view you can look above you can look even below where our feet f  you can look left  right as we do all the time you must be very tempted to look around you all the time oh yes there's so many thgs  fact if you stay  one spot for 10 to 15 mutes you see somethg you never saw before we can also control the cameras down here as I said we are perched on a rocky outcrop there it is rechargg whoa yeah try some lights [] there we are we are literally hangg on to the seamount face the wall that builds up to the at all if you image this was an old mounta that has gradually sung to leave this enormous Lagoon  the middle  it you can fit there sizably fit Manhattan  New York  the middle  the lagoon above us  that's partly why we have such difficulty with the currents because at certa times  the day all the water floods out  all the water floods  thk it's time for a safety check regular safety checks down here the service topside topside Omega our current depth is four for three feet our headg is one Ner zero degrees like core systems are good [] a primitive leg out well we have to do that every 15 mutes so that top side as the submersible safety ficer is called can regularly keep  touch with where we are  that was very important as we descended wasn't it yeah we do regular communications checks with the surface part  that is a safety at that lose comms with us we have a set procedure we go through  eventually we'll go to the surface if you have a pregame absolutely  normally you'd be mappg the reef wouldn't you as you descend to try  check a transept a video for the scientists above  give them formation when they go back to wherever they're gog they're from all over the world aren't there the scientists up there  a remder too that we really don't know what is beneath 'less no one have got what puffed nuts this morng has ever been deeper than where we are  we don't know where what we're gog to see where would we're gog to shift direction suddenly now what is very important to remember here is that there are a number  zones people used to thk that it was just the shallows  then they would thk it was the depths  now gradually they're realizg that there are many stages  between the zones are changg so for example you get the scuba zone which is not 230 perhaps 0 if you're very experienced here it would probably be naught to 20 meters because there is no decompression unit here very difficult to get help so most people divg here if they're allowed you have to have very careful permits would only get to 20 meters the first  these zones then where the scuba divers go is called the alte photic zone known as the sunlit zone enough light penetrates this upper layer  water for reefbuildg calls to thrive it's also the most exposed to the impacts  human activity so the mixed own down which is where we are now is the Misa photic zone 0 meters to about a hundred  fifty meters the middle light zone it's called ten regarded as the start  the twilight zone at this level sunlight starts to dwdle corals become flatter  thner they are more likely to be plankton eaters than use the photosynthesis at the algae side them  here you beg to see the white tip reef sharks which I mentioned we saw just before we came on air you're more likely to see the potato groupers  I'm liberal it makes mostly some  those as well  you might see that this is perhaps a refuge from some  those dangers that I mentioned next is a new zone that people have found they thought beneath us the life would tail away with his very little light from the surface  it became creasgly difficult to see life beneath us but now confirmed  a previous negative omission  fact there is the rarey photic zone 150 meters down to 300 meters the term that scientists use to describe rare amounts  like rare fo take it our mission on the whole  this week's coverage  deep ocean live is to get to the bottom end  this zone to 300 meters the zone largely unexplored unlikely there are maybe thouss  mare creatures down there that have never really been seen before 300 meters is the maximum that this submare can dive to we don't want to do that but they are designed  pressure tested with some safety factors  there so it's actually been tested beyond 300 meters okay well let's talk now to our science correspondent Thomas Moore who has dug deeper at a very different Isl  fonse  understs these zones  the importance  them to science Thomas that perhaps you get the biggest or the greatest biomass up  the shallows but down here you start to see the sort  diversity that might provide all sorts  answers to life on Earth yeah absolutely  I mean it the textbooks would say that the greatest biodiversity the greatest number  fish  mare species would be  the shallows  that sunlit zone but I thk the more people do explore the deeper ocean the more their understg that there is an awful lot  life down there perhaps more life than the reason the shallows  fact  that is the threat that commercial fisheries are now attracted to the mezzo photic layer where you are where you get very rich fish numbers  those could be trawled  future before scientists have really been given a chance to underst what lives down there tens  thouss  mare species still need to be discovered down there  what you're seeg around you is quite exquisite you're seeg sea fans you're seeg sea whips are the forms  st corals  all around you it's snowg Anna that is mare snow that is comg down from the sunlit layer debris bits  food the other fish have left over  that is gonna fall all the way to the sea bottom but this much  it we snapped up by life below so it is quite an extraordary scene that you are witness to  if you went even deeper Thomas Trivedi perhaps he even beyond that to the abyss the difficulty for life down there is lack  oxygen very small amounts  oxygen no food as you say the stuff that's comg down will be gobbled up as it as it descends deeper no sunlight almost zero sunlight   course constant pressure this extreme pressure  low temperatures it's very difficult isn't it for life to exist as we go deeper  deeper to the ocean  I said I lost you slightly there with the communications but I thk you're talkg about the importance  lights to the ocean  it drives everythg on the sunlight zone you've got lots  corals which form these reefs different corals will grow at different rates some can grow at 25 centimeters a year others perhaps just a few millimeters but down where you are although you can still get reefbuildg corals because there's so little light they tend to change their shape so you'll get the same kd  coral same species  coral but it takes on a much flatter shape  a table coral it's called just to try  maximize the amount  sunlight but the algae side that turned that light to energy  feed the coral polyps what are you seeg down there Anna what are we seeg down here we're seeg very small fish you'd thk perhaps they were more like small mare fish Thomas we're seeg a large number  sea fans some a little bit difficult to see  this image way  presentg to you now but we will move around very shortly we're seeg some with coral a lot  th les  they're famous because they can't retract their tentacles if you image that coral is a food for large numbers  animals most corals try to whip  their tentacles certaly to get out  the way  parrotfish famously are they bite through coral with a fused front teeth  that is  fact what gives us our beautiful sy beaches  some  this debris we've had drop down I mean this red submersible is completely covered  that mare snow isn't it so at that is probably washed away from the coral at all  drops down on us has been quite amazg actually there the submersible there it is it's here okay so we've got the Yellow Submare movg  now  you've got a grabber arm on that haven't you what to use that for to two purposes  this mission we're usg it to collect samples for the scientists so they identify certa species that are dicative  the area that we're explorg  we collect the samples  which they process  the lab later the other reason is for selfrescue okay  what way if we were to become entangled we can cut a le or free up another submersible or earlier  the mission we can attach a recovery le to equipment that might found a sequel has that ever happened to you yes not gettg entangled but recoverg well I'm glad I'm glad to hear that's not gonna happen to you certaly it's absolutely fascatg down here I have to say that when we started this journey the submersible tips down forward like that it's quite amazg so it tips down  then we drop to all it almost a hole  light  you look back  it's as if the surface is a mirror image it's like we should be jumpg to it  not the other way around  then what has surprised me is that you descend through balloon it's just you it's the open seas they describe it as the desert  the oceans I was expectg to see fish straight away but is this strange solitary feelg when you're droppg down did you get that still or not every time it is excitg yet once you leave the surface  even if there's waves  that action like you described  the different layers once you're underwater it's smooth  then you're just lookg for the bottom  you know as you get closer to that that sea floor that's when all the life stuff starts to come by  check you out yes  certaly we've had the little fish as soon as we led on what was a sy bottom we have the little fish dancg around us to the sea  then here because it's such a steep sided underwater mounta what did you do then well we had a lot  downdraft  a lot  updraft so we were kd  fdg different areas gettg out  out  the current   we came  here to this rock we found this this neat feature little cave  front  us  we're just kd  hunkered  there   I actually grabbed onto the rock to try to rema stable yes  that was partly that was partly wasn't it to try  save battery how much battery do you actually have we have quite a bit if we're maneuverg a lot  usg a lot  thrusters it could be reduced to two or three hours if we do a lot  time explorg  just kd  driftg with the currents that are there we can stay down for about six hours  if somethg went wrong darrel ions if somethg went wrong we have a lot  methods to deal with that the emergency is to come to the surface but if we were to become stuck on the bottom  we have 96 hours  emergency life support four days four days  how would you be rescued somewhere like this 135 metres down well fortunately we have two other tools are on the mission we have ii submersible same def capabilities  another arm on that so they can come vestigate the entanglement they can hook up a recovery le they can try to have us the news  whatever we're  we also have two ROV which I believe can go up to 500 meters  it as well as a little grabber arm []   fact you can see the grabber arm on the front  the ROV certaly that allows it to get to a cage  so the little thg you can see at the bottom front  your screen that is the grabber arm  the the ROV  that gets to the cage that then is raised  the surface to get out  the way see looks like a syllabus  coral stuck to the top  it isn't it now where is that where's the other submersible goal I can't quite see it I don't feel mean how do you see them where are they terestg behd us that's all around see their lights anywhere no there might be just below us a little bit I have to say that we descend separately don't we  then we meet up below us no can't quite see them both no aga but it's very difficult sometimes  the gloomy lie to try  meet up isn't it it's quite difficult to to meet up under the water it is  fact today we descended together which makes a little easier stay together but we do have the trackg system on the ship so they have the ability to know what the position  each sub is  how to get us together it's worth potg out at this pot I guess that I am  fact the copilot that's true I can't fd the other submare that's probably our submersible rather which is one  the thgs I'm supposed to do isn't it if anythg happens to you then I would have to take over yeah that's correct if I was to pass out for some reason it's actually very simple to brg the submare to the surface there's two valves you open up  the air will start to go to our ma ballast tanks  you're on the way to the surface  we use the the sub radio don'twe they would you know what you pretend called an underwater tahoe Jennifer yeah  you can talk to the surfaces through water columns it's a hydrophone  the surface ficer has that list  emergency procedures to talk with you as well okay  I would say pilot asleep put on is that a nice way to put it seems to be how you'll practice aga yeah leave I'm brgg the summary  he fell asleep copilot ready to ascend would you md if it was an emergency you'd once the xray xray xray okay  they would know to do somethg up there would they yeah they know to freeze all the mare traffic all  those they prepare for the sub to come to the surface  come up quickly what are the elements that you need to keep an eye on when you're talkg to the surface safety ficer you've got depth pressure temperature all  these thgs why are they important  life it's important to give a consistent report as you can hear what the columns sometimes they go   out so havg that that study report  what depth are we what direction are we headg  our lifesupport systems still on  so we do those checks every 15 mutes tryg to see where they are can see some light where are they they're below us I thk underneath us let's look under our feet maybe they're under us no can't see you when I went to a left yeah they're still on our body below us  the importance  pressure obviously it's it's absolutely critical isn't it if you go a thous meters it's a hundred times the pressure 300 meters 30 times the pressure so if we accidentally got out  this right now what would happen to us well they're sold as he mentioned the pressure there's so much force on every little you know square centimeter  that hatch  fact if we were to undock the hatch you couldn't even open it every one  us puttg your shoulder to it okay well that's amazg isn't it Emily  the other submersible is down believes us now a little bit earlier certaly we had a visitor we were movg up slightly  there was a potato grouper who decided to come  say hello [] [] [] they're nosy animals why do you thk they come  fd us you know we're aliens  their environment so they come  they check us out  I thk they're just curious when he followed us up for what 200 feets do you thk how much is that about 70 meters he decided to rise to the surface more yeah I saw him first down beneath the sudden anythg I came up  was explorg  gettg right up agast the spirit absolutely brilliant now we were talkg about pressure temperature  every the need to be you know as you said you could push this up well I do have all these dials behd you because you also have a digital display as well yeah the digital display controls some  the lights but it's mostly for convenience a navigation for the pilot there's a lot  redundancy  the submersible so we do have analog gauges  a valve to be able to shut down any particular part  any  the systems so just from the top the green is the oxygen that's part  our life support  we are brgg pure oxygen to the cab at the same rate that we catalyze it to keep it at that normal level the black is the new ballast air that we use to distribute to the ballast systems that allows us to control our buoyancy underwater telephone you saw  then down the panel is the electrical  the only way to feel the true temperature  this is gettg really wet up here as many is to feel this  then you suddenly feel actually yeah it was quite cool cuz the rest  it feels really hot because it's such an enclosed environment yeah our acrylic sphere that we're  while it's great visibility it's a big sulator right so this this alumium patch we can feel directly with the water temperature I'm gonna draw yourself actually drips my rawater doesn't know that condensation is good that means the lifesupport system is workg okay okay well I'll leave it up its do provide  you do constantly dry ourselves f you don't really want waster  here when we're gettg  at the surface you're very careful not to let water get  like yeah I can't affect the performance  the scrubber  obviously electronics don't like seawater  each  the submersibles have slightly different scientific tasks to perform don't know easy so what what is yours I mean that moment will knocked on see I'm not sure you can quite see it but we're locked on just beneath that shot by your brother on rakhi service yeah the Omega has been set up for this mission as what we're callg the samplg stuff so we with the arm we're collectg samples at the direction  the scientists we also have water collection system to sample water different depths as well as the CTD which is monitorg the conductivity temperature  depth throughout our dive  then the camera with the feed that you're seeg that's our HD camera that allows us to actually film certa specimens  detail  I'm  the red sub here we've got Lucy  Robert  the yellow sub the different jobs as USA if we put our lights on even more committee that we let out her  everythg  then you can spot us  is that helpful when you get even deeper  an even darker yeah you know we navigate with the lights f a lot  the time because  the deep blues it's easier to see distance but once we get close to somethg we'll put on a lot  light  that brgs the color back to what we're seeg it makes it easier to identify the species  different thgs that were lookg at fantastic well  all  those elements as we mentioned earlier are taken up to the surface where there are all sorts  scientists at work right now Mark Aust is there  thank you very much Anna we take so much  this for granted don't we communications  on loud with GPS  satellites but  course all  that doesn't really work underwater so it's worth explag perhaps how we are how we are dog this  it is that we've got the two subs below us now at 120 hundred  thirty meters below the ship  at that level you know salt  pressure  the lack  electromagnetic waves means that that the traditional TV signal does not get through so a receiver has been lowered to between the subs  a where we are  fact so the subs then use LED lights LED lights are transmittg the beams up to the receiver audio  visual signals  then it's transferred by cable to the ship where we are  from here our satellite be a normal traditional television communication means satellite gets the picture to you well I'm joed by Oliver steed who's the head  the mission thanks very much for jog us I mean this seeg pictures like this live pictures like this has been a bit  a mission  yours  a dream  yours it has it's been a true you  I thk that's because there's two stories  the world about the ocean one is a negative one  we know what's happeng to our ocean we're sleepwalkg to a disaster at the moment  there's the other side which is just how wonderful our ocean is you know this is the blue planet  the beatg heart  our planet is our ocean  we need people to fall  love with it we need to spire people  it  I hope pictures like this can do that because if we can do that if people can fall  love with the ocean there's a hope that want to look after it  if they would look after a baby the politicians will be given a mate to act  act a lot faster than they need then they are at the moment yeah look we could have done this anyway why dabra i mean obviously it's a very special place but why out there  why why now so algebra is the Galapagus  the Indian Ocean but there's first there's been no research believe 30 meters here so we need to underst how the ocean is changg particularly Indian Ocean which is the least explored  one  the most one  the most unprotected oceans on the planet so what we're here to do is to try  gather that action that actionable data undertake a series  first descents  use that data to help form the Seychelles government particularly about their commitment to protect 30%  the ocean by 2020 that's an area about twice the size  the entire  yeah I mean it's protected Haven  many ways but you've been here we may be seeg the signs  damage from climate change  pollution we are yes we Don on the actual isl itself  our divers will see tomorrow as well plastic was washg out there we're also experiencg an El No  these parts as well the warmg ocean the antigenic heat that we produced is now gog to the ocean warmg it out the impact on the coral so support times try to establish a basele  those stems to see how that ocean changg how that's gog to affect the lives  livelihoods  turnf billion people deliver the nation's around the Indian Ocean thanks very much deed  it just extraordary gettg this television signal from Dowell  where Anna is an anime even have a spot  news for you down there [] I can't tell whether you fished I do apologize it's quite muddy sound down here now we promised you a news bullet from the deep from 135 meters down here we go then  there is no um apologizg for this no escapg bricks if news even down here our top stories here on    resa May will hold more talks with DUP MPs  her own backbenchers as she tries to gather support for her brexit deal the government has said there will be no vote  the House  Commons if it looks likely to lose to New Zeal now  the cabet has backed gun war changes  prciple after the Christchurch shootgs it follows the deaths  50 people at two mosques on Friday  there are calls for addiction to social media to be classed as a disease a new report by LPS wants more regulation to protect children from firms which they say are operatg  an onle Wild West well that is your news from the deep I'm pretty sure that no one has done that before so there you go another world first I thk we did another safety check don't wait topside topside Omega Omega reportg deaf four four four feet headg 1 9 0 degrees stationery life support is good [] [] good copy well don't forget if you want to get volved  this  they people really want you to because  showg the oceans like this with the remote operatg vehicle air comg both  these submersibles they really want people to see what the ocean is like do get  touch usg hashtag a deep ocean life  as well as beg on    on  Atlantic we're also on YouTube as well so fantastic way  gettg volved also remder too that on Wednesday we will be dog a question  answer session from the deep if you have any questions please do tweet us hashtag deep ocean live  if you've done anythg to pass on plastic hashed I pass on plastic is the way to let us know about that now can we talk to the yellow sub let's try hello Robert  Lucy can you hear us [] oh by the underwater telephone right let's try that Kensgton Kensgton Omega copied at four six ne on our starboard side [] hello Lucy this is such an excitg mission for you isn't it to be the first team ever to go deep f dabra atoll it must be an amazg feelg for all  you [] [] [] what have you seen so far to make you excited about the deep what have you seen so far down here to make you excited that this is a healthy environment for mare animals [] [] [] [] [] Wow [] [] is that because they are plankton feeders rather than leadg the light from photosynthesis from algae that live amongst them  if there was one creature that you would really like to see down here for yourself Lucy what might it be [] [] [] Lucy thank you so much for the moment thank you well we've certaly been lookg out for that barnacle there we go we'll turn that down so we can hear ourselves let's just remd you  the journey down here to 135 meters as I said this submersible tips forward doesn't it tips right forward you start enterg the ocean  you drop down through almost a circle  light as you come down droppg down through the blue  the ocean brighter blue even debt down here certaly until you get to the bottom  you're met with perhaps some fish if you're lucky if not  certaly earlier we were met with a dancg array  small fish extraordary journey down as a novice like me but I know you're probably a little bit more used to it every dive is excitg though around here it's a place I've never gone before the life is different  so it's always mean I thk we're gonna move soon I'm just gonna remd people that the technology is extremely difficult we're tryg to transmit pictures  sound usg light beams through water it's extremely difficult so shall we it'll take a bit  time I'm gonna let you just get ready to do that it's gonna take a couple  mutes for us to get ready to go all right just turn a couple systems back first one beg the air conditioner so we can see Kensgton Omega [] just confirmg you're clear we're gonna maneuver out  this location [] [] yeah cfee right behd us four five six [] [] negative unlights to stay just don't come behd us [] so just as you know that the postman the grabber arm turn out did you can see any  the deadly femoral papers  there holdg us to the moche surface will be harder particularly [] [] to make sure [] where's your song [] beautiful water [] I look up I can see the top  the rock the outcome [] [] get out the smoke me out Bob  you see probably the driver [] [] [] we're just movg [] the best way to describe it [] [] Oh [] [] look at this here Shailja beautiful you see for my papers no they've been takg [] [] alone 200 meters so it's very strictly controlled the samples that the scientists Oh [] [] [] which is fantastic desires [] yeah one  the thgs they've been askg us to do for eclectic  filmg when it sisted because the ones []  Thomas this is such an excitg moment or always to be movg around  the submersible [] [] I'm Thomas I know everyone on deck is that's what the losers creatures that we see down here [] [] [] [] [] we seem to describe difficulties [] [] is behd us [] see underwater mounta Wars  expla to the surface the small [] [] Rege communication shall we with Thomas More on the surface Thomas I have to say we can privileged to see a number  shots on our Burien side [] on the mothership you're very lucky to have seen that shark it's impossible to tell from this distance what it was but I can tell you that there are an awful lot down there with you it's a sign  a healthy reef sharks are what are known as apex predators are not the only ones down there there are groupers too that are big consumers  smaller fish on the reef why are the same many well because this is at the middle  a really strictly enforced mare protected area what you're seeg there is evidence that it works that these fish are given a chance to grow to an enormous size that there are plenty that there is plenty  food for them to eat  that's why the epic striated Predators will thrive it is a lesson to other areas  the world that mare protection can lead to quite extraordary mare life  that's the benefit for them  deed for us as we watch these pictures Thomas they're said to be about 19 species  shark [] especially [] species [] to [] [] []  is now beneath us once aga as we just we can see [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] [] never just to remd you this we have a team who've been the deepest ever  this part  the world that if you are a scuba diver  go to 30 meters around here perhaps only 20 meters because it is so [] yeah [] I'm 35 [] there's a lot  caves here  a lot  places [] [] [] [] []  sponges it's a bit like corals as well they are animals  certaly looks like [] [] 500 million years ago today [] our sponge [] this mission very confident [] see to check image [] we move along [] [] [] [] [] [] [] well there are wardens who are based on algebra over there one  them who is now joed the nekton mission [] [] [] there's a bit about those waters that we're lookg at right now she is from the Seychelles  she was actually the first Seychellois to take a dive like Ana bottg has now taken what do you make  what you're seeg just unbelievable because for someone who's been here for two years you will never actually image that this place is like deep down there is like so beautiful so much environment that you didn't expect it to be like back down there  the deep ocean is like so beautiful so amazg yeah it's unbelievable how many yeah  how I mean you went down the other day what was it like beg the first person from the Seychelles to descend to the depths like this it was just amazg the feelg was it was mixed feelgs it was just for the first time to ever be able to go down from like a scuba lower than that the scuba ft was like just breathtakg beautiful  it's just credible to see such thgs it was so calm so like you see fish is like just amazg yeah now you spent two years on dabra very briefly just sum up what that isl means to you just very quickly someone  came a home for two years it became a place that every day you woke up you wake you see the same place but it just it was somethg always do somethg new you always experience a new thg every day was not it was the same they are the new day yes but there was always somethg new happen if there was always that you go divg you always see somethg different even if you are gog the same spot but yeah it's just been a lovely place place that is close to my heart all right well Stephanie thanks very much you've just got a few mutes left  this extraordary hour so let's go back down to Ana somewhere down  the deep mark thanks very much deed down  the deep but lookg up actually  a shark that is still been circlg I don't know if the ROV can see those pictures it's quite murky for us to see we can't identify what type it is but fantastic to see the shark above us vestigatg  if we look above our head there all these ty fish that are just watchg us from above it's absolutely wonderful to   front  us  course the Yellow Submare with the Robert  with Lucy who are still vestigatg all the nooks  the crannies as we have been wonderful to try  hear side after all the creatures that might be livg there who knows some  them may never have been seen  already we know that carl's are used  cancer care like prostagl  so there's still so much to vestigate that may be used for Humanity that's why they need to be vestigated that's why the scientists reelectg mission are on this ship tryg to look more deeply at what is under what is  the deep ocean  what they can see I'm gog to show you the yellow submare aga there it is the lights agast the wall you can see how steep it is that it rises from the deep that the thermal currents that will farmer pliers that whip around these areas that's the difference is there between temperature  the ocean layer  the different layers [] we're float you don't even need the thrusters on the currents are good we're just about stutterg thank you so much for watchg us here thank you so much to Ry for takg us through  your world it's an extraordary place to be I have to say that's pretty much all we have time for tomorrow hopefully mark will be down perhaps gog deeper will assess perhaps the plastics that we see here  also on the isl  dabra plenty more from us down  the deep on deep ocean live thanks for watchg [] [] [] [] yes welcome to the Indian Ocean where we have just stopped where we witnessed a broadcastg first because about a couple hundred metres below me has been my colleague Anna bossg for the last hour I hope you've been watchg our the first ever live television broadcast from under the ocean  those are the pictures that we've been lookg at this is a live picture now  we've been lookg at some wonderful pictures  I hope that Anna body now aware that she's got to come up because they've been down for some time now but I hope that Anna can hear me because I want to ask her  be the first to ask her what that experience was like Anna I hope you can hear me still well it is entirely about broadly mark that's the only way I can describe it we just turned our air conditiong f so you can hear it better so we'll start to probably fill back  here quite quickly   fact this starts drippg ra on us as such as the condensation  this small perspex fear that we're  it is entirely otherworldly if I just changed my camera you can see what it looks like that is the other sub as submersible the yellow submersible with the prcipal scientist  it Lucy would rule  the pilot Robert Carmichael we've also been down here a little bit deeper epic now aren't we 88 88 feet down such about 10 Connor was skg slightly  moments we can get a little bit Neeraj  the the yellow submersible as we see  we can see them  there perhaps they can wave to us no they're lookg because we have just identified some cold that we've not seen certaly down here there Lucy's lookg around just wonderful but it really is otherworldly that's the only way to describe it first  all we've had a shark circlg around us for most  the program when you look up it's a beautiful blue color but when you look below it is a murky it's not blue it's not deep blue as I was expectg it to be but certaly here because the legality  dabra flushes out there is a lot  sediment that falls or perhaps that's why you get a sense  it beg a brown  other world is we can't show what it looks like down that's partly because we're right by this rock face I have to say it doesn't give us quite so much maneuverability  this really shows the geography  this call at all right  the middle  the Indian Ocean it is previous mounta is called a seam up now what would have happened is that the mounta itself would have begun to fall on descend  to drop leavg behd the coal that it made its home  certaly what they were expectg to see here is coral at different levels  depth  previous uncleanness ice ages were then a flooded post ice ages would have flooded  the sea levels would have risen  we're a little bit further out I thk that the mirror is currently flat now yes so we're seeg the old world mountas to the ancient the ancient mounta side here  the colors that have made this place their home the small fish  are you surprised gri by how many fish you see at a depth like this you know not I'm not super surprised what what trigues me is that a lot  these you expect to see  a shallow reef then we go deeper  they're down here it's amazg what life is where we've never been  done  these are extraordary aren't they look at these beautiful the light  our camera pickg out just beautiful yellow  presumg it's a Karl I don't know we've seen sponges as well haven't we  what is important to remember is that these are livg animals  need to look like the other like their clothes these are livg creatures that are probably on this rock face  order to catch the plankton  is swirlg around the ocean  is brought up from the as we move along with different colors  the from the the white light  the beach almost that has come down as Mare snow absolutely beautiful see these thgs that we've never seen before [] []  just above us all the fish the different sized fish that come to see us  swimmg  front the swimmg above [] what we're gog to do now isn't gonna have to start ascendg we've nearly got to the end  our battery life have who do you thk we need the power to take us to the surface what will happen is that you will eventually lose communications with us I don't know if the remote camera can see the lights above us I can't quite see it now that is a depressor connected to the ship  we are beg a light to that  that's how we are managg to communicators have to come really quite close to us today to try  see if we could get communication with the other submersible that will have to be pulled out  the way  as soon as that is Darw then you will lose communications with us but the remotely operated vehicle over there the remote camera which has been piloted from the ship's surface well hopefully follow us are all the way to the surface we currently that is 78 137 meters so you are hopefully follow us up as far as you can from a hundred  thirty seven meters down all the way to the surface  we'll see you then part two leave a mark see you shortly [] [] we'll hopefully see before this hour is out back on the surface I mean it has been quite a spectacle beg able to see Anna so clearly Thomas for our science correspondent here see her so clearly  here I'm not quite so clearly but at least we did we did here what did you I mean did you thk that would be what we saw I mean did you thk we could do it first  all it was a challenge defitely I thk the currents around here have been extremely unpredictable as they are around many  these enormous underwater mountas around a hundred thous  those dotted around the world but only a few dozen have been explored  we are the first to explore the seamount here  algebra but they do whisk these currents around because all that deep water is pushed up the side  the mounta it can cause an unpredictable current  also cause there was this enormous Lagoon  the center  here big enough to swallow up Manhattan you're quite comfortably all that water nearly all  that water will come out at low time spread around the isl that too makes the extremely challengg tensity yeah I should just expla to viewers where we are we're on a a supply ship  fshore supply ship  we're just about what four or five hundred meters f the f the isl it's actually on this side you can see it  tantalisg because not many people can go there you did you manage to stay the night there with the local Rangers who are workg on the isl just a few  them but he said it's a it's a an isl that's been protected from man by man hasn't it yeah absolutely emphatic so station run by Seychelles Isls foundation they have a team there who safeguard the wildlife there it is somethg which is where nature is is  charge not not humans although sadly you do see the effect  humans here  terms  climate change so you will see some bleachg  the coral here when the coral spits out the algae that it has side which it depends on for energy but what's remarkable  this is what I found yesterday there is some research on the isl which shows that the coral here recovers much more quickly from these episodes  rather than dyg which were happeng sadly elsewhere  the Seychelles it seems to be much more robust  that if they thk he is possibly because we are surrounded by this mare protected area there is no commercial fishg so there are plenty  herbivorous fish chompg away at the algae that would otherwise swallow up the reef that is crucial for what we see here  terms  fish life  the cold absolutely  what we can't see from pictures that is dabra but beyond that sort  reef there's because it's the second largest coral reef coral atoll  the world beyond that is this massive Lagoon what 16 miles by 5 miles or somethg which is the very central life  that at all  the water rushes through the let on the toll free with it all sorts  wonderful mare life yeah that's right an awful lot  sediment  sediment equals nutrients  where you've got nutrients you will fd an awful lot  life startg from the very small   course attractg the very big  this area does have a phenomenal number  apex predators these are animals which are the top  the food cha so thkg  sharks you thk your groupers  they're much larger than they would be elsewhere   much greater numbers just because the waters here are so rich let's just expla what we're seeg I mean these are pictures taken now from our remotely operated camera beg operated from just across the ship across the deck here  we are watchg the submare submersibles ascendg comg back   surely hopefully they will be back on the surface  Anna will be back with us but that that camera you can see just the front  it that camera is is what we're relyg on at the moment for these pictures yes deed now that is the the claw that remote operated submersible users  course to take submersibles  so on they were seen  the foreground there but that is one  these submersibles risg to the surface they do like to take their time they don't like to rush it they couldn't  an emergency come up   ten meters from great depth to ten mutes rather but they do for the comfort  everybody on board like to come up a little more slowly yeah now had we time durg the previous out we were gog to talk a little bit about what you've seen over the last well three weeks you've been on this boat just tell us a little about a little bit about what you've seen I  hammerhead sharks yes Andres I had all thumps which was the first isl group that I visited  I went down  one  the submersibles two to 200 meters  yes I did see an awful lot  life there I saw corals  course but also a hammerhead shark  I barely had time to get my my camera out before this hammerhead was right on me is somethg that I've always wanted to see this extraordary sharks with that great classic shape  the hammer at the front  it's got eyes on the end  it also seems to have methods  detectg the Rays buried  the s there  his head too  it gives it the almost stereoscopic ability to ppot the Ray  snaffle a while it's there they're very clever they can apparently detect the heartbeat fish hidg  the s yeah I see the right  then sharks do have this disability with their with the lateral les  also sensors  their  their heads do that they're able to almost have that sixth sense they've got very good vision good hearg to the spell  course as we know  also this ability google raise useful eagle rays  beautiful beautiful creatures a metre  a half across   course it's their their fs which have become extended  developed to wgs almost  they they fly almost like birds formation under the water  they   attract other fish to them hopg to pick f the scraps as they feed on some fish now I've never seen a sunfish yeah pretty big from a picture size yeah savvy I wasn't the one to see this you'll be talkg to the scientists shortly who did for the sunfish who did see that was blown away because it is so rare to see these thgs particularly under the water you do see them poppg around on the surface with their very high dorsal fs they're sometimes mistaken for sharks but it was quite an amazg thg just just to be swimmg very slowly past the submersible really enterg there well  before we just came out here everybody was talkg about the coelacanth I went to a laboratory  Oxford where they were talkg about the coelacanth which was a well as a livg fossil  a fish tell us about the silica so the coelacanth was thought to be extct they thought it died out sixtyeight million years ago but last century a few hundred miles to the South here down the South Africa the Mozambique  fishermen pulled up a coelacanth  its  its net  they immediately thought that this was a hoax that it could not possibly be true  yet we have Do fish that livg fossil now possibly  these waters the kd  environment we have here  algebra is very like the environment where we have now seen livg examples  the coelacanth this is such a strange fish it is the only one to have a three lobes tail it is the only one to have the begngs  legs terrestrial animal legs  its fs  the begngs perhaps  lungs  it's such an unusual fish we don't really underst where it lives we don't underst where it fits  to the family tree  life but it's there I mean is there a chance  them fdg new species do you thk most  on this trip almost undoubtedly mark the more you explore the deep the more you fd is probable that there are tens  thouss  mare species yet to be discovered these are unexplored waters  as you go deeper you will fd more you'll fd corals you'll fd fish your fee you'll fd other species too  really just the work dog here on the nekton ship is begng to catalogue that life for the Seychelles government you  just there fally on this now you may put a baited camera down a common thg to do it's a great great way  seeg mare life undisturbed by humans safer if a submersible or deed with scuba diver goes down there with a camera you're  course gog to get the teraction between that human beg  whatever they're sayg but if you put a baited camera down there you are drawg  mare life they build they smell they're the churned fish guts  the  there  the bait  it will come   you can capture that on camera we've seen sharks we've seen groupers it is quite an extraordary sight yeah  the pictures we're seeg now from under but  the depth are as I was sayg from the remote control it looks as though the submares oh no that one  the submares is still there submersibles is soon you can just see how steep that wall is mark that's the the underwater mounta we've been talkg about that rises four or five thous meters from the floor  the Indian Ocean extremely steeply  we don't really know what's gog on under the water because the last time this was plumbed with with lead weights  rope was 1800s  really we're only now begng to underst as we put out survey ships with proper sonar equipment look you'll get a much better idea  the shape  the seafloor around here  algebra yeah okay wonderful pictures there  thanks Thomas for the time beg  there's the mothership waitg now for the return welcome an apostle really wishg for the turn return  the submersible that brought you those wonderful pictures for the for the last hour  what you can see there is very terestg this is the depressor Nick always a receiver really  this is the bit  equipment that got you those pictures this is the bit  equipment that the the LED lights from the submersibles has to hit so that the receiver or depressor they call it can then relay the pictures by cable to this ship where we are  that is good news because that means that's the safe return  the  the receiver  that means we can use it aga tomorrow for deep ocean live  with me now is Rihanna Walton who is one  the scientists on on this trip Ravana thanks very much for jog us I should ask you first I suppose would it be made  the past hour or so watchg this have you seen it all before well I mean I've never seen up Deborah that deep so it's been credible I know a diver I know the shallow reefs I know down to 30 meters but I've never seen anythg that deep here so it's been credible experience to witness it you know live on TV seeg them descendg  seeg the changes  the reef is it gets much deeper so let's be clear it's a first broadcastg from that death but scientists won't have been at that depth  this area exactly so that because they asked on its own remote it's so far from anywhere it's very difficult to do any research here particularly underwater so this really this hole at all is relatively unexplored it's only the shallow reefs that we've began to underst  recent years but even much deeper we still don't know much about it  coral is your area  expertise you mean  the Seychelles for sometimes I know what is your view about the state  the coral at the moment so the state  the coral out Deborah is it's much better than it is  other areas  Seychelles so unfortunately we suffered a global bleachg event  2016  the the reefs  Seychelles workg quite hard  Irel suffered a large high mortality   coral but how Deborah did much more resilient so the corals here to show they're recoverg already  they weren't  they didn't suffer a high percentage  mortality like other areas  Seychelles right  do you thk what we fd or what you guys fe here will be a positive story because there are so many stories  coral beg impacted around the world how do you thk it'll be a positive story I hope that it will yeah  course I thk we've already seen positive stories around ever  the past  I thk it it kdly be a positive thg that were actually you gog to explore  underst the deep air is about ever now  that's always good for research  the question I asked Thomas little earlier why here why what is so special about this ecosystem so our demo is very special because it is so remote it's suffered far less time to purge any impacts that anywhere else  this region so there is fewer effects  pollution  human volvement so for that reason it's remaed a lot more resilient it also has a thrivg terrestrial ecosystem which also has which researchers found that both  those ecosystems together thrive a better underwater coral reef system as well okay  just fally just expla to us so you will go down you'll get some  the coral  what will you do with those samples how will it help you underst what is happeng here yeah so  the shallows were collectg some samples  st corals  hard corals  also even down to the depths we've collected samples  st corals  that has to get a bit  a catalogue  the diversity so we're lookg for those common species so we can understg  the the composition  species prompt sort  five meters all the way down to 200 bottg very close up  her submersible lookg very happy  why not because that is a wonderful wonderful experience that she has just gone through  let's have a look ready very well acquated with is my pilot for this mission Ry holt thank you so much for havg us what an extraordary workg environment you have it's amazg down here you know every dive is different  we get to go places where people have never been before expla where we are gog to change the cameras which I can do we've tucked herself to a crevice isn't 135 meters yeah we're kd  leang agast the edge  a cliff an underwater cliff we were fightg some down drafts  some up drafts  we got to this position so we just kd  parked ourselves on a Ledge  are tryg to stay stationary  I should give you a proper title  course you are an Aquanaut if an astronaut explores space you explore the deep yes you know where an ner space it's a whole new place down here  you know it's a 3d environment so we're always movg around we're gonna know where we are how how we're movg through the water column are we lighter are we duck the heavier all that that's exactly it's it's it's amazg to watch should with all the controls  as you said you're flyg these submersibles you're not drivg them  as you said the oceans make up 97%  the habitable space on planet Earth which gives you both a sense  the depth  the oceans but also that 3d environment that we have joed an expedition led by the scientist  the natural mission their aim is to perform a deep ocean health check  map  chart to sample to see perhaps what no one has ever seen before  even search for those rarely seen species literally  the shadows the dream perhaps  a sixgill shark or even a Celia camp the Do fish thought to be extct for millions  years  crucially to see what is happeng to that ten colourful coral as it faces unprecedented threats it is so important as habitat  home to millions  species the big question for the scientists is could the deeper ocean be a refuge from the dangers  climate change  even from a plastic pollution that we have talked so much about at sky well we are not alone down here this is someone the red one although it's been showered by this downdraft  sediment which you will hear the team refer to you as Omega out there we can see them is sub to the yellow the yellow ah yes the yellow one well we have the red what I've already done at which they called Kensgton should we see if we can raise them actually because  there is the prcipal scientist on this amazg expedition dr. Lucy Woodall from the nectar mission  pilotg her sub is Robert Carmichael let's see if we can raise them on the ship on the air sir yeah underwater telephone Kensgton Kensgton Omega come back I'm gonna pass the f day Anna to terview Lucy talkg about [] [] try aga try aga hello Lucy can you hear me hello Lucy can you hear us I was just askg you about the reasons you're tryg to explore the deep [] Thank You Lucy that's all I've tried  talk to you a little bit later thank you well let's go straight to these pictures we can see now from the from the remote camera  it is  the one  the submersibles  we are expectg them back any moment now so extraordary rollg gog on with submerse wasn't a submersibles good roll but they they certaly can  I'm joed actually by Pressor Louise lcock who is with the science mission here  there's a thg or two about this what do you make  these pictures I thk you'll probably fd it's the remotely operated vehicle that's rollg I've never seen this up roll but what do you make  the picture what we see  this morng I mean I I thk it's fantastic really we're  somewhere we've never been before nobody's ever been here we're lookg at a you know a fantastic new environment our job is now just to try  work out exactly what it is down there do a little bit  systematics check the species  coral so that we can catalog it all probably so we've got a lot  work to do later yes so you will be gog down  these submersibles or your members will  this is the way that you can pick up samples that's right one  the subs is equipped with them a stereo camera system so that we get really good video  we've got cameras  various places actually they're potg downwards potg forwards  we've got a set on the side as well  case were  strong currents  we have to sort  power along a wall  so we've got one sub totally equipped for the camera work  the other sub is equipped with the bio box on the front  the collectg arm  we have a permit to collect five specimen to the earth at each depth that we're workg yes I thk that that is Anna's son when I can we can see her they're preparg to make return to the to the surface which probably very pleased about she's had a wonderful trip I mean it is for someone like  they're gog down like this for the first time it is just the most trigug sort  other world I thk it's an amazg feelg I mean I've been  plans for almost 30 years  I had my first submersible time wagon fonzo  it was just credible that the sort  feelg  calm sittg  we were sittg on the bottom at 200 meters  then we just turned the lights out  all the fish came when it was just amazg I mean the serene scientists I just found it the best thg ever yes  you can't rush the ascent it's a fairly slow process isn't it I thk everythg is everythg is slow you know they don't go particularly fast the subs we don't need them to go fast because if we want good camera pictures we need a very slow transit so so they work perfectly for what we're we're tryg to get out  them yes well we expect her back  just a few moments say a pressor or coach just tell what is your role  all this so I came on board actually to brg a bit more experience with them camera systems  deep water operations so I mostly work with the deep water ROV f the coast  Irel I've got fundg from  Foundation Irel to vestigate the corals that occur  our deep waters we get corals down to about two  a half thous metres which is absolutely fantastic we work with camera systems you know these are complicated bits  care tryg to get transit thouss  them  fast currents a difficult thg to do  any somethg that I have a certa amount  experience   so I came on board to try  get get all this workg really  I thk we have you know we've developed protocols now that we're runng with the subs  very fast currents  we're gettg back the imagery that we need for analysis we've talked about it a lot but this place is especially rich obviously as  a rich ecosystem do you thk there will be new species species that scientists have found I thk it's almost certaly the case I mean some coral species have a global distribution  they put out you know larvae  these travel around the world  global kerat  there are some coral species that are really found all over the world  then there are other coral species that have very distctive distributions ten they even  the same ocean delimited by death so here 100 meters I get a different species  coral looks quite similar but it's this thg so the chances  us fdg new coral species here I would've 00 percent dabra so remote somethg here so quite a proportion  what's here Summer Sun will be global species but  some will be Indian Ocean specific species but but someone we knew okay well what we can see is at the bottom  that submersible  she is on the way to the surface so as a communication the receiver that we were usg to communicate is out  the water now so we can't communicate with you just see her  the what you can see  the foreground is the front  the remotely controlled camera  that is what is producg these pictures at the moment  she's about two mutes away from surfacg here  debaran so we hear a lot pressor about you know bleachg events  the warm waters impactg on the coral any sign so far about so I haven't lived on the surface Coral Sea there's a dive team gog out this afternoon to look at surface coral so really I look so far has been  the deep water corals  we won't expect to see such an impact here there's a thermic le here at about 70 80 meters just expla what a thermic le is so thermic le is where the temperature changes really suddenly so down to about 70 80 meters the temperatures around 28 30 degrees below there it drops steeply to them eight degrees  so  that cold water bleachg is not gog to be the same issue also once you get deep enough  course these corals they're  really deep water don't have the symbiotic algae that the shallow water corals have so there is some light at the depths we've been that today  fact the waters very clear  there's a reasonable amount  light but as you get down to 250 300 even 500 meters where we're gog there's less light  there different sorts  corals that wouldn't suffer completely the same way [] but you've been  these submersibles what's it live  it is a very conservative very ty other they are small there they are built for function non comfort should we say yes they can get extremely humid  there  fact one  my jobs that was to empty all the walls  the condensation from the air conditiong but even there that the ignition doesn't really work very well because they'd like to preserve the the battery life these this sub pilots so they they have it warm you get extremely dehydrated you can't stretch your legs  that's somethg that animal really notice even though she's apparently they're about fifty feet from the surface now yep so they will see a marked crease  the tensity  light now they'll be able to see the Sun pourg through the surface layer perhaps they'll be ventg an awful lot  air from the the submersible itself  as they rise they may be gog at the same speed  the bubble which is a very strange feelg that you are servicg that rapidly  then that dome will break the surface  there they will see  that picture really wonderful pictures aren't they to see the submersible addressed like that is quite extraordary  you can see the power  the Sun  it is that Sun that drives the mare ecosystem the more tense the light the greater the chance  course the coral makg energy  growg there says apparel for coral to that the combation light tensity  warm water can spell coral bleachg  there we are there is an abortion  her submersible  well done to the pilot Ry  I'm sure he's now communicatg with the little rib boat they've got f this ship which will go out  pick up Anna after what has been I mean I have to say just an amazg experience I'm sure for her she was very excited this morng certaly when she knew that this was gog to happen because  course there are lots  thgs that can stop these thgs happeng  have stopped these thgs happeng for sure  there this the wave conditions  course have been quite benign here but the currents have been the challenge really wherever we have been  the Seychelles  we are divg next to these enormous sea bounds they get very unpredictable very strong currents  partly because nobody has mapped the seafloor here  a hundred years so we have on board a team that is dog exactly that usg much more uptodate equipment back  the 1800's they were throwg ropes over with net weights at the end tryg to gauge the depth but now they're usg sonar  it is much more accurate  produces quite exquisite colorful maps very detailed maps  that will defitely be a legacy  this mission well there's detailed notes  there that are not washg is just puttg away she'll need those aga drk  water earlier  she will have deserved every bit  that but I have to say that this is worth still watchg because the very difficult maneuver about to happen which is our presenter gettg out  that thg  onto a rib which could be well they were typically the most entertag move  the entire last hour or so but  it's a serious pot so that are the rib has to go out yes the pilot will stay  the submersible controllg submersible  then how what they do is they pick up  I take out a back the pilot will eventually get out  then the submersible will be lifted crane lifted out  the water is that right it is deed so Anna the first thg will happen is that the hatch there will will open when the support diver is a sports swimmer is there on board he'll clamber on the back  a sub you can see the Front's are begng to submerged slightly below the surface but he'll clamber on on board he'll open up the hatch then Anna needs to stretch those legs that have been crumpled up for the last few hours st on her seed st on another console  then clamber up through that hatch  try not to lose her Bauman's mark as the waves gently rocked their submersible  then  course she will make her way down to the rib that you see there as they're gog f the back  our mothership liftg f the crane that took back that ship down that boat down yeah mate around watch how she does this because I've got to do it tomorrow because it's my turn down there tomorrow  I have to say it is a very excitg prospect which was a plastic plastic tomorrow the question impact  plastic tomorrow  Anna will be on one  these extraordary beaches where even here I mean even here one  the most accessible sanctuaries accessible isls  Indian Ocean very difficult to even hear plastic tons  it I'm told is washg up you've been there yes I'm so gettg plastic  I saw wildlife beg trapped  consumg it  that's the the peril for there we can hear the the crane just firg up driver gog to his cab  that is the the crane that will be liftg Anna's submersible out  the water thankfully not while she's still on board there you can see the the rescue swimmer they're just dryg f the the top  the the hatch because if you open that with the water still there all that would pour to the cab  the most sensitive electronics that have kept Hannah  Ry alive I have to say I never thought that  the bottg exitg a submersible would ever be alive television event but my suspicion well it's somethg isn't it what she's just done well you can see Ry side also dog the same to the rag tryg to dry it f so that she can make a slightly drier exit that she would have done otherwise yeah  my answer had Marcus yeah the longer they wait  there the hotter that's gettg because there  the other submersed will be comg up soon   they've effectively been down there yes how does the survey surveyg they have what they call stereoscopy but it's gog to be the transfer from the submersible to the rib the little flatable that comes along son hold on Anna please they ru this now that's quite rough isn't it so the flatable will come   you should see that any moment so here it is  now this this little sort  well I said how would you describe as a little shop but across or a boat  that so we're gog to stay together  not be separated by the Indian  the nations well you see the driver  the boat they're strugglg to get the right position yeah is strugglg over this a little bit so what do they do if just tossed out the magnet she's not he's got a little bit there Mare grabs the boat tenable at the TV sideshow this moment [] whew she's done it give us a wave  I forget to say no idea she's on live television but there we are so she is away she'll be brought back now to the ship  the pilot pilot will also exit exit now but these submersibles used as we saw durg that previous hour for a very serious pot they have these robotic arms they take the samples you put the samples  the submersibles  brg them up here for the scientists that we be talkg to to start with you yes because they're lookg for new species  the only way  dog that has been to the surface where they can actually do some analysis they can catalog those species  coral for the miature  the Seychelles but also they have lots  cameras onboard their submersibles at some pot afford somethg down they have what they call stereoscopic cameras as I was about to tell you before  those are 3d cameras where they can try  underst the structure  the rebreather  the complexity  that reef there's an awful lot  science that he's done as these subs travel on mother called transects marked distances along the reef where they will be countg life  also that the different species  life  that really is the kd  work that they'll be dog now  there you can see that they're begng to prepare the submersible for it to be lifted out by the crane Ry the pilot is still on board you can see him turng on his thrusters there at the back tryg to brg the submersible with range  the crane  there you see emergg there the the bottom the hook that Shane will then clipons those the ropes that he's holdg there above the glass dome  the submersible   your top left is on their way back  I can't work out Ry is gog to go on the that rib as well Thomas just for now thanks very much let's brg  our next guest talkg there with Thomas about mappg  surveyg the deep  that's what you specialized  that's what you do isn't it so yeah that's what we've been dog on on this FRC we've been hold on hold on if I see what it's done for fast rescue craft so it's normally used for my overboard situations but we've fitted out with all our server equipment so when we get to a location we go out first we survey the areas as Thomas just said before a lot these areas so it's a big it's really a bigger version  the flatable that we're seeg yeah exactly exactly that it's just a version  that  we're gog out  fdg a good area  a safe area for the substitue down yeah  your Ana mappg the the how deep the knew about some  the system we've got here that we've Teledyne mare  given to us we've we compact down to about 600 700 meters so we're gog from about about 600 meters all the way to about  or 5 meters so they're gog basically as far fshore as we can get obviously the subs  can only go to 300 meters  the rav goes down to 500 so you can see it all on computer here comes her Ry who was down there with there  with an opposg very experienced two submersible pilot 10 years an American guy who's leaner  actually put this submersible together for this trip he takes it apart  then rebuilds it so he certaly knows what he's highlightg  certaly knows about what he's dog  now the rig will brg Anna who has hard hat battle back on brgg out  Ry background to the ship  hopefully we'll be able to to see them reasonably soon yes are gog back to actually now there is the submersible no that is beg lifted [] back onto me behd us there extraordary mr. Kephart is a very fantastic have you been there anyone I haven't I've been out every day surveyg yes hopefully get a chance to or at the end well look as we watch these pictures  the submersible comg back we were just sayg so you have a computer all yes so you can watch what you're yes oh we see the 3d map  the seabed beg generated  real time as we're gog along that all generates on the computer  then once were fished we come back on board  we show that to the sub pilots  the ROV pilots  then from that forms where they're gog to do their dives obviously the areas are lookg for these thgs steep walls  they've been on today so yeah we were out yesterday surveyg that fd out where it is so we can get the ship  the right position  fd some good areas to their science I hope they treat this submersible carefully because that's that's what I'm gettg to honey this tomorrow so they don't come back thg down but they've got pretty good at it by now they have got pretty good at it by now yeah I'm sure okay well Mike thanks very much deed thanks very much  Thomas is back with us Thomas they'll be here a lot longer than we will how long do these missions last  you know what will they do with the formation they get well they're away for about seven weeks they'll be gog on from algebra to other isls outer isls here at Seychelles aga more sea mounts on these underwater mountas  they're tryg to underst they're tryg to produce a catalogue  life which is so important the Seychelles government has been ahead  the curve on mare protection that they really get it they have already protected 15%  their vast ocean territory that's the size  the   they're gog to protect another 15% so doublg it by 2020 but what they need to know is what do you protect what is so special what is so rare here  dabra to make sure that it is not destroyed by human activity from further afield whether that be climate change or pollution plastic pollution were deed overfishg these are the issues that can affect these waters  that is why they're desperate to protect the life with two big coral events fairly recently was  2000 1998 9:30  the 2009 2  3 2016 as well  what impact with those beg each bleachg event data called on there boy impact would they have had here  would the call  beg able to resist that here so they did affect coral here but terestgly the the coral here  algebra seems to have been more robust although an awful lot  it did bleach that's when it spits out is algae because it can't tolerate the hot water  it just shuts down  effect a bit like when we have a fever we don't feel like eatg well the same is true  the coral too so it spits out his food source the algae but what happened elsewhere  the Seychelles is that the warm water persisted  the coral died but here because it's  a mare protected area because there are many more fish feedg all the algae that would otherwise have smothered the reef that coral had a much better chance  recovery so it really has bounced back  that is why you see such abundant mare life here  is this general warmg will localized warmg or both that's a really good question it is general so every year  the summer  course you would get spikes  temperature here  the water but what is happeng now is that the background you like with climate change is creasg so it's comg from a lower trough  the peaks are gettg higher each summer  it's that summer peak which is gettg a much higher  at the time  much longer  that's what's causg the coal much more problem many more problems  particularly  an El No year that's that current  the South Africa South American which doubles up with climate change she'll be back on board which will be very good news after well quite a broadcastg experience for  well for everyone quite a broadcastg experience when they work we'll have seen that live for a while I have to say I was a bit  a skeptic I thought well they'll be cuttg back to us because the thg it was there wasn't it  we saw those pictures   Anna did remarkably well   there is oliver steeds all  us t2 is the head  the mission  he will welcome Anna back to the to the ship   I have to say I was talkg to her over breakfast this morng is she well she was sayg last night that she wasn't nervous  then this morng she admitted that it was all gettg a bit tense  then we she was about to get  the submare there was a storm  the distance  all those thgs go through one's md  there's a broadcaster you know you don't do these thgs very ten than they are they're exceptionally terestg  we're exceptionally privileged to do this but they are not challengg nevertheless  not somethg everybody would want to do let's be honest about it  but she's back   we're very happy about this I'm stg now with Paris Stefan artists who is one  the scientists at Paris the reasons I've just got you  here is because you have done this already haven't you beat down  you had a look  what did you make  the experience first  all I would like to say it's been an amazg privilege  X or e privilege to be able to dive  algebra yesterday was my first dive  a submersible it was an amazg experience we went to about havg 10 meters deep  we saw a lot  healthylookg ecosystems rich with st corals  fish so far it looks very good  I hope we will fd the same results  shallow  deeper reefs yeah you say it so far looks very good it all looks pretty healthy it all looks pretty healthy no signs  coal disease those times  plastic pollution  the depth we serve it yesterday  fish seem to be abundant with so many different species  sharks manta rays  so I thk so [] amazg amazg even comg to the surface is amazg because you're comg through surrounded by bubbles  they're gettg bigger  bigger  bigger  bigger next thg you know it's like you thk you're gettg rocked up  down  you pop out  the bright sunlight  you see the ship here  it still washg them down  you feel like you feel like from the depths up to the light  you feel that contrast yes all  it all  it usually different all the way through is right now I know comg up is you know what are the best bits I'm just sounds really strange I mean gog down as well cos you did it right eat it right down made that first  all  go down quite suddenly even then  then you drop through blue  it's just blue  you  I wasn't waitg to see fish straightaway but it's blue  you until you hit the bottom which is my sy yeah  then we are ridg deeper parts  rocky out  little communities to see SI phan small fish Hooper's gonna shock said clay bar from quite early on the shop didn't want to seem too but they go to vestigate who we are what we are they've never seen us before  we drop down to [] 175 metres we'll say well we thought that's what we thought with  yes but we can be heard just about but we kept communication yes exactly exactly I mean you see they put this plate down but with lights on there too to be right there so we can look up  see that quite clearly  it's not that the fish seem to my catcher  seven wdows yeah there's a shark checkg that out as well how did she believe that me because  is she nervous oh let's just work with yeah so I mean it's always excitg  then we did a dive yesterday but today was was the new is a new spy new environment yeah well then he was worryg me because we went down quite early today  I  he began to talk about us runng out  mushrooms before we actually go on it said that Devorah me so we parked our selves up as best as best we can  a rocky I've got the grabber arm out to hold up  Soraka state Lucy will emerge with samples  she's been dog serious science down there  we'll be usg that for even the cameras to see the enemies perhaps to see the coral  all  that's beg reported  then that will all go to a database  properly analyzed so the science is gog on even with the cameras on I'm sure we can laser there's a highlight especially when you can see the other sunrise when it's lights on up agast this really craggy stable that's when it feels otherworldly  you you see what you must look like because you're just  this lovely pollen from 270 degrees sphere Plus begs me to see so much  then you see what you must look like when you see themself you still get this bug like aliens over 30 seconds left on the program your highlight what was the best moment here [] that one always a shot we had 30 seconds we've now got 20 second always the shark  oddly the journey I tell you what it was I thk it was right at the begng well here we are it was lovely  it was broadcastg first  so many ways  it was a wonderful job very well done  you can see all the highlights on the sky tonight we're back tomorrow 8 o'clock Chese style antics   calm  that is it  the Indonesian []
113,0.0,"[MUSIC PLAYING]  . This is BIO 150, isn\'t it? OK, just wanted to make sure. So we start f with a scenario. 0yearold guy\nquiet, suburban life. Married 15 years,\ntwo kids, 3.5 dogs. Everythg\'s stard. Everythg\'s gog wonderfully. And one day out  nowhere,\nhe punches somebody  the face at work. Totally bizarre,\nout  character.  guy is stg\nthere by the water cooler  makes some comment\non some baseball team, takes exception to it,\npunches him  the face. Utterly strange. Thgs are quiet. Three months later, his wife\n 15 years happy marriage discovers he\'s havg an affair\nwith a 16yearold checkout kid down at the Safeway. Really weird. n three months\nafter that, he absconds with all the money at work,\nembezzles it, disappears,  is never seen aga. Three possibilities. First one this guy\nis a  deep creep. Second, he is havg the\nmost immature midlife crisis you could ever image. Third possibility\nhe has a mutation  one gene  his head. And what we will\nbe seeg is this is exactly the\nprile that you get  a certa\nneurological disease where it\'s one gene\nthat\'s out  whack. First demonstration  that. OK, just to get a\nsense  who\'s here, how many  you thk there\nis a genetic fluence on sexual orientation? OK, how many thk it is\npossible for prenatal events to fluence your political\nopions 30 years later? OK, how many thk that there\nis a valid way  usg biology to underst who\'s\nreligious  who isn\'t? Not quite as many hs there. OK, as long as we\'re\n that terra, how many people believe  God? How many people\nbelieve  souls? How many people believe  evil? How many people\nbelieve  free will? That\'s gog to change. [LAUGHTER] Oh, I might as well ask. Is there anybody \nthis room who actually does believe  evolution? Just wanted to make sure. See what we\'re\ndealg with here. OK, how many thk that\nthere is a genetic fluence  that there is a basic\nbiological difference, sex difference, \nlevels  aggression? How many thk there\'s\nbiological basis  sex differences  telligence? OK, who thks it\'s all\nexplaed by nature? Who thks it\'s all\nexplaed by nurture? Who thks there\'s a\nmagnificent, fascatg, nuanced teraction\nbetween nature  nurture? [LAUGHTER] Yay. OK, well everybody\'s\ngog to get an A+ then. You already have the\ncourse under control. So we start f tryg to\nfd somethg  common. Look at these four\nevents here or not,  terms  beg\nscraped out there. But these are four\ncircumstances that have somethg surprisg  common. Havg your period. Havg a bra tumor. Eatg a lot  junk food. Takg anabolic steroids. Those  you who\nare not oriented to with, that\'s the ones\nthat build up your muscles like testosterone derivatives. OK, these all have somethg\n common havg your period, havg a bra tumor,\neatg a lot  junk food,  takg a lot \nanabolic steroids. Anybody want to fathom a\nguess what\'s the commonality amongst the four  them? Yeah. Hormones? Hormones. Good. OK, we\'re f \nrunng with hormones. Good. Even more specific than that. Somethg they all\nhave  common. Oh, come on, somebody\nwant to guess? I see these brief\nmovements  hs there as people\nchange their md. OK, it all has to\ndo with hormones. y all have\nhormones  common, I say, tryg to facilitate\nsomebody makg the next guess. Oh, come on. y all have somethg. OK, we gotta get outta\nhere at some pot. se all have four\nthgs  common. l  these have been used\nsuccessfully  courts  law to expla the\nbehavior  a murderer. [LAUGHTER] In the first case,\na number  cases where the fact that\na woman was havg her period at the time\n killg someone was part  what a jury said led\nthem to exonerate the person. A literature showg that\na disproportionate share  female aggression comes\naround the time  menses. Next one there is an area \nthe bra you will know so much about over the next three\nmonths called the amygdala that has somethg\nto do with aggression  has somethg\nto do with fear. And you get a bra tumor\nthere,   a number  cases, you get someone who is\nuncontrollably violent. And this has also been used\nsuccessfully  a court  law. Junk food any  you who are\nSan Francisco history buffs will know 20 years\nago, 30 years ago that Dan White, a\ndisappoted fice seeker, assassated the mayor  San\nFrancisco along with Harvey Milk. And as part  his\nremarkably successful defense for a double murderer that\nled to a remarkably short jail sentence, was the\nfamed Twkie defense.  argument that his\naddiction to junk food caused wild fluctuations\n his blood sugar levels, which caused him to do that. Fally, anabolic steroids. Any number  cases  people\nhavg uncontrolled violence argug because they were\nweight lifters  a wildly abusive range \ntakg this stuff had somethg to\ndo with violence. Put all four  these\ntogether,  we get the first  the two\npots  this entire course. Which is, sometimes the stuff\nthat\'s gog on  your body can dramatically fluence\nwhat goes on  your bra. Second critical pot tonight,\nwhen you\'ve settled back down,  you\'re ready to go to sleep,\n you\'re nice  relaxed,  your heart\'s\nbeatg nice  slow, thk the followg thought. You know, that heart isn\'t\ngog to beat forever.  about your lips\nturng blue after.  about the blood\nflow slowg down.  about your feet \nyour toes gettg cold. And at that pot,\nyou will probably be creasg the rate at\nwhich that heart beats. And you will have just\nseen the second key thg  this course,\nwhich is sometimes what\'s gog on\n your head will affect every sgle\noutpost  your body. And what this course is\nabout is the tertwg, the terconnections\nbetween your physiology  your behavior the\nunderlyg emotions, thoughts, memories, all \nthat,  the capacity  each to deeply fluence the\nother under all sorts  circumstances. Now, what we\'re gog\nto be dog with this is tryg to underst\nthis under fairly difficult circumstances. If everybody here was\nhere because they really wanted to underst why\nall the wildebeest on earth mate  the same\nweek each year, we\'d have a fightg chance\n figurg that one out. But that\'s not what\nwe want to underst. We don\'t want to\nunderst why birds migrate  don\'t get lost. We want to underst\nhuman behavior. Worse than that, harder than\nthat, human social behavior. And hardest  all  some\ncases, some grossly abnormal human behavior. And if you\'re gog to\ntry to do that, there is a problem which is,\nficially, it\'s complicated. It is a huge, messy\nprocess tryg to make sense  the biology\n human social behavior. And just as all\nsorts  realms when one deals with messy,\ncomplicated problems that you need to thk about\n some wildly teractg way, we all have a strategy\nthat we come up with. A strategy to make\nthgs easier which is that we thk  categories. We thk  categories. We take thgs\nthat are contua,  we break them\nto categories. And we label those categories. And we do that \nvarious settgs because it could be\nextremely useful. For example, somebody give\nme an estimate on how long this le is. [INAUDIBLE] A foot. OK, people who said a\nfoot, what is it that went through your\nhead to figure it out? You imaged how\nlong a ruler is. Is this 11.5 ches because \nit\'s 11 ches an 8.5 by 11. But everybody  here has this\ncategory  their head thgs that are kd  the\nsame length as a ruler. A contua  lengths, \nthere\'s a category for that. Suppose I\'m tellg you I have\nsome friend who\'s a runner. He runs the mile. He\'s credibly fast. In fact, he\'s one\n the best runners  the country at this pot. How fast does he have to have\nrun the mile or better for you to be deeply impressed? Under four mutes. And thus, we have another\ncategorical boundary there  there\'s an\nfite variety  speeds with which you can run a mile. Yet we have  our heads\nthis boundary people who are under four\nmute milers, you are very impressed with. OK, now I want to impress you\nwith another friend  me who\'s a pater. And this person is\nsuch a great pater that they pat with\n11 different colors. That doesn\'t work because that\'s\nnot a category that we have. We don\'t classify the\nquality hopefully not we don\'t classify quality\n patgs along those les. But we beg to see here\nis  the right areas, we have categories that\nwe impose on thgs that are not categorical. Here\'s an example. Why should you do this? Where\'d the example go? Here\'s one  the\nclassic contua that we ever deal with, which\nis the contua  color the varyg wavelengths that\ntake the rabow from violet to red. And there\'s an fite\nnumber  spaces  between. And what do we do? We have rules  English that\nyou can divide the contua here  here, or whatever, \nthat\'s what you call a color. This is red. Everythg from here is red. Everythg here\nis orange, so on. You take a contua,  you\nbreak it to boundaries. Why do we do that? Because it makes it easier to\nstore the formation away. Instead  rememberg the\nabsolute features  somethg, you simply say, it\'s a. It\'s a subfour mute miler. It\'s a le that\'s about\nthe length  a ruler. It\'s the color orange. How do you know that\'s the case? Because go  take people\nfrom other language groups, where their language\narbitrarily divides the rabow at other pots with completely\ndifferent color terms,  they remember different\npriles  colors differently than an English speaker might. Take a color. And if the color comes right \nthe center  somebody\'s color characterization,\nif it comes right  the middle  the range\n what counts as that color, people remember whether they\nsaw that color or not far better than if you show them a\ncolor at the boundary. And people will show that as\na function  what language they speak. Takg a contua, \nyou break it to pieces, because it\'s easier to\ndeal with the facts. Another example  it. Here we have four objects. And as drawn here, simply\nbecause we have categories to describe the\nfirst three, do one  those tests  show\npeople a bunch  shapes,  they come back an\nhour later  ask them, Have you seen this shape before? And people are gog to be\nfar more accurate with this than whether they saw\nthis or not because we don\'t have a word for it. We don\'t have a word that\'s\nat all sort  analytical that some squiggly whatever. We don\'t have a\nclear cut category. g  categories\nmakes it easier for us to remember stuff. And it makes it easier\nfor us to evaluate stuff. So that\'s a classic\nsort  response that we have cognitively\nto complicated thgs. But there\'s a bunch  problems\nwith categorical thkg. First example\n first one you can see from a realm \nlanguage differences  that not only is there a\ncontua  fite number  wavelengths, there\nis a contua  sounds that humans can make. And different languages draw\nboundaries at different pots as to what count as similar\nsounds or different sounds. re\'s like two different\nTH sounds  English, which apparently we\'re\nnot very good at hearg. But there\'s other ones we are. And that will\naffect your ability to remember stuff what\nword it was dependg on whether it is on a dramatically\ndifferent boundary, whether it is a sound that sounds\ndifferent to you or not. Example  this apparently\n Fnish, people do not differentiate\nbetween the sound  a B  the sound  a P, whereas\nwe have no trouble with that. But people from Fl do\nnot make that differentiation. And I discovered this\none day a number  years ago where, for reasons\nI don\'t even underst, I found myself needg to\ntake to testicular biopsies on baboons. Not havg sort  learned that\n junior high how you do that, I called up this guy at\nurology the med school who happened to be Fnish. And I explaed to him\nwhat I wanted to do. And he sort  took\nme through the paces  told me what thgy I needed\nto buy,  that sort  stuff,  holiday packages  those\nwhere you can get a dozen. And sort  tellg\nme how to do that. And once we went through he\nsaid, What I want you to do, the thg to do at this\npot, is get some practice. I want you to\npractice on a bear. [LAUGHTER] And I said, What? He said, Yeah. Practice on a bear. And I said, Are you kiddg me? He said, I know. I know it sounds crazy, but we\nhave all the residents do that. It\'s a very good\nlearng device. Either practice on\na bear or an apple. Oh. Oh. Here we see the dangers\n makg mistakes about differences between B \nP under certa circumstances. So we see one \nthe dangers there, which is when you are payg too\nmuch attention to categories, you can\'t differentiate\ntwo facts that fall with the same category. Next example. I remember back at various\npots  anxiety durg exams,  such back when\nwhere there was a world  difference between\ngettg a 65 on a test  a 66 on a test. Not particularly different. But because there is\nthis boundary drawn there between passg  failg,\nthere is this dramatic differentiatg we make. When you put up\nboundaries, you have trouble seeg how\nsimilar thgs are on either side  it. Next example, one\nadditional problem that you get when you\nthk categorically. And for this,\neverybody needs to turn over one  the\npieces  paper the paper you\'re gog to\nh , the questionnaire. And what I\'m gog to do is read\nyou a series  phone numbers,  I want you to write them\ndown as accurately as possible. OK, ready? 23269, 6503260, 2565779,\n83229, 2913171, 231026, 59329, 73880, 8315287. OK. Now what that\nexercise is  no, that doesn\'t count\ntowards the grade. What that will\nshow, I\'m sure, when  some obsessive burst\n procrastation I actually look\nthrough the answers tonight, what it\'s gog\nto show is the accuracy is gog to tank the second\nyou go from the phone number pattern  three digits followed\nby four, break up that pattern. And suddenly we all get screwed\nup because we\'re sayg, Wait a second. I thought it was a phone number. That was one digit. Now two digits. I can\'t. And it\'s gone,  you\'re\non to the next one. And what we see there is\nthe third example, which is when you pay too much\nattention to boundaries, you don\'t see the big picture. l you see are categories. l you see are, Wait\na second, phone numbers are supposed to come with\nthree digits followed by four. Another example where we\nuse categorical thkg. OK, I\'m puttg up a\nnumber series here. OK. What\'s oh, my god. OK, what\'s the next\nnumber  this series? And why? [INAUDIBLE] 2. How come? [INAUDIBLE] OK, so we\'re kd  oscillatg\nall over the place there. OK, so that\'s as valid\nas anybody else\'s. Who else has a next\nnumber  le there? [INAUDIBLE] What\'s that? [INAUDIBLE] 5. How come? [INAUDIBLE] OK. Are you gog to take that? 5. That\'s very OK. What else? Let me make it a\nlittle bit easier here. OK. So what\'s the next\nnumber  that series? And what I\'m tellg\nyou is if you thk about the world with a certa\nset  categories  your head, you will know the next\nnumber  the sequence. So what\'s the next one? [INAUDIBLE] Seven billion. [INAUDIBLE] OK. That one. OK. Seven billion. That\'s another possibility. though presumably, it\nwould be seven billionth. Anythg else? Any other guesses here\nas to what happens next? th, 1th, 23rd, 3th. What\'s the next one\n the sequence yes? [INAUDIBLE] . How come? [INAUDIBLE] OK. But remember, it\'s\ngot to be th. What\'s that? Ordal? Cardal? Whatever it is. What? 2nd. How come?  subway? You were right. You were right. Anybody who is a New Yorker\nwill know what the next one is. se are the subway stops. And you get a bagel\nwith cream cheese. [APPLAUSE] So you get New Yorkers,\n while everybody else is thkg logical thgs\nlike 3,  1,  5,  seven billion,\n all  that, you\'ve got this whole world\n dividg numbers by. Subway stops. We thk  categories. We thk  categories. But as you just saw,\nthere are these problems. First one beg, when\nyou thk  categories, you underestimate how\ndifferent two facts are when they fall  the same category. When you thk \ncategories, you overestimate how\ndifferent they are when there happens to be a\nboundary  between them. And when you pay attention\nto categorical boundaries, you don\'t see big pictures. Now, what our goal  this\nclass is gog to be is thk about this\nbig, complex issue  the biology \nbehavior without fallg to thkg  categories. What do I mean  this regard? g categorically\nabout a subject like this? re\'s some chicken. And the chicken is\nstg somewhere. And there\'s some\nrooster over there that does some sexually\nsolicitive, excitg thg for the female. And  response to\nthat, the female picks up  goes runng\nover to the rooster. And thus, we have our first\nbehavioral biology question here. Why did that chicken\ncross the road? To get to that rooster. So you could answer that\nlike an endocrologist  say, Well the female had\ncerta levels  estrogen  her bloodstream, which\nmade this key hypothalic areas responsive to the stimulus. Or you could answer\nit like an anatomist, sayg, Well, because\nthe fulcrum  her pelvis or whatever it is chickens\nhave that allow them to run. Or you could answer\nit  the category  an evolutionary biologist. That over the\nmillennia, chickens that didn\'t respond to sexually\nsolicitive gesture from males left fewer copies\n their genes. And there\'s all these\ndifferent categories that we can use to\nexpla what\'s gog on. l  these different buckets. l  these different\nbuckets which beg to pull you towards all\n the problems we just saw. Now, havg trouble tellg how\ndifferent or similar two facts are. Havg trouble\nseeg big pictures. Over emphasizg the\nimportance  the bucket you happen to live side . And thus, suddenly everythg\nabout this behavior is explaed by a gene, a\nneurotransmitter, a childhood trauma, a livg\nside one bucket. Whet we are gog to be\ndog over  over  here as the ma pot  the course\nis lookg at how what goes on  your body fluences\nbehavior, emotions, memories. How what goes on there\nfluences your body, loopg over. And at every one\n those pots, resistg the pull to\nthk categorically. Oh, this is the explanation for\nwhere this behavior came from. Here\'s what we\'re gog\nto be dog stead throughout  terms \nthe structure  the class when we get to actual behaviors. For each behavioral\ncategory, we will start f by lookg at what the\nbehavior looks like. Because ten, that takes\na lot more objectivity than we itially assume. What does the\nbehavior look like? n we will say, Well, what\nwent on  that organism a half second before\nthat behavior occurred to cause it to occur? Which is the world  what\'s\ngog on with neurons. What\'s gog on with circuitry. Where\'s the explanation\nfor the behavior. Aha. This behavior happened\nbecause this part  the bra got activated. But just as we\'re about\nto settle  happily to that bucket,\nwe push back a bit  say, Well, what\nsmell, what sound, what sensory stimulation\n the environment caused those neurons\nto get activated  produce that behavior? And then pushg one\nstep further behd. OK, well, what do hormone\nlevels, various hormones  the bloodstream \nthat animal or dividual for the past few hours,\nhow do those hormones change how sensitive you\nare to those sounds, smells, et cetera, that\ncause those neurons to get activated \nproduce the behavior? And all we\'re gog to be\ndog is workg our way back, all the way through early\ndevelopment, fetal life, the genetic makeup up  an\ndividual, the genetic makeup up entire populations, species,\nthe evolutionary pressure on, all the way back to there. How do you expla each\none  these behaviors  the context \nthose outposts? And how are they\nnot really outposts? l they are, are different\nways  expressg the same biological fluences. If you say, Ooh,\nhere\'s a hormone that explas this behavior. This behavior is caused\nby Hormone X. Hormone X is coded for by a gene. So suddenly you\'re not just\ntalkg about endocrology. You\'re talkg about genetics. And if there\'s a\ngene there, it has been the subject to selection. So suddenly you\'re\ntalkg about evolution. If you were talkg about what\nsmells, sights, et cetera, are the acute triggers\nfor a behavior, by defition\nyou\'re also talkg about fetal development\nthat determed how sensitive those systems\nwere to those sorts  stimuli. What we\'re gog to be\nhavg over  over aga is any one  these buckets\nthat we spend some time , all we\'re gog to do is thk\n that bucket is at that pot the most convenient\nway  describg all  the fluences\nthat came beforeh. And  that regard,\nthere\'s no buckets. l they are, are\ntemporary platforms. And each platform is simply the\neasiest, most convenient way  describg the outcome \neverythg that came beforeh startg with millennia\nback  evolution. OK. So that sounds great. That\'s what we\'re gog to do. We\'re gog to do this. And we\'re gog to be very\nsophisticated  fancy  our thkg about it. And we\'re not gog to fall\nfor categorical thkg. OK, this is a complicated\nsubject,  we\'re smart. So we\'re gog to try to\nthk about it smartly. That\'s great. But like maybe this is just an\nirritatg song  dance here , Ooh, we\'re not gog to\nfall for categorical thkg like people out there. Obviously when\npeople are thkg about stuff like behavior, \nthey do this pressionally, pressional biologists, yes,\n they underst also. This is just the strawman. Ooh, we\'re gog to be more\nsophisticated  our thkg than endocrologists, \ngeneticists,  all  those. y obviously know that\nthese thgs teract,  there\'s not just\none explanation. And it\'s just the\narea they focus on. y underst that. Let me read you a\nfew quotes to show just how much some  these\nfolks don\'t underst that. First quote. ""Give me a child at birth\nfrom any background,  let me control the total\nenvironment  which he is raised,  I will\nturn him to anythg I wish him to be\nwhether doctor, lawyer, or beggar, or thief."" This was John Watson, 1912,\none  the foundg fathers  the school  psychology\ncalled behaviorism. Behaviorism that sort\n reached its apogee with this guy BF\nSkner  the 1950s. This notion that if\nyou could control the rewards, the\npunishments, the positive, the negative reforcements,\nyou could turn anybody to anythg you want,\nwhether doctor, lawyer, beggar, or thief. And we know that isn\'t the case. We know that\'s not possible. We know that. l you have to do is\nthrow  one other factor  like a lot  prote\nmalnutrition durg fetal life,  you\'re not gog\nto be able to do that. That beg a crude example \njust how wrong this guy was. You cannot have all the control\nover the environment  turn somebody to whatever you want. Here\'s a guy livg\npathologically  this bucket that behavior could be explaed\nsolely by understg reward  punishment. Interestg factoid\nthis John Watson guy. Shortly after that,\nhe was driven out  academia for a wild scal\nthat he was volved . And he spent the\nrest  his career apparently as an extremely\nsuccessful advertisg executive. Gog to show you\nsomethg he may not have been able to turn\npeople to anythg he wanted, but\napparently he could make them buy all sorts\n geegaw nonsense. OK, next quote. ""Normal psychic life depends\nupon the good functiong  bra synapses."" If you don\'t know what synapses\nare, don\'t panic at this pot. y\'re ways bra cells\nconnect with each other. OK. ""Normal psychic life\ndepends on the good functiong  bra synapses,\n mental disorders appear as a result  the\nsynaptic derangements. Synaptic adjustments will then\nmodify the correspondg ideas  force them to\ndifferent channels. Usg this approach, we\nobtaed cures  improvements but no failures."" Synaptic adjustments. What do you suppose those little\nold synaptic adjustments are that this guy is referrg to? Any guesses? [INAUDIBLE] Somebody shout it out. [INAUDIBLE] Electroshock therapy. Electroshock therapy you\nknow, a little synaptic. You wish it were as gentle\nas electroshock therapy. This is even more dramatic\nsynaptic adjustments. Any other guesses? [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, frontal lobotomies. You want to adjust\nsomebody\'s synapses, so you slice f the front\nthird  their bra or so. This was Egas Moniz, a\nPortuguese neurologist who vented frontal lobotomies. It had a different\nname at the time. But was the person\nwho started this,  somethg that was done to\ntens  hundreds  thouss  people who had absolutely\nnothg wrong with them. One  the darkest chapters\n where psychiatry gets  bed with ideology. Massive crimal destruction\n people\'s bras. This is what he had to say about\nthe procedure on his acceptance  his Nobel Prize \nPhysiology  Medice for havg vented it. So here we have\nsomebody pathologically livg  a world  underst\nhow synapses are workg, adjust them. And with that, we obta\ncures  improvements but no failures. Fal quote. Worst one  all. "" selection\nfor social utility must be accomplished by\nsome social stitution if mankd is not to be\nrued by domestication duced degeneracy.  racial idea as\nthe basis  our state has already accomplished\nmuch  this respect. We may,  we must, rely\non the healthy stcts  the best  our people\nfor the extermation  elements  the population\nloaded with dregs."" Anybody want to\nguess who that was? [INAUDIBLE] Hitler? Hitler, that\nbehavioral biologist. He was a little bit\nbusy at the time. This was stead one  Hitler\'s\nma scientific propagists. This was somebody livg\npathologically  a box a box that doesn\'t even\nexist havg notion  race,  ethnicity, \ngenetics,  all  that, sayg let me fix that one. Let me extermate the elements\n the population loaded with dregs,  I\'ll fix up\nthat little problem  fixg somethg that a\'t broken. Who was this? This was a scientist\nnamed Conrad Lorenz. Conrad Lorenz, who probably a\nlot  us are familiar with. Conrad Lorenz was one  the\nfoundg fathers  ethology. We\'ll learn all about that. But he, like everybody\nknows him wdg up  all the little\nkid nature books, Conrad Lorenz discovered\nimprtg  birds. And he\'d be gog around. He was this little Austrian guy\nwith this cherubic white beard. And he\'d always have these\nlittle Austrian shorts  suspenders. And there would be a whole\nbunch  duckies followg him because they thought he\nwas mom,  he was totally charmg  irresistible. This sort  old imprtg\nwith his ducky kids. And he also happened to be a\nrabid Nazi propagists who went to his grave\nsayg that there was nothg wrong with what he did. se are not crappy,\nfourthrate scientists. se are not people workg\nat the   the Desert  Podunk or whatever. se are among the most\nfluential scientists  the last century. se are people who fluenced\nhow people were educated,  when we decided it wasn\'t\nworth the effort  dog it. se are people whose fluence\nled to the bras beg destroyed \nhundreds  thouss  people who had\nnothg wrong with them. se are the people\nwho led to the notion that you fix up a problem that\ndoesn\'t exist by extermatg ne million people. se are not mor scientists. se are the most\nfluential people  the last century comg\nout  science  many ways livg pathologically\nside their own buckets  how they could\nexpla the entire world. And thus, aga, our goal is\ngog to not fall for that. To thk about human\nbehaviors,   some cases to thk about some\n the most disturbed, some  the most\nfrighteng, damaged human behaviors, \nresist the temptation to thk side a bucket\n fd the explanation. Aga, every level we\'re\ngog to talk about genes, hormones, neurons, environmental\nfluence, whatever it is that pot will simply\nbe the easiest way  describg all  the\nfluences that came before. y\'re not even\ntemporary buckets. re\'s no buckets. That will be our goal. Now,  thkg about\nthis  approachg human behavior, the biology\n human social behavior, ten the biology  abnormal\nhuman social behavior, we\'re gog to have three\ntellectual challenges.  first one is\nrecognizg circumstances where there is nothg\nfancy about us whatsoever. We are just like every\nother animal out there. And where the challenge\nis to accept that. Let me give you an example. You are a hamster. You are a female hamster. And you\'re sittg  your cage. And, as a female\nhamster, what you do is you ovulate every\nfive days or so. And you\'re gog\nabout your busess,  everythg\'s great. Now, somebody puts\nanother female hamster  the cage with you. And over the subsequent month or\nso, what happens is both  you will beg to\nlengthen your cycles  eventually synchronize\nthem so that you are both ovulatg the same afternoon\non a regular basis. Amazg. This actually works this way. And menstrual ovulatory\nsynchrony people underst how this\nworks  hamsters. It is done with olfaction,\nwith pheromones, with chemical airborne signals\nfrom one female to another. And you can prove this\nby electrically recordg from olfactory systems. Or, if you don\'t\nhave much fundg, you could take like a paper clip\nover the female hamster\'s nose,  she doesn\'t\nsynchronize then. It\'s all done with olfaction. And what\'s most amazg is you\nput the two females together,  there is a way\n disruptg it. Put a male hamster  there,\n suddenly the cycles desynchronize  shorten,\n you break it up with male pheromones. And what\'s even more remarkable\nis you put the two females together,  it\'s not rom\nwho synchronizes the other one.  domant female synchronizes\nthe subordate one. Totally understood. People have been workg\non this for years. And it works this way  goats,\n sheep,  dogs,  cats,  pigs. Apparently, you could go to\na 7Eleven somewhere  Iowa,  you could buy a can  pig\novulatory synchronization spray  take it home,\n just run wild. I have no idea why you\nwould want to do that. But nonetheless,\nthat\'s how you it\'s up there with the cans\n Cheese Whiz or whatever. And it\'s that well understood. And what\'s remarkable is it\nworks exactly the same way  us humans, where it is\nknown as the Wellesley Effect.  fact that over\nthe course  freshman year, this was first\nshown  Wellesley, 1970. Over the course \nfreshman year, women freshman year roommates tended\nto lengthen  synchronize their cycles. And it was done with olfaction. Women who had olfactory\ndeficits didn\'t synchronize with their roommates. y would synchronize\nunless they were havg close\ntimate relationships with a male,  which\ncase they desynchronized. And what\'s most cruel \nall is, it\'s not rom who synchronizes to who.  studies tend to show is the\ndividual who is more socially outgog, extroverted,\ndomatg, is the one who synchronizes the other one. And this is well\nenough understood that when I went\n college, people would sit around at the dner\ntable  say stuff like, Oh, when we roomed\ntogether  the summer, I had her synchronized\nby August 1st. This is what happens if you\nhang out with biologists. But we\'re exactly the same.  challenge here\nis recognizg there is nothg fancy about us. At various pots\n the class, we will look at comparisons between\nthe human  the chimp genome,  it\'s virtually the same. Some  the time, we are just a\npla old ftherack animal. Second challenge is gog to be\ncircumstances where we appear to be just like everybody\nelse, all the other organisms out there, but we\ndo somethg very different with the similarity. Let me give you an example here. You have two humans,\ntwo dividuals, who are gog through a ritual. y are sittg at a table. y\'re absolutely silent. y\'re makg no\neye contact,  they do nothg more physically\ntaxg than every now  then, one  them\npicks up their h  moves a little piece\n wood on the table. And if these happen\nto be the right two dividuals  the middle  a\nchess grmaster tournament, these people are\nmatag blood pressure for six hours runng that you\nonly see  a marathon runner. se people are gog through\nthouss  calories a day dog nothg more\nthan thkg. And this is outrageous. Because you look at\none  these chess grmasters who\'s just\ntaken down an opponent  took their\nqueen, or whatever,  they will have the\nexact same physiology as some male baboon\non the Savannah who\'s just ripped the stomach\nopen  his worst rival. And we\'re dog it\nthere just with thought. And some  the time what\'s\nremarkable about us is we have absolutely typical,\nborg physiology, but we use it  ways that\nno other animal could. We get stressed by the\nevitability  our mortality. We get stressed by readg\nsomethg awful that has happened to a child on\nthe other side  the planet. We get stressed by\nsomebody zoomg past us  some sports car, \nwe decide that we are now economically adequate. And you never even\nsee the person\'s face. You just see the car. We get stressed readg about\nsomethg awful happeng to a character  a novel. This is a whole realm\n thgs that we could do that nobody else does. And on the flip side, we can\nfeel compassion  empathy for a loved one. But we can also do\nthe same for someone on the other side  the\nplanet  a refugee camp. We can feel compassion for\na member  another species. We feel badly when\nour pets are jured. This is another realm where the\nphysiology  the response the empathy, the emotional\nbondg, all  that it\'s the same borg physiology\nas every other animal out there,  we are\nusg it  a way that is unrecognizable. Now, some  the\ntime the challenge is the third category, which\nis when we are dog somethg that no other\nanimal out there has anythg remotely similar to. Let me give you an example\nhere, a shockg example. You have a couple. y live together. y come back at the\nend  the day from work. y talk. y eat dner. y talk some more. y go to bed,\n they have sex. y talk some more. y fall asleep.  next day, they do\nthe same exact thg. y come home from work. y talk. y eat. y talk. y go to bed. y have sex. y talk some more. y do this every sgle\nnight for 30 days runng. Hippos would be\nrepulsed by this. Because hardly anybody out\nthere  the animal kgdom has nonreproductive sex,\nlet alone day after day. And nobody else out there\ntalks about it afterward. And what we\'ve got here\nis a whole novel doma  human behavior language\nuse, aspects  our sexuality, this proundly damagg\nhuman uniqueness  some dividuals confusg\naspects  sexuality with aggression. In some cases, we are gog\nto be out there on our own tryg to underst what\'s up. OK. So that will be the general\nstrategy for the course. We will resist\ncategorical thkg over,  over,  over. Not just because that\'s cool,\n nuanced,  subtle, all  that. But fall to\ncategorical thkg,  you can do unspeakable\ndamage  a realm  science that makes the difference. We will do so thkg\nconstantly about ourselves as a borg species just like\nall the others out there. As a species that has the\nsame borg physiology, but uses it  ways\nthat are unrecognizable. As a species that does\nsome thgs that are simply without precedent out there. And constantly strugglg\nwith what does biology have to do with it? General structure  the\ncourse the first half  the course is gog\nto be an overview, an troduction to\nthe various buckets, the various categories. And what we\'re\ngog to go through is understg an troduction\nto evolutionary theory, an troduction to what\nmolecular genetics has to do with behavior,\nbehavioral genetics, ethology, the bra, endocrology,\neach  these buckets. And you know what\nhappens next, which is  the second\nhalf  the course. We will look at specific\nbehaviors,   each case rip apart the buckets. And  each case,\ndo the strategy  what does the\nbehavior look like? What happened a second before?  world  neurons. What happened with the\nsensory stimuli that trigger those neurons, et cetera? l the way back to the\nevolutionary selective pressures. So the first half\n the course is gog to be the\ntroduction to the buckets. And I will tell you\nright f the bat it is a total pa  the rear. Because what we\'re\ngog to be dog is like every 2.5 lectures\njust when you were gettg the vocabulary\ndown we\'re gog to jump to a completely\ndifferent bucket. It is gog to be dizzyg, \nunpleasant,  all  that. And then second\nhalf  the course, oh, the rewards fally come\n then puttg all the pieces together, lookg at dividual\ncategories  behavior sexual behavior, aggressive\nbehavior, parental behavior, schizophrenia, depression,\npersonality disorders, language use. In each  these cases, what\'s\ngog on a second before? What\'s gog on 10\nmillion years before? Where do all these buckets\ndisappear  the teractions? So that\'s gog to be the\nstrategy for the course. Somethg critical about\nhow the course was designed is it\'s got no prerequisites. Because I really thk this is a\nsubject that everybody on Earth should be forced to learn\nabout it at gunpot. And thus, it\'s a\ngood thg, I thk, to have this not be one \nthose upper level bio classes. Let me just get a\nsense  who\'s here. How many  you are bio\ntypes, bio majors, hum bio? Psychology? Anthro? Are there any English Lit\ngrad students  here? Yeah. OK. Good for you. Thank you for comg here. See what you thk\n three months. But nonetheless, the class\nhas been designed explicitly to have no background\nwhatsoever. How are we gog to do that? We\'re gog to do the usual song\n dance  weekly sections,  reviews,  all\nthat sort  thg. But  addition,\ndurg this first half  the course when we\'re jumpg\nfrom category to category, we\'re gog to have each\nweek additional sections a catchup section\nwhich is for people who have no background\n that area, gettg you through the\nbasics,  gettg you up to speed so that you\nwill be able to then know what\'s up durg the lectures. So those will be posted.  first one  these is\nlet me make sure I\'ve got this. Yes. It will be Thursday at\n7:30  the room next door. And this is gog to\nbe the troduction to evolutionary\ntheory  gettg you ready for what will be the\nevolution lectures Wednesday  Friday  this week. If you don\'t have a\nstrong background, go to these catchup sections.  TAs who will be\ngivg that are really expert  those areas, lots\n background,  this will be your chance to catchup. Look through the hout. I thk I have a\nbunch  terms there or somethg where if\nyou are not terribly familiar with those terms \nsome disciple, that\'s a sign that you should probably go\nfor some  the catchup stuff. If you really are\njust dog this, sort  beg very adventurous\nwith no background, if you can take it pass/fail,\nthat will take f a lot  the pressure as well. Because you could then actually\npay attention to stuff here. And the whole\npot here is to be able to do this even if\nyou don\'t have a science background. Because the obvious\nargument I would make is everybody has to\nlearn behavioral biology because we\'re beg behavioral\nbiologists every time we serve on a jury. Every time we vote\nwhether or not money should be spent\non solvg some problem, whether it\'s a problem, \nwhether it\'s solvable or not. Every time we try to\nmake sense  a family member sunk  depression. Are they havg a\nbiochemical disorder, or are they just\ndulgg themselves? We\'re behavioral\nbiologists all the time. So it\'s probably a good thg\nthat we be formed ones. So the catchup sections\nthere take advantage  them. What else? We will have weekly\nsections, the usual type. People are not\nassigned to sections. re\'s gog to be 18  them\nor so a week at various times. Go to whichever works for you. re will be a midterm \nthe middle, the midterm comg as we fish the last \nthose categories, last  those buckets. re will be a fal. re\'s no paper or\nanythg like that. So that will be the pattern. What else? Other stuff here. Office hours my fice\nhours are up on the hout. Other thgs breaks. We will, with any\nluck, be able to be able to be organized enough\nso that durg each stretch  class, there will be a five\nmute break  the middle so you can st\nup,  just get to the front  the\nle for the bathroom,  then we will resume promptly\nbefore you get  there. So just to let you\nclear your heads a bit. Assignments, books, readg. re are two books that I\nhave assigned for the course. One is by me. And you don\'t even\nhave to read it. Just go buy a bunch  copies\n  brg me the receipt,  you\'ve got a\ngreat grade  there. OK, so that\'s what\nis gog to be pertent to the second\nhalf  the course. We\'re gog to give you a\nlist  the chapters that make the most sense to read.  other book is a\nbook by an author named James Gleick called Chaos. Chaos, year, after year,\nafter year,  this class provokes the strongest opions. A quarter  the\npeople decide it is the most irritatg,\nirrelevant thg that could possibly have been\nassigned  the class  hate it. About half the\npeople never quite figure out what\'s up with it. And a quarter  the people,\ntheir life is transformed. y no longer have to meditate. y no longer have to\nhave a they are at peace. At peace, I tell you. Because what this\nbook does is troduce this whole radically different\nway  thkg about biology, takg apart a world\n reductionism. For 500 years, we all have\nbeen usg a very simple model for thkg about\nlivg systems. Which is, if you want\nto underst somethg that\'s complicated, you break\nit apart to its little pieces. And once you underst\nthe little pieces  put it back\ntogether, you will underst the complex thg. And what Chaos as an\nentire field is about  this was pretty\nmuch the first book that was meant for the lay public\nabout it what Chaos shows is that\'s how you fix clocks. That\'s not how\nyou fix behaviors. That\'s not how you\nunderst behaviors. Behavior is not like a clock. Behavior is like a cloud. And you don\'t\nunderst rafall by breakg a cloud down\nto its component pieces  glug them back together. So read through that book. A lot  it is from physical\nsciences rather than biological, so we\'ll\njust be suggestg the chapters you should read. I will tell you it\nis the first book sce Baby Beluga where\nI\'ve gotten to the last page  immediately started readg\nit over aga from the front. Because along with\nBaby Beluga, it\'s had the greatest\nfluence on my life. I found this to be the most\nfluential book  my thkg about science sce college. So that is a sign. re will also be\na bunch  lectures  the second half  the course\ncoverg these fields  chaos  complexity. And if you really\nthk about it, it is gog to force a\nchange  everythg else that you brg to thkg\nabout this subject. In addition, at this moment\nthere is not a reader. Because I\'m tryg to\navoid havg to get you guys to have\nto buy a reader. I\'m tryg to redo all\nthe assigned readgs so that will just be from papers\nthat are available onle, that you\'ll be able to download. I\'m about halfway through\ngettg them there. With any luck, there will\nnot have to be a reader. But if it does exist,\nit\'s not gog to be big. It won\'t be terribly expensive. But there will be a bunch \nreadgs onle to download,  it will vary. In some cases, it will be\nreadg the whole paper. In some cases, I\'ll\nbe suggestg you just read the abstract. In some cases, it will be to\nunderst what\'s happeng  the paper  detail. In some cases,\nthis is an example  how people  this bucket\nthk about this problem. Just read the abstract. So all  that will be\nassigned  made clear. What other stuff? re\'s gog to be a huge\namount  formation onle.  coursework is gog to\nbe set up for the class. re will be copies\n the houts. re will be lecture notes. Lecture notes that I have that\nwill be about five to 10 pages coverg each lecture,\nwhich we\'ll get to about the middle  the course. And I suspect I will run\nout  steam by then. So they won\'t occur\nfor the second half. re will be commonly\nasked questions. re will be a Q&A. re\nwill be course logistics. Some  the slides will\nbe put up  there. Make use  that. re will be announcements\nabout time changg for fice hours,  thgs like that. Make sure you make use  that. And people who are\nnot formally enrolled, we are figurg\nout a way for you to get access to it as well. We\'ve also made the decision\nthat after this lecture, the houts will\nnot be on paper. And that is because\nroughly for each lecture, we will go through about\n5000 pieces  paper, even double sided. l  this stuff will get\nposted on Coursework the day before. And if that\'s gog\nto make it impossible for you to follow what happens\n class because you are the last human on \nwho was not livg f  a computer screen,\ncome  talk to me. And we will slip you an actual\npaper copy  the houts. Most  them, with\nany luck, we can avoid usg paper just because\n how many people there are  here. Let\'s see. Other stuff. Sections will start\nthis Thursday.  regular sections all\n those will be posted, the times for that. Office hours won\'t\nstart until next week.  midterm will\nbe  an eveng rather than durg a class time. And if we are on schedule,\nthe class time that day will be used for review. And anythg else? Oh, a very good suggestion\njust now given that the class before\nhere is humongous,  thus we have the\nimpossible problem  a lot  people\ntryg to get out  that while a lot  people\nare tryg to get to that. It might work best for everybody\nto come  from the top so that you flow down\nthe stairs seamlessly  drive out those other people\nbefore us out the door there. That might work a\nwhole lot better. Fal thg is we have\na team  TAs here. And they are great. Here they are. TAs, st up \nbe embarrassed. OK, st up, guys. re they are. re is all but one \nthem, who is  transit. re you are. se guys are great. y have either taken\nthe course before. In some cases they have\nTA\'d the course before. y are grad\nstudents  various  the bucket specialties. I would strongly suggest takg\nadvantage  the sections. What will evolve after\nthe first few weeks is there will be the regular\nsections gog over the course material  the usual way. re are also beg more\nadvanced sections for people who have stronger backgrounds. Take advantage. OK, you guys can sit down. Leavg them stg there\nawkwardly for hours afterward. Take advantage  the sections. Really greatly skilled TAs. OK so that\'s basically\nwhat we got gog here. Are there any questions? [INAUDIBLE] Units. OK, somebody\nemailed about units.  class is five\nunits,  it\'s because we are meetg\nfor so many hours a week. Actually, for a while the\nclass was a sixunit course. And that was because\n Condoleezza Rice. Because when she was\nthe provost here, she totally screwed\nthe biology department by uppg our\nteachg requirements under really nasty conditions. So what we all decided\nwas to fd ways, every sgle sleazy\ntrick we could do to puff up the\nnumber  units we were supposedly teachg. So for a while,\nthe five unit class here would get you six units. But eventually they caught\nus, so we stopped dog that. So first she did that,  then\nweapons  mass destruction. [LAUGHING] So it\'s a five unit\nclass at the moment. Say hi for me if you\nrun to her on campus. So five units.  workload, I thk, will\nbe commensurate with that. But it\'s maly because\n heavy class time. One additional\nthg lectures are gog to be taped  put\nup onle with a day or so on Coursework.  reason for that is given\nthat this spans two hour block, a lot  people have to\nmiss one  the hour blocks. And  the past, it has worked\nto be able to get the stuff up onle. So that will be\nadvantageous for some folks. OK. Question? Yes, there was a\nquestion up there. [INAUDIBLE] OK, you take it back. OK, any other questions? Bagel guy. Did you get your bagel,\nor did somebody eat it? [INAUDIBLE] OK, good. Good.  social contract\ncomes through. Yeah? [INAUDIBLE] What\'s that? [INAUDIBLE] Yes. I don\'t remember. [LAUGHTER] May 3rd. May 3rd for the midterm. 7:30  the eveng. It is a Monday. June th for the fal. OK, more questions? Yeah? [INAUDIBLE] What\'s the format  the\nmidterm  the fal? In an ideal world,\ngiven the whole emphasis here on no buckets,\nblah blah, et cetera, It would be long essays,\n requirements  sonnets,  sensitive haikus\nabout the hypothalamus. But simply because\n numbers  here, we are reduced to sort  like\nthe lowest common denomator, a lot  multiple\nchoice questions, just to make thgs\nsaner for the TAs. Because it is an\nunbelievable job to try to grade this\nmany papers that quickly. Broadly, tellectually,\nwhat the midterm is gog to be about\nis just touchg base, makg sure you underst\nthe basics  each  those buckets, each\n those disciples. A little bit  forcg you\nto thk across disciples. What the fal is gog\nto be entirely about is forcg you to thk\nacross the disciples, across the buckets there. So it\'s gog to be some very\ndifferent tellectual foci  there. Midterm have the facts down. Hopefully it won\'t be\nquite as mdless as that, but that\'s the ma\nfunction  the midterm. OK, more questions? [INAUDIBLE] OK. TAs, did you guys decide to\nvideotape the catchup section? [INAUDIBLE] Audio, OK. [INAUDIBLE] OK. Other fice hours, or it\'s\ngog to be taped  put up onle on Coursework. And if there\'s critical\nhouts, visuals, those will be posted\nthere as well. Good. More questions? [INAUDIBLE] Yes. And it\'s gog to be for each. It\'s gog to be  advance\n the next three lectures. [INAUDIBLE] Fal is at 7:30 for two hours. [INAUDIBLE]  fal? Oh, the fal, the fal. 5:15. [INAUDIBLE] 12:15. [LAUGHTER] Just to get that up there. 12:15. More questions? For more, please visit\nus at stord.edu."
114,0.0,"This is a map  New York State that was made  1937\nby the General Draftg Company. It\'s an extremely famous map\namong cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom\n the Catskill Mountas, there is a little town called Roscoe  actually, this will go easier\nif I just put it up here  re\'s Roscoe,  then right\nabove Roscoe is Rockl, New York,  then right above that\nis the ty town  Agloe, New York. Agloe, New York, is very famous\nto cartographers, because it\'s a paper town. It\'s also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers  because my map  New York\n your map  New York are gog to look very similar,\non account  the shape  New York  ten, mapmakers will sert\nfake places onto their maps,  order to protect their copyright. Because then, if my fake place\nshows up on your map, I can be well   sure\nthat you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization  the itials\n the two guys who made this map, Ernest pers  Otto [G.] Ldberg,  they released this map  1937. Decades later, R McNally releases a map with Agloe, New York, on it,\nat the same exact tersection  two dirt roads\n the middle  nowhere. Well, you can image the delight\nover at General Draftg. y immediately call\nR McNally,  they say, ""We\'ve caught you!\nWe made Agloe, New York, up. It is a fake place. It\'s a paper town. We\'re gog to sue your pants f!"" And R McNally says,\n""No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."" Because people kept gog\nto that tersection  two dirt roads  ()  the middle  nowhere, expectg\nthere to be a place called Agloe  someone built a place\ncalled Agloe, New York. () It had a gas station, a general store,\ntwo houses at its peak. () And this is  course a completely\nirresistible metaphor to a novelist, because we would all like to believe\nthat the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world\n which we\'re actually livg, which is why my third book\nis called ""Paper Towns"". But what terests me ultimately more\nthan the medium  which this happened, is the phenomenon itself. It\'s easy enough to say that the world\nshapes our maps  the world, right? Like the overall shape  the world\nis obviously gog to affect our maps. But what I fd a lot more\nterestg is the way that the manner  which we map\nthe world changes the world. Because the world would  be\na different place if North were down. And the world would be\na  different place if aska  Russia weren\'t\non opposite sides  the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe\nto show it  its actual size.  world is changed\nby our maps  the world.  way that we choose  sort ,\nour personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map  our lives,  that  turn shapes our lives. I believe that what we map\nchanges the life we lead. And I don\'t mean that  some, like,\nsecrety Oprah\'s Angels network, like, youcanthkyourway\noutcancer sense. But I do believe that while maps don\'t\nshow you where you will go  your life, they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place\nthat isn\'t on your personal map. So I was a really terrible student\nwhen I was a kid. My GPA was consistently  the low 2s. And I thk the reason that I was\nsuch a terrible student is that I felt like education\nwas just a series  hurdles that had been erected before me,  I had to jump over\n order to achieve adulthood. And I didn\'t really want\nto jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely\narbitrary, so I ten wouldn\'t,  then people would\nthreaten me, you know, they\'d threaten me with this\n""gog on [my] permanent record,"" or ""You\'ll never get a good job."" I didn\'t want a good job! As far as I could tell at eleven\nor twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up\nvery early  the morng, ()  the men who had good jobs,\none  the first thgs they did was tie a strangulation item\n clothg around their necks. y literally put nooses on themselves,  then they went f to their jobs,\nwhatever they were. That\'s not a recipe for a happy life. se people   my, symbolobsessed,\ntwelve yearold imagation  these people who are stranglg themselves as one  the first thgs\nthey do each morng, they can\'t possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump\nover all  these hurdles  have that be the end? That\'s a terrible end! And then, when I was  tenth grade,\nI went to this school, Indian Sprgs School,\na small boardg school, outside  Birmgham, abama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner,\nbecause I found myself  a community  learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated tellectualism\n engagement,  who thought that my ironic\nohsocool disengagement wasn\'t clever, or funny, but, like, it was a simple\n unspectacular response to very complicated\n compellg problems. And so I started to learn,\nbecause learng was cool. I learned that some fite sets\nare bigger than other fite sets,  I learned that iambic pentameter is\n why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War\nwas a nationalizg conflict, I learned some physics, I learned that correlation shouldn\'t be\nconfused with causation  all  these thgs, by the way, enriched my life\non a literally daily basis. And it\'s true that I don\'t use\nmost  them for my ""job,"" but that\'s not what it\'s about for me. It\'s about cartography. What is the process  cartography? It\'s, you know, sailg\nupon some l,  thkg, ""I thk I\'ll draw that bit  l,""  then wonderg, ""Maybe there\'s\nsome more l to draw."" And that\'s when learng\nreally began for me. It\'s true that I had teachers\nthat didn\'t give up on me,  I was very fortunate\nto have those teachers, because I ten gave them cause to thk\nthere was no reason to vest  me. But a lot  the learng\nthat I did  high school wasn\'t about what happened\nside the classroom, it was about what happened\noutside  the classroom. For stance, I can tell you that ""re\'s a certa Slant  light,\nWter Afternoons  That oppresses, like the Heft\nOf Cathedral Tunes "" not because I memorized\nEmily Dickson  school when I was  high school, but because there was a girl\nwhen I was  high school,  her name was Ama,\n I had a crush on her,  she liked Emily Dickson poetry.  reason I can tell you\nwhat opportunity cost is, is because one day when I was playg\nSuper Mario Kart on my couch, my friend Emmet walked ,  he said, ""How long have you been playg\nSuper Mario Kart?"" And I said, ""I don\'t know,\nlike, six hours?""  he said, ""Do you realize that if you\'d worked\nat BaskRobbs those six hours, you could have made 30 dollars,\nso  some ways, you just paid thirty dollars\nto play Super Mario Kart."" And I was, like, ""I\'ll take that deal."" () But I learned what opportunity cost is. And along the way, the map\n my life got better. It got bigger; it contaed more places. re were more thgs that might happen, more futures I might have. It wasn\'t a formal, organized\nlearng process,  I\'m happy to admit that. It was spotty, it was consistent,\nthere was a lot I didn\'t know. I might know, you know, Cantor\'s idea that some fite sets are larger\nthan other fite sets, but I didn\'t really underst\nthe calculus behd that idea. I might know the idea  opportunity cost, but I didn\'t know the law\n dimishg returns. But the great thg about imagg\nlearng as cartography, stead  imagg it\nas arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over, is that you see a bit  coastle,\n that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know\nat least some  the calculus that underlies all  that stuff. So, I had one learng community  high school, then I went\nto another for college,  then I went to another, when I started workg\nat a magaze called ""Booklist,"" where I was an assistant, surrounded\nby astonishgly wellread people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream  dog, I promptly quit my job. () And for the first time sce high school, I found myself without a learng\ncommunity,  it was miserable. I hated it. I read many, many books\ndurg this twoyear period. I read books about Stal,  books about how the Uzbek people\ncame to identify as Muslims,  I read books about\nhow to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like I was\ncreatg my own hurdles,  then jumpg over them myself,\nstead  feelg the excitement  beg part  a community  learners,\na community  people who are engaged together\n the cartographic enterprise  tryg to better underst\n map the world around us. And then,  2006, I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn\'t actually meet him,\njust on the Internet. Ze Frank was runng, at the time,\na show called "" Show with Ze Frank,""  I discovered the show,  that was my way back\nto beg a community learner aga. Here\'s Ze talkg about Las Vegas: (Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built\n the middle  a huge, hot desert. most everythg here was brought\nfrom somewhere else  the sort  rocks, the trees,\nthe waterfalls. se fish are almost as out  place\nas my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorchg desert\nthat surrounds this place, so are these people. Thgs from all over the world have been\nrebuilt here, away from their histories,  away from the people\nthat experience them differently. Sometimes improvements were made \neven the Sphx got a nose job. Here, there\'s no reason to feel\nlike you\'re missg anythg. This New York means the same to me\nas it does to everyone else. Everythg is out  context,  that\nmeans context allows for everythg: Self Parkg, Events Center, Shark Reef. This fabrication  place could be one\n the world\'s greatest achievements, because no one belongs here;\neveryone does. As I walked around this morng,\nI noticed most  the buildgs were huge mirrors reflectg\nthe sun back to the desert. But unlike most mirrors, which present you with an outside view\n yourself embedded  a place, these mirrors come back empty. John Green: Makes me\nnostalgic for the days when you could see\nthe pixels  onle video. () Ze isn\'t just a great public tellectual,\nhe\'s also a brilliant community builder,  the community  people\nthat built up around these videos was  many ways a community  learners. So we played Ze Frank at chess\ncollaboratively,  we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man\non a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth to a swich, by havg one person hold a piece  bread\nat one pot on the Earth,  on the exact opposite\npot  the Earth, have another person\nholdg a piece  bread. I realize that these are silly ideas,\nbut they are also ""learny"" ideas,  that was what was so excitg to me,  if you go onle, you can fd\ncommunities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,  yes, you will see people\ncomplag about calculus, but you\'ll also see people\nrebloggg those complats, makg the argument that calculus\nis terestg  beautiful,  here\'s a way  to thkg about\nthe problem that you fd unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit,\n fd subReddits, like ""Ask a Historian"" or ""Ask ,"" where you can ask people\nwho are  these fields a wide range  questions, from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me, the most terestg\ncommunities  learners that are growg up on the Internet\nright now are on YouTube,  admittedly, I am biased. But I thk  a lot  ways,\nthe YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for stance at ""Mute Physics,"" a guy who\'s teachg\nthe world about physics: (Video) Let\'s cut to the chase. As  July , 2012, the Higgs boson\nis the last fundamental piece  the stard model  particle physics\nto be discovered experimentally. But, you might ask,\nwhy was the Higgs boson cluded  the stard model, alongside wellknown particles\nlike electrons  photons  quarks, if it hadn\'t been discovered\nback then  the 1970s? Good question. re are two ma reasons. First, just like the electron\nis an excitation  the electron field, the Higgs boson is simply a particle\nwhich is an excitation  the everywherepermeatg Higgs field.  Higgs field  turn\nplays an tegral role  our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular, the Higgs field\nhelps expla why it\'s so weak. We\'ll talk more about this\n a later video, but even though weak nuclear theory was\nconfirmed  the 1980s,  the equations, the Higgs field is so extricably jumbled\nwith the weak force, that until now we\'ve been unable to confirm\nits actual  dependent existence. JG: Or here\'s a video that I made as part  my show ""Crash Course,""\ntalkg about  War I: (Video)  immediate cause was\n course the assassation  Sarajevo  the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferd, on June 28, 191, by a BosnianSerb\nnationalist named Gavrilo Prcip. Quick aside: It\'s worth notg that the first big war\n the twentieth century began with an act  terrorism. So Franz Ferd\nwasn\'t particularly wellliked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph \nnow that is a mustache! But even so, the assassation led Austria\nto issue an ultimatum to Serbia, whereupon Serbia accepted some,\nbut not all,  Austria\'s dems, leadg Austria to declare\nwar agast Serbia. And then Russia, due to its alliance\nwith the Serbs, mobilized its army. Germany, because it had\nan alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizg, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany\nmobilized its own army, declared war on Russia,\ncemented an alliance with the Ottomans,  then declared war on France,\nbecause, you know, France. () And it\'s not just physics\n world history that people are choosg\nto learn through YouTube. Here\'s a video about abstract mathematics. (Video) So you\'re me,  you\'re\n math class yet aga, because they make you go every sgle day. And you\'re learng about, I don\'t know,\nthe sums  fite series. That\'s a high school topic, right? Which is odd, because it\'s a cool topic,\nbut they somehow manage to ru it anyway. So I guess that\'s why they allow\nfite series  the curriculum. So,  a quite understable need\nfor distraction, you\'re doodlg  thkg more about what\nthe plural  ""series"" should be than about the topic at h: ""serieses,""\n""seriese,"" ""seriesen,""  ""serii?"" Or is it that the sgular should be\nchanged: one ""serie,"" or ""serum,"" just like the sgular  ""sheep""\nshould be ""shoop."" But the whole concept  thgs like 1/2 + 1/ + 1/8 + 1/16  so on\napproaches one, is useful if, say, you want to draw a le  elephants, each holdg the tail  the next one: normal elephant, young elephant,\nbaby elephant, dogsized elephant, puppysized elephant, all the way\ndown to Mr. Tusks  beyond. Which is at least a ty bit awesome, because you can get an fite number\n elephants  a le,  still have it fit across\na sgle notebook page. JG: And lastly, here\'s Dest,\nfrom ""Smarter Every Day,"" talkg about the conservation\n angular momentum, , sce it\'s YouTube, cats: (Video) Hey, it\'s me, Dest.\nWelcome back to ""Smarter Every Day."" So you\'ve probably observed that cats\nalmost always l on their feet. Today\'s question is: why? Like most simple questions,\nthere\'s a very complex answer. For stance, let me reword this question: How does a cat go from feetup\nto feetdown  a fallg reference frame, without violatg the conservation\n angular momentum? () JG: So, here\'s somethg all four\n these videos have  common: y all have more than half\na million views on YouTube. And those are people watchg\nnot  classrooms, but because they are part\n the communities  learng that are beg set up by these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube\nis like a classroom to me,   many ways it is,\nbecause here is the structor  it\'s like the oldfashioned classroom:\nhere\'s the structor,  then beneath the structor\nare the students,  they\'re all havg a conversation. And I know that YouTube comments\nhave a very bad reputation  the world  the Internet, but  fact, if you go on comments\nfor these channels, what you\'ll fd is people engagg\nthe subject matter, askg difficult, complicated questions\nthat are about the subject matter,  then other people\nanswerg those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so\nthat the page  which I\'m talkg to you is on the exact  the place where I\'m\ntalkg to you is on the exact same page as your comments, you are participatg  a live  real\n active way  the conversation. And because I\'m  comments usually,\nI get to participate with you. And you fd this\nwhether it\'s world history, or mathematics, or science,\nor whatever it is. You also see young people usg the tools\n the sort  genres  the Internet  order to create places\nfor tellectual engagement, stead  the ironic detachment that maybe most  us associate with memes\n other Internet conventions  you know, ""Got bored. Invented calculus."" Or, here\'s Honey Boo Boo\ncriticizg dustrial capitalism: [""Liberal capitalism is not at all\nthe Good  humanity. Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle\n savage, destructive nihilism.""] In case you can\'t see\nwhat she says ... yeah. I really believe that these spaces, these communities, have become\nfor a new generation  learners, the kd  communities,\nthe kd  cartographic communities that I had when I was  high school,\n then aga when I was  college. And as an adult, refdg\nthese communities has retroduced me\nto a community  learners,  has encouraged me to contue\nto be a learner even  my adulthood, so that I no longer feel like learng\nis somethg reserved for the young. Vi Hart  ""Mute Physics"" troduced me to all kds  thgs\nthat I didn\'t know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days  the Parisian salon\n the Enlightenment, or to the gonqu Round Table,  wish, ""Oh, I wish I could have been\na part  that, I wish I could have laughed\nat Dorothy Parker\'s jokes."" But I\'m here to tell you that these places\nexist, they still exist. y exist  corners  the Internet,\nwhere old men fear to tread. () And I ,  believe that when\nwe vented Agloe, New York,  the 1960s, when we made Agloe real,\nwe were just gettg started. Thank you. ()"
115,0.0,"Translator: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Morton Bast Thank you very much. I moved to America 12 years ago\nwith my wife Terry  our two kids. Actually, truthfully, we moved\nto Los Angeles  () thkg we were movg\nto America, but anyway  () It\'s a short plane ride\nfrom Los Angeles to America. () I got here 12 years ago,  when I got here,\nI was told various thgs, like, ""Americans don\'t get irony."" () Have you come across this idea? It\'s not true. I\'ve traveled the whole length\n breadth  this country. I have found no evidence\nthat Americans don\'t get irony. It\'s one  those cultural myths, like, "" British are reserved."" () I don\'t know why people thk this. We\'ve vaded every country\nwe\'ve encountered. () But it\'s not true Americans\ndon\'t get irony, but I just want you to know\nthat that\'s what people are sayg about you behd your back. You know, so when you leave\nlivg rooms  Europe, people say, thankfully,\nnobody was ironic  your presence. () But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation,\n""No Child Left Behd."" () Because whoever thought\n that title gets irony. () Don\'t they? () Because it\'s leavg\nmillions  children behd. Now I can see that\'s not a very attractive\nname for legislation: ""Millions  Children Left Behd."" I can see that. What\'s the plan? We propose to leave\nmillions  children behd,  here\'s how it\'s gog to work. And it\'s workg beautifully. () In some parts  the country, 60 percent  kids drop out\n high school. In the ive American communities, it\'s 80 percent  kids. If we halved that number, one estimate is it would create\na net ga to the U.S. economy over 10 years,\n nearly a trillion dollars. From an economic pot  view, this is good math, isn\'t it,\nthat we should do this? It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage\nfrom the dropout crisis. But the dropout crisis\nis just the tip  an iceberg. What it doesn\'t count\nare all the kids who are  school but beg disengaged\nfrom it, who don\'t enjoy it, who don\'t get any real benefit from it. And the reason is not\nthat we\'re not spendg enough money. America spends more money on education\nthan most other countries. Class sizes are smaller\nthan  many countries. And there are hundreds\n itiatives every year to try  improve education.  trouble is, it\'s all gog\n the wrong direction. re are three prciples\non which human life flourishes,  they are contradicted\nby the culture  education under which most teachers have to labor  most students have to endure.  first is this, that human begs\nare naturally different  diverse. Can I ask you, how many  you\nhave got children  your own? Okay. Or grchildren. How about two children or more? Right. And the rest  you\nhave seen such children. () Small people werg about. () I will make you a bet,  I am confident\nthat I will w the bet. If you\'ve got two children or more, I bet you they are completely\ndifferent from each other. Aren\'t they? () You would never confuse them, would you? Like, ""Which one are you? Remd me."" () ""Your mother  I need\nsome colorcodg system so we don\'t get confused."" Education under ""No Child Left Behd"" is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged\nto do is to fd out what kids can do across\na very narrow spectrum  achievement. One  the effects\n ""No Child Left Behd"" has been to narrow the focus\nonto the socalled STEM disciples. y\'re very important. I\'m not here to argue\nagast science  math. On the contrary, they\'re necessary\nbut they\'re not sufficient. A real education has to give equal weight to the arts, the humanities,\nto physical education. An awful lot  kids, sorry, thank you  () One estimate  America currently\nis that somethg like 10 percent  kids, gettg on that way, are beg diagnosed\nwith various conditions under the broad title\n attention deficit disorder. ADHD. I\'m not sayg there\'s no such thg. I just don\'t believe\nit\'s an epidemic like this. If you sit kids down, hour after hour, dog lowgrade clerical work, don\'t be surprised if they start\nto fidget, you know? () () Children are not, for the most part,\nsufferg from a psychological condition. y\'re sufferg from childhood. () And I know this because\nI spent my early life as a child. I went through the whole thg. Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum\nthat celebrates their various talents, not just a small range  them. And by the way, the arts\naren\'t just important because they improve math scores. y\'re important because they speak\nto parts  children\'s beg which are otherwise untouched.  second, thank you  ()  second prciple\nthat drives human life flourishg is curiosity. If you can light the spark\n curiosity  a child, they will learn without any further\nassistance, very ten. Children are natural learners. It\'s a real achievement\nto put that particular ability out, or to stifle it. Curiosity is the enge  achievement. Now the reason I say this is because one  the effects\n the current culture here, if I can say so, has been to depressionalize teachers. re is no system  the world\nor any school  the country that is better than its teachers. Teachers are the lifeblood\n the success  schools. But teachg is a creative pression. Teachg, properly conceived,\nis not a delivery system. You know, you\'re not there just\nto pass on received formation. Great teachers do that, but what great teachers also do is mentor, stimulate, provoke, engage. You see,  the end,\neducation is about learng. If there\'s no learng gog on,\nthere\'s no education gog on. And people can spend an awful lot  time discussg education\nwithout ever discussg learng.  whole pot  education\nis to get people to learn. An old friend  me \nactually very old, he\'s dead. () That\'s as old as it gets, I\'m afraid. () But a wonderful guy he was,\nwonderful philosopher. He used to talk about the difference between the task\n achievement senses  verbs. You can be engaged\n the activity  somethg, but not really be\nachievg it, like dietg. () It\'s a very good example. re he is. He\'s dietg. Is he losg any weight? Not really. () Teachg is a word like that. You can say, ""re\'s Deborah,\nshe\'s  room 3, she\'s teachg."" But if nobody\'s learng anythg, she may be engaged  the task  teachg\nbut not actually fulfillg it.  role  a teacher\nis to facilitate learng. That\'s it. And part  the problem is, I thk, that the domant culture\n education has come to focus on not teachg  learng, but testg. Now, testg is important. Stardized tests have a place. But they should not be\nthe domant culture  education. y should be diagnostic.\ny should help. () If I go for a medical examation,\nI want some stardized tests. I do. I want to know\nwhat my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else\'s\non a stard scale. I don\'t want to be told on some scale\nmy doctor vented  the car. () ""Your cholesterol\nis what I call Level Orange."" ""Really?"" () ""Is that good?"" ""We don\'t know."" () But all that should support learng. It shouldn\'t obstruct it,\nwhich  course it ten does. So  place  curiosity,\nwhat we have is a culture  compliance. Our children  teachers are encouraged\nto follow route algorithms rather than to excite that power\n imagation  curiosity. And the third prciple is this:\nthat human life is herently creative. It\'s why we all have different résumés. We create our lives,  we can recreate them\nas we go through them. It\'s the common currency\n beg a human beg. It\'s why human culture\nis so terestg  diverse  dynamic. I mean, other animals may well have\nimagations  creativity, but it\'s not so much\n evidence, is it, as ours? I mean, you may have a dog. And your dog may get depressed. You know, but it doesn\'t listen\nto Radiohead, does it? () And sit starg out the wdow\nwith a bottle  Jack Daniels. () ""Would you like to come for a walk?"" ""No, I\'m fe."" () ""You go. I\'ll wait. But take pictures."" () We all create our own lives\nthrough this restless process  imagg alternatives\n possibilities,  one  the roles  education is to awaken  develop\nthese powers  creativity. Instead, what we have\nis a culture  stardization. Now, it doesn\'t have to be that way. It really doesn\'t. Fl regularly comes out on top\n math, science  readg. Now, we only know\nthat\'s what they do well at, because that\'s all that\'s beg tested. That\'s one  the problems  the test. y don\'t look for other thgs\nthat matter just as much.  thg about work  Fl is this: they don\'t obsess about those disciples. y have a very broad\napproach to education, which cludes humanities,\nphysical education, the arts. Second, there is no stardized\ntestg  Fl. I mean, there\'s a bit, but it\'s not what gets\npeople up  the morng, what keeps them at their desks.  third thg \n I was at a meetg recently with some people from Fl,\nactual Fnish people,  somebody from the American system\nwas sayg to the people  Fl, ""What do you do\nabout the dropout rate  Fl?"" And they all looked a bit\nbemused,  said, ""Well, we don\'t have one. Why would you drop out? If people are  trouble,\nwe get to them quite quickly  we help  support them."" Now people always say, ""Well, you know, you can\'t compare\nFl to America."" No. I thk there\'s a population\n around five million  Fl. But you can compare it\nto a state  America. Many states  America\nhave fewer people  them than that. I mean, I\'ve been\nto some states  America  I was the only person there. () Really. Really. I was asked to lock up when I left. () But what all the highperformg\nsystems  the world do is currently what is not evident, sadly, across the systems  America  I mean, as a whole. One is this: they dividualize teachg  learng. y recognize that it\'s students\nwho are learng  the system has to engage them, their curiosity, their dividuality,\n their creativity. That\'s how you get them to learn.  second is that they attribute\na very high status to the teachg pression. y recognize\nthat you can\'t improve education if you don\'t pick great people to teach\n keep givg them constant support\n pressional development. Investg  pressional\ndevelopment is not a cost. It\'s an vestment,  every other country\nthat\'s succeedg well knows that, whether it\'s Australia, Canada, South Korea, Sgapore,\nHong Kong or Shanghai. y know that to be the case. And the third is, they devolve responsibility\nto the school level for gettg the job done. You see, there\'s a big difference here between gog to a mode  comm\n control  education  That\'s what happens  some systems. Central or state governments decide, they know best  they\'re gog\nto tell you what to do.  trouble is that education\ndoesn\'t go on  the committee rooms\n our legislative buildgs. It happens  classrooms  schools,  the people who do it\nare the teachers  the students,  if you remove their discretion,\nit stops workg. You have to put it back to the people. () re is wonderful work\nhappeng  this country. But I have to say it\'s happeng  spite  the domant\nculture  education, not because  it. It\'s like people are sailg\nto a headwd all the time. And the reason I thk is this: that many  the current policies are based on mechanistic\nconceptions  education. It\'s like education\nis an dustrial process that can be improved\njust by havg better data,  somewhere  the back  the md\n some policy makers is this idea that if we fetune it\nwell enough, if we just get it right, it will all hum along perfectly\nto the future. It won\'t,  it never did.  pot is that education\nis not a mechanical system. It\'s a human system. It\'s about people, people who either do want\nto learn or don\'t want to learn. Every student who drops\nout  school has a reason for it which is rooted  their own biography. y may fd it borg. y may fd it irrelevant. y may fd that it\'s at odds with\nthe life they\'re livg outside  school. re are trends,\nbut the stories are always unique. I was at a meetg recently\n Los Angeles   they\'re called alternative\neducation programs. se are programs designed\nto get kids back to education. y have certa common features. y\'re very personalized. y have strong support for the teachers, close lks with the community\n a broad  diverse curriculum,  ten programs which volve students\noutside school as well as side school. And they work. What\'s terestg to me is,\nthese are called ""alternative education."" () You know? And all the evidence\nfrom around the world is, if we all did that, there\'d be\nno need for the alternative. () ( ends) So I thk we have to embrace\na different metaphor. We have to recognize\nthat it\'s a human system,  there are conditions\nunder which people thrive,  conditions under which they don\'t. We are after all organic creatures,  the culture  the school\nis absolutely essential. Culture is an organic term, isn\'t it? Not far from where I live\nis a place called Death Valley. Death Valley is the hottest,\ndriest place  America,  nothg grows there. Nothg grows there\nbecause it doesn\'t ra. Hence, Death Valley. In the wter  200,\nit raed  Death Valley. Seven ches  ra fell\nover a very short period. And  the sprg  2005,\nthere was a phenomenon.  whole floor  Death Valley\nwas carpeted  flowers for a while. What it proved is this: that Death Valley isn\'t dead. It\'s dormant. Right beneath the surface\nare these seeds  possibility waitg for the right conditions\nto come about,  with organic systems,\nif the conditions are right, life is evitable. It happens all the time. You take an area, a school, a district, you change the conditions, give people\na different sense  possibility, a different set  expectations,\na broader range  opportunities, you cherish  value the relationships\nbetween teachers  learners, you fer people\nthe discretion to be creative  to novate  what they do,  schools that were once\nbereft sprg to life. Great leaders know that.  real role  leadership\n education   I thk it\'s true\nat the national level, the state level, at the school level  is not  should not be\ncomm  control.  real role  leadership\nis climate control, creatg a climate  possibility. And if you do that, people will rise to it  achieve thgs\nthat you completely did not anticipate  couldn\'t have expected. re\'s a wonderful quote\nfrom Benjam Frankl. ""re are three sorts\n people  the world: Those who are immovable, people who don\'t get it, or don\'t want to do anythg about it; there are people who are movable, people who see the need for change  are prepared to listen to it;  there are people who move, people who make thgs happen."" And if we can encourage more people,\nthat will be a movement. And if the movement is strong enough, that\'s,  the best sense\n the word, a revolution. And that\'s what we need. Thank you very much. () Thank you very much. ()"
116,0.0,"I am a capitalist,  after a 30year career  capitalism spanng three dozen companies, generatg tens  billions\n dollars  market value, I\'m not just  the top one percent,\nI\'m  the top .01 percent  all earners. Today, I have come\nto share the secrets  our success, because rich capitalists like me\nhave never been richer. So the question is, how do we do it? How do we manage to grab an evercreasg share\n the economic pie every year? Is it that rich people are smarter\nthan we were 30 years ago? Is it that we\'re workg harder\nthan we once did? Are we taller, better lookg? Sadly, no. It all comes down to just one thg: economics. Because, here\'s the dirty secret. re was a time\n which the economics pression worked  the public terest, but  the neoliberal era, today, they work only for big corporations  billionaires,  that is creatg\na little bit  a problem. We could choose to enact economic policies that raise taxes on the rich, regulate powerful corporations\nor raise wages for workers. We have done it before. But neoliberal economists would warn that all  these policies\nwould be a terrible mistake, because raisg taxes\nalways kills economic growth,  any form  government regulation is efficient,  raisg wages always kills jobs. Well, as a consequence  that thkg, over the last 30 years,  the USA alone, the top one percent has grown\n21 trillion dollars richer while the bottom 50 percent\nhave grown 900 billion dollars poorer, a pattern  wideng equality\nthat has largely repeated itself across the world. And yet, as middle class families\nstruggle to get by on wages that have not budged\n about 0 years, neoliberal economists contue to warn\nthat the only reasonable response to the paful dislocations\n austerity  globalization is even more austerity  globalization. So, what is a society to do? Well, it\'s super clear to me\nwhat we need to do. We need a new economics. So, economics has been described\nas the dismal science,  for good reason,\nbecause as much as it is taught today, it isn\'t a science at all,  spite  all\n the dazzlg mathematics. In fact, a growg number\n academics  practitioners have concluded that neoliberal\neconomic theory is dangerously wrong  that today\'s growg crises\n risg equality  growg political stability are the direct result\n decades  bad economic theory. What we now know is that the economics\nthat made me so rich isn\'t just wrong, it\'s backwards, because it turns out it isn\'t capital\nthat creates economic growth, it\'s people;  it isn\'t selfterest\nthat promotes the public good, it\'s reciprocity;  it isn\'t competition\nthat produces our prosperity, it\'s cooperation. What we can now see is that an economics\nthat is neither just nor clusive can never susta the high levels\n social cooperation necessary to enable\na modern society to thrive. So where did we go wrong? Well, it turns out\nthat it\'s become pafully obvious that the fundamental assumptions\nthat undergird neoliberal economic theory are just objectively false,  so today first I want to take you\nthrough some  those mistaken assumptions  then after describe where the science\nsuggests prosperity actually comes from. So, neoliberal economic\nassumption number one is that the market is\nan efficient equilibrium system, which basically means that if one thg\n the economy, like wages, goes up, another thg  the economy,\nlike jobs, must go down. So for example,  Seattle, where I live, when  201 we passed\nour nation\'s first 15 dollar mimum wage, the neoliberals freaked out\nover their precious equilibrium. ""If you raise the price\n labor,"" they warned, ""busesses will purchase less  it. Thouss  lowwage workers\nwill lose their jobs.  restaurants will close."" Except ... they didn\'t.  unemployment rate fell dramatically.  restaurant busess  Seattle boomed. Why? Because there is no equilibrium. Because raisg wages\ndoesn\'t kill jobs, it creates them; because, for stance, when restaurant owners are suddenly\nrequired to pay restaurant workers enough so that now even they\ncan afford to eat  restaurants, it doesn\'t shrk the restaurant busess, it grows it, obviously. () Thank you.  second assumption is that the price  somethg\nis always equal to its value, which basically means\nthat if you earn 50,000 dollars a year  I earn 50 million dollars a year, that\'s because I produce\na thous times as much value as you. Now, it will not surprise you to learn that this is a very comfortg assumption if you\'re a CEO payg yourself\n50 million dollars a year but payg your workers poverty wages. But please, take it from somebody\nwho has run dozens  busesses: this is nonsense. People are not paid what they are worth. y are paid what they have\nthe power to negotiate,  wages\' fallg share  GDP is not because workers\nhave become less productive but because employers\nhave become more powerful. And  () And by pretendg that the giant imbalance\n power between capital  labor doesn\'t exist, neoliberal economic theory\nbecame essentially a protection racket for the rich.  third assumption,\n by far the most pernicious, is a behavioral model that describes human begs\nas somethg called ""homo economicus,"" which basically means\nthat we are all perfectly selfish, perfectly rational\n relentlessly selfmaximizg. But just ask yourselves, is it plausible that every sgle time\nfor your entire life, when you did somethg\nnice for somebody else, all you were dog\nwas maximizg your own utility? Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps\non a grenade to defend fellow soldiers, they\'re just promotg\ntheir narrow selfterest? If you thk that\'s nuts, contrary to any reasonable\nmoral tuition, that\'s because it is , accordg to the latest science, not true. But it is this behavioral model which is at the cold, cruel heart\n neoliberal economics,  it is as morally corrosive as it is scientifically wrong because, if we accept at face value that humans are fundamentally selfish,  then we look around the world at all  the unambiguous\nprosperity  it, then it follows logically, then it must be true by defition, that billions  dividual\nacts  selfishness magically transubstantiate\nto prosperity  the common good. If we humans are merely\nselfish maximizers, then selfishness\nis the cause  our prosperity. Under this economic logic, greed is good, wideng equality is efficient,  the only purpose  the corporation can be to enrich shareholders, because to do otherwise\nwould be to slow economic growth  harm the economy overall. And it is this gospel  selfishness which forms the ideological cornerstone\n neoliberal economics, a way  thkg\nwhich has produced economic policies which have enabled me  my rich buddies\n the top one percent to grab virtually all  the benefits\n growth over the last 0 years. But, if stead we accept the latest empirical research, real science, which correctly\ndescribes human begs as highly cooperative, reciprocal  tuitively moral creatures, then it follows logically that it must be cooperation  not selfishness that is the cause  our prosperity,  it isn\'t our selfterest but rather our herent reciprocity that is humanity\'s economic superpower. So at the heart  this new economics is a story about ourselves that grants us\npermission to be our best selves, , unlike the old economics, this is a story that is virtuous  also has the virtue  beg true. Now, I want to emphasize\nthat this new economics is not somethg I have personally\nimaged or vented. Its theories  models\nare beg developed  refed  universities around the world buildg on some  the best\nnew research  economics, complexity theory, evolutionary theory, psychology, anthropology\n other disciples. And although this new economics\ndoes not yet have its own textbook or even a commonly agreed upon name,  broad strokes its explanation  where prosperity\ncomes from goes somethg like this. So, market capitalism\nis an evolutionary system  which prosperity emerges through a positive feedback loop between creasg amounts  novation\n creasg amounts  consumer dem. Innovation is the process\nby which we solve human problems, consumer dem is the mechanism\nthrough which the market selects for useful novations,  as we solve more problems,\nwe become more prosperous. But as we become more prosperous, our problems  solutions become more complex,  this creasg technical complexity requires ever higher levels\n social  economic cooperation  order to produce\nthe more highly specialized products that defe a modern economy. Now, the old economics\nis correct,  course, that competition plays a crucial role\n how markets work, but what it fails to see is that it is largely a competition\nbetween highly cooperative groups  competition between firms,\ncompetition between networks  firms, competition between nations   anyone who has ever run\na successful busess knows that buildg a cooperative team\nby cludg the talents  everyone is almost always a better strategy\nthan just a bunch  selfish jerks. So how do we leave neoliberalism behd  build a more sustaable,\nmore prosperous  more equitable society?  new economics suggests\njust five rules  thumb. First is that successful economies\nare not jungles, they\'re gardens, which is to say that markets, like gardens, must be tended, that the market is the greatest\nsocial technology ever vented for solvg human problems, but unconstraed by social norms\nor democratic regulation, markets evitably create\nmore problems than they solve. Climate change, the great fancial crisis  2008 are two easy examples.  second rule is that clusion creates economic growth. So the neoliberal idea that clusion is this fancy luxury to be afforded if  when we have growth\nis both wrong  backwards.  economy is people. Includg more people  more ways is what causes economic growth\n market economies.  third prciple is the purpose  the corporation\nis not merely to enrich shareholders.  greatest grift\n contemporary economic life is the neoliberal idea that\nthe only purpose  the corporation  the only responsibility  executives is to enrich themselves  shareholders.  new economics must  can sist that the purpose  the corporation is to improve the welfare\n all stakeholders: customers, workers, community  shareholders alike. Rule four: greed is not good. Beg rapacious\ndoesn\'t make you a capitalist, it makes you a sociopath. () () And  an economy as dependent\nupon cooperation at scale as ours, sociopathy is as bad for busess\nas it is for society. And fifth  fally, unlike the laws  physics, the laws  economics are a choice. Now, neoliberal economic theory has sold itself to you\nas unchangeable natural law, when  fact it\'s social norms\n constructed narratives based on pseudoscience. If we  want a more equitable, more prosperous\n more sustaable economy, if we want highfunctiong democracies  civil society, we must have a new economics. And here\'s the good news: if we want a new economics, all we have to do is choose to have it. Thank you. () Moderator: So Nick,\nI\'m sure you get this question a lot. If you\'re so unhappy\nwith the economic system, why not just give all your money away\n jo the 99 percent? Nick Hanauer: Yeah, no, yes, right. You get that a lot. You get that a lot. ""If you care so much about taxes,\nwhy don\'t you pay more,  if you care so much about wages,\nwhy don\'t you pay more?"" And I could do that.  problem is, it doesn\'t make that much difference,  I have discovered a strategy that works literally\na hundred thous times better  Moderator: OK. NH: which is to use my money\nto build narratives  to pass laws that will require\nall the other rich people to pay taxes  pay their workers better. () And so, for example, the 15dollar mimum wage\nthat we cooked up has now affected 30 million workers. So that works better. Moderator: That\'s great. If you change your md,\nwe\'ll fd some takers for you. NH: OK. Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you very much."
117,0.0,"One  my earliest memories is  tryg to wake up\none  my relatives  not beg able to. And I was just a little kid,\nso I didn\'t really underst why, but as I got older, I realized we had\ndrug addiction  my family, cludg later cocae addiction. I\'d been thkg about it a lot lately,\npartly because it\'s now exactly 100 years sce drugs were first banned\n the United States  Brita,  we then imposed that\non the rest  the world. It\'s a century sce we made\nthis really fateful decision to take addicts  punish them\n make them suffer, because we believed that would deter them;\nit would give them an centive to stop. And a few years ago, I was lookg at\nsome  the addicts  my life who I love,  tryg to figure out\nif there was some way to help them. And I realized there were loads\n credibly basic questions I just didn\'t know the answer to, like, what really causes addiction? Why do we carry on with this approach\nthat doesn\'t seem to be workg,  is there a better way out there\nthat we could try stead? So I read loads  stuff about it,  I couldn\'t really fd\nthe answers I was lookg for, so I thought, okay, I\'ll go  sit\nwith different people around the world who lived this  studied this  talk to them  see\nif I could learn from them. And I didn\'t realize I would end up\ngog over 30,000 miles at the start, but I ended up gog  meetg\nloads  different people, from a transgender crack dealer\n Brownsville, Brooklyn, to a scientist who spends a lot  time\nfeedg hallucogens to mongooses to see if they like them  it turns out they do, but only\n very specific circumstances  to the only country that\'s ever\ndecrimalized all drugs, from cannabis to crack, Portugal. And the thg I realized\nthat really blew my md is, almost everythg we thk\nwe know about addiction is wrong,  if we start to absorb\nthe new evidence about addiction, I thk we\'re gog to have to change\na lot more than our drug policies. But let\'s start with what we thk\nwe know, what I thought I knew. Let\'s thk about this middle row here. Image all  you, for 20 days now, went\nf  used hero three times a day. Some  you look a little more\nenthusiastic than others at this prospect. () Don\'t worry,\nit\'s just a thought experiment. Image you did that, right? What would happen? Now, we have a story about what would\nhappen that we\'ve been told for a century. We thk, because there are\nchemical hooks  hero, as you took it for a while, your body would become\ndependent on those hooks, you\'d start to physically need them,  at the end  those 20 days,\nyou\'d all be hero addicts. Right? That\'s what I thought. First thg that alerted me to the fact\nthat somethg\'s not right with this story is when it was explaed to me. If I step out  this  Talk today\n I get hit by a car  I break my hip, I\'ll be taken to hospital\n I\'ll be given loads  diamorphe. Diamorphe is hero. It\'s actually much better hero\nthan you\'re gog to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy\nfrom a drug dealer is contamated. Actually, very little  it is hero, whereas the stuff you get\nfrom the doctor is medically pure. And you\'ll be given it for quite\na long period  time. re are loads  people  this room, you may not realize it,\nyou\'ve taken quite a lot  hero. And anyone who is watchg this\nanywhere  the world, this is happeng. And if what we believe\nabout addiction is right  those people are exposed\nto all those chemical hooks  What should happen?\ny should become addicts. This has been studied really carefully. It doesn\'t happen; you will have noticed\nif your grmother had a hip replacement, she didn\'t come out as a junkie.\n() And when I learned this,\nit seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everythg I\'d been told,\neverythg I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn\'t be right,\nuntil I met a man called Bruce exer. He\'s a pressor\n psychology  Vancouver who carried out an credible experiment I thk really helps us\nto underst this issue. Pressor exer explaed to me, the idea  addiction we\'ve all\ngot  our heads, that story, comes partly from a series  experiments that were done earlier\n the 20th century. y\'re really simple. You can do them tonight at home\nif you feel a little sadistic. You get a rat  you put it  a cage,\n you give it two water bottles: One is just water,  the other is water\nlaced with either hero or cocae. If you do that, the rat will almost always\nprefer the drug water  almost always\nkill itself quite quickly. So there you go, right?\nThat\'s how we thk it works. In the \'70s, Pressor exer comes\nalong  he looks at this experiment  he noticed somethg. He said ah, we\'re puttg\nthe rat  an empty cage. It\'s got nothg to do\nexcept use these drugs. Let\'s try somethg different. So Pressor exer built a cage\nthat he called ""Rat Park,"" which is basically heaven for rats. y\'ve got loads  cheese,\nthey\'ve got loads  colored balls, they\'ve got loads  tunnels. Crucially, they\'ve got loads  friends.\ny can have loads  sex. And they\'ve got both the water bottles,\nthe normal water  the drugged water. But here\'s the fascatg thg: In Rat Park, they don\'t\nlike the drug water. y almost never use it. None  them ever use it compulsively. None  them ever overdose. You go from almost 100 percent overdose\nwhen they\'re isolated to zero percent overdose when they\nhave happy  connected lives. Now, when he first saw this,\nPressor exer thought, maybe this is just a thg about rats,\nthey\'re quite different to us. Maybe not as different as we\'d like,\nbut, you know  But fortunately, there was\na human experiment to the exact same prciple happeng\nat the exact same time. It was called the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, 20 percent  all American\ntroops were usg loads  hero,  if you look at the news\nreports from the time, they were really worried, because\nthey thought, my God, we\'re gog to have hundreds  thouss  junkies\non the streets  the United States when the war ends; it made total sense. Now, those soldiers who were usg\nloads  hero were followed home.  Archives  General Psychiatry\ndid a really detailed study,  what happened to them? It turns out they didn\'t go to rehab.\ny didn\'t go to withdrawal. Netyfive percent  them just stopped. Now, if you believe the story\nabout chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense,\nbut Pressor exer began to thk there might be a different\nstory about addiction. He said, what if addiction isn\'t\nabout your chemical hooks? What if addiction is about your cage? What if addiction is an adaptation\nto your environment? Lookg at this, there was another pressor\ncalled Peter Cohen  the Netherls who said, maybe we shouldn\'t\neven call it addiction. Maybe we should call it bondg. Human begs have a natural\n nate need to bond,  when we\'re happy  healthy,\nwe\'ll bond  connect with each other, but if you can\'t do that, because you\'re traumatized or isolated\nor beaten down by life, you will bond with somethg\nthat will give you some sense  relief. Now, that might be gamblg,\nthat might be pornography, that might be cocae,\nthat might be cannabis, but you will bond  connect\nwith somethg because that\'s our nature. That\'s what we want as human begs. And at first, I found this quite\na difficult thg to get my head around, but one way that helped me\nto thk about it is, I can see, I\'ve got over by my seat\na bottle  water, right? I\'m lookg at lots  you,  lots\n you have bottles  water with you. Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war. Totally legally, all  those bottles\n water could be bottles  vodka, right? We could all be gettg drunk \nI might after this  ()  but we\'re not. Now, because you\'ve been able to afford\nthe approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get to a  Talk,\nI\'m guessg you guys could afford to be drkg vodka\nfor the next six months. You wouldn\'t end up homeless. You\'re not gog to do that,\n the reason you\'re not gog to do that is not because anyone\'s stoppg you. It\'s because you\'ve got\nbonds  connections that you want to be present for. You\'ve got work you love.\nYou\'ve got people you love. You\'ve got healthy relationships. And a core part  addiction, I came to thk,  I believe\nthe evidence suggests, is about not beg able to bear\nto be present  your life. Now, this has really\nsignificant implications.  most obvious implications\nare for the War on Drugs. In Arizona, I went out\nwith a group  women who were made to wear tshirts\nsayg, ""I was a drug addict,""  go out on cha gangs  dig graves\nwhile members  the public jeer at them,  when those women get out  prison,\nthey\'re gog to have crimal records that mean they\'ll never work\n the legal economy aga. Now, that\'s a very extreme example,\nobviously,  the case  the cha gang, but actually almost\neverywhere  the world we treat addicts to some degree like that. We punish them. We shame them.\nWe give them crimal records. We put barriers between them reconnectg. re was a doctor  Canada,\nDr. Gabor Maté, an amazg man, who said to me, if you wanted to design\na system that would make addiction worse, you would design that system. Now, there\'s a place that decided\nto do the exact opposite,  I went there to see how it worked. In the year 2000, Portugal had\none  the worst drug problems  Europe. One percent  the population was addicted\nto hero, which is kd  mdblowg,  every year, they tried\nthe American way more  more. y punished people  stigmatized them\n shamed them more,  every year, the problem got worse. And one day, the Prime Mister \nthe leader  the opposition got together,  basically said, look, we can\'t go on with a country where we\'re havg\never more people becomg hero addicts. Let\'s set up a panel\n scientists  doctors to figure out what would\ngenuely solve the problem. And they set up a panel led by\nan amazg man called Dr. João Goulão, to look at all this new evidence,  they came back  they said, ""Decrimalize all drugs\nfrom cannabis to crack, but""   this is the crucial next step  ""take all the money we used to spend\non cuttg addicts f, on disconnectg them,  spend it stead\non reconnectg them with society."" And that\'s not really what we thk \nas drug treatment  the United States  Brita. So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy,\nthat does have some value. But the biggest thg they did\nwas the complete opposite  what we do: a massive program\n job creation for addicts,  microloans for addicts\nto set up small busesses. So say you used to be a mechanic. When you\'re ready, they\'ll go\nto a garage,  they\'ll say, if you employ this guy for a year,\nwe\'ll pay half his wages.  goal was to make sure\nthat every addict  Portugal had somethg to get out\n bed for  the morng. And when I went  met the addicts\n Portugal, what they said is,\nas they rediscovered purpose, they rediscovered bonds\n relationships with the wider society. It\'ll be 15 years this year\nsce that experiment began,  the results are : jectg drug use is down  Portugal, accordg to the British\n  Crimology, by 50 percent, fivezero percent. Overdose is massively down,\nHIV is massively down among addicts. Addiction  every study\nis significantly down. One  the ways you know it\'s worked\nso well is that almost nobody  Portugal wants to go back to the old system. Now, that\'s the political implications. I actually thk there\'s a layer\n implications to all this research below that. We live  a culture where people\nfeel really creasgly vulnerable to all sorts  addictions,\nwhether it\'s to their smartphones or to shoppg or to eatg. Before these talks began \nyou guys know this  we were told we weren\'t allowed\nto have our smartphones on,  I have to say, a lot  you\nlooked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer\nwas gog to be unavailable for the next couple  hours. () A lot  us feel like that,\n it might sound weird to say, I\'ve been talkg about how disconnection\nis a major driver  addiction  weird to say it\'s growg, because you thk we\'re the most connected\nsociety that\'s ever been, surely. But I creasgly began to thk\nthat the connections we have or thk we have, are like a kd\n parody  human connection. If you have a crisis  your life,\nyou\'ll notice somethg. It won\'t be your Twitter followers\nwho come to sit with you. It won\'t be your Facebook friends\nwho help you turn it round. It\'ll be your flesh  blood friends\nwho you have deep  nuanced  textured, facetace\nrelationships with,  there\'s a study I learned about from\nBill McKibben, the environmental writer, that I thk tells us a lot about this. It looked at the number  close friends\nthe average American believes they can call on  a crisis. That number has been declg\nsteadily sce the 1950s.  amount  floor space\nan dividual has  their home has been steadily creasg,  I thk that\'s like a metaphor for the choice we\'ve made as a culture. We\'ve traded floorspace for friends,\nwe\'ve traded stuff for connections,  the result is we are one  the\nloneliest societies there has ever been. And Bruce exer, the guy who did\nthe Rat Park experiment, says, we talk all the time  addiction\nabout dividual recovery,  it\'s right to talk about that, but we need to talk much more\nabout social recovery. Somethg\'s gone wrong with us,\nnot just with dividuals but as a group,  we\'ve created a society where,\nfor a lot  us, life looks a whole lot more\nlike that isolated cage  a whole lot less like Rat Park. If I\'m honest, this isn\'t\nwhy I went to it. I didn\'t go  to the discover\nthe political stuff, the social stuff. I wanted to know how to help\nthe people I love. And when I came back from this\nlong journey  I\'d learned all this, I looked at the addicts  my life,  if you\'re really cid,\nit\'s hard lovg an addict,  there\'s gog to be lots  people\nwho know  this room. You are angry a lot  the time,  I thk one  the reasons\nwhy this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart\n each  us, right? Everyone has a bit  them\nthat looks at an addict  thks, I wish someone would just stop you. And the kd  scripts we\'re told for how\nto deal with the addicts  our lives is typified by, I thk, the reality show ""Intervention,""\nif you guys have ever seen it. I thk everythg  our lives\nis defed by reality TV, but that\'s another  Talk. If you\'ve ever seen\nthe show ""Intervention,"" it\'s a pretty simple premise. Get an addict, all the people\n their life, gather them together, confront them with what they\'re dog,\n they say, if you don\'t shape up, we\'re gog to cut you f. So what they do is they take\nthe connection to the addict,  they threaten it,\nthey make it contgent on the addict behavg the way they want. And I began to thk, I began to see\nwhy that approach doesn\'t work,  I began to thk that\'s almost like\nthe importg  the logic  the Drug War to our private lives. So I was thkg,\nhow could I be Portuguese? And what I\'ve tried to do now,\n I can\'t tell you I do it consistently  I can\'t tell you it\'s easy, is to say to the addicts  my life that I want to deepen\nthe connection with them, to say to them, I love you\nwhether you\'re usg or you\'re not. I love you, whatever state you\'re ,  if you need me,\nI\'ll come  sit with you because I love you  I don\'t\nwant you to be alone or to feel alone. And I thk the core  that message  you\'re not alone, we love you  has to be at every level\n how we respond to addicts, socially, politically  dividually. For 100 years now, we\'ve been sgg\nwar songs about addicts. I thk all along we should have been\nsgg love songs to them, because the opposite  addiction\nis not sobriety.  opposite  addiction is connection. Thank you. ()"
118,0.0,"We all make decisions every day; we want to know what the right thg is to do   domas from the fancial to the gastronomic to the pressional to the romantic. And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thg at all possible times, that would be a tremendous gift. It turns out that,  fact, the world was given this gift  1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli. And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,  I also want to expla to you why it is that it hasn\'t made a damn bit  difference. Now, this is Bernoulli\'s gift. This is a direct quote. And if it looks like Greek to you, it\'s because, well, it\'s Greek. But the simple English translation  much less precise, but it captures the gist  what Bernoulli had to say  was this:  expected value  any  our actions  that is, the goodness that we can count on gettg  is the product  two simple thgs: the odds that this action will allow us to ga somethg,  the value  that ga to us. In a sense, what Bernoulli was sayg is, if we can estimate  multiply these two thgs, we will always know precisely how we should behave. Now, this simple equation, even for those  you who don\'t like equations, is somethg that you\'re quite used to. Here\'s an example: if I were to tell you, let\'s play a little co toss game,  I\'m gog to flip a co,  if it comes up heads, I\'m gog to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege  playg with me, most  you would say, sure, I\'ll take that bet. Because you know that the odds  you wng are one half, the ga if you do is 10 dollars, that multiplies to five,  that\'s more than I\'m chargg you to play. So, the answer is, yes. This is what statisticians technically call a damn fe bet. Now, the idea is simple when we\'re applyg it to co tosses, but  fact, it\'s not very simple  everyday life. People are horrible at estimatg both  these thgs,  that\'s what I want to talk to you about today. re are two kds  errors people make when tryg to decide what the right thg is to do,  those are errors  estimatg the odds that they\'re gog to succeed,  errors  estimatg the value  their own success. Now, let me talk about the first one first. Calculatg odds would seem to be somethg rather easy: there are six sides to a die, two sides to a co, 52 cards  a deck. You all know what the likelihood is  pullg the ace  spades or  flippg a heads. But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply  everyday life. That\'s why Americans spend more  I should say, lose more  gamblg than on all other forms  entertament combed.  reason is, this isn\'t how people do odds.  way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs. Now, the question I\'m gog to put to you is whether you thk there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed  any particular day  Oxford. And  course, you all know that the answer is dogs. And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed  memory the times you\'ve seen dogs  pigs on leashes. It was very easy to remember seeg dogs, not so easy to remember pigs. And each one  you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your md, then dogs on leashes are more probable. That\'s not a bad rule  thumb, except when it is. So, for example, here\'s a word puzzle. Are there more fourletter English words with R  the third place or R  the first place? Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,  it\'s awfully easy to say to yourself, Rg, Rang, Rung,  very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly. But  fact, there are many more words  the English language with R  the third than the first place.  reason words with R  the third place come slowly to your md isn\'t because they\'re improbable, unlikely or frequent. It\'s because the md recalls words by their first letter. You kd  shout out the sound, S   the word comes. It\'s like the dictionary; it\'s hard to look thgs up by the third letter. So, this is an example  how this idea that the quickness with which thgs come to md can give you a sense  their probability  how this idea could lead you astray. It\'s not just puzzles, though. For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die  a variety  terestg ways  these are estimates  number  deaths per year per 200 million U.S. citizens. And these are just ordary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowng, etc. Compare these to the actual numbers. Now, you see a very terestg pattern here, which is first  all, two thgs are vastly overestimated, namely tornadoes  fireworks. Two thgs are vastly underestimated: dyg by drowng  dyg by asthma. Why? When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper  the headle was, ""Boy dies  Asthma?"" It\'s not terestg because it\'s so common. It\'s very easy for all  us to brg to md stances  news stories or newsreels where we\'ve seen tornadoes devastatg cities, or some poor schmuck who\'s blown his hs f with a firework on the Fourth  July. Drowngs  asthma deaths don\'t get much coverage. y don\'t come quickly to md,  as a result, we vastly underestimate them. Indeed, this is kd  like the Sesame  game  ""Which thg doesn\'t belong?"" And you\'re right to say it\'s the swimmg pool that doesn\'t belong, because the swimmg pool is the only thg on this slide that\'s actually very dangerous.  way that more  you are likely to die than the combation  all three  the others that you see on the slide.  lottery is an excellent example,  course  an excellent testcase  people\'s ability to compute probabilities. And economists  forgive me, for those  you who play the lottery  but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax, because the odds  gettg any payf by vestg your money  a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushg the money directly down the toilet  which, by the way, doesn\'t require that you actually go to the store  buy anythg. Why  the world would anybody ever play the lottery? Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is, we see a lot  wners. Right? When this couple ws the lottery, or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check  how the hell do you cash thgs that size, I don\'t know. We see this on TV; we read about it  the paper. When was the last time that you saw extensive terviews with everybody who lost? Indeed, if we required that television stations run a 30second terview with each loser every time they terview a wner, the 100 million losers  the last lottery would require neahalf years  your undivided attention just to watch them say, ""Me? I lost."" ""Me? I lost."" Now, if you watch neahalf years  television  no sleep, no potty breaks   you saw loss after loss after loss,  then at the end there\'s 30 seconds , "" I won,"" the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small. Look, I can prove this to you: here\'s a little lottery. re\'s 10 tickets  this lottery. Ne  them have been sold to these dividuals. It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket , if you w, you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet? Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.  expected value  this lottery is two dollars; this is a lottery  which you should vest your money. And most people say, ""OK, I\'ll play."" Now, a slightly different version  this lottery: image that the ne tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy. Leroy has ne tickets; there\'s one left. Do you want it? Most people won\'t play this lottery. Now, you can see the odds  wng haven\'t changed, but it\'s now fantastically easy to image who\'s gog to w. It\'s easy to see Leroy gettg the check, right? You can\'t say to yourself, ""I\'m as likely to w as anybody,"" because you\'re not as likely to w as Leroy.  fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play, even though it does nothg whatsoever to the odds. Now, estimatg odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece  cake compared to tryg to estimate value: tryg to say what somethg is worth, how much we\'ll enjoy it, how much pleasure it will give us. I want to talk now about errors  value. How much is this  Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars? Most  you have the tuition that it\'s not  you wouldn\'t pay that for it. But  fact, to decide whether a  Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one,  only one question, which is: What else can I do with 25 dollars? If you\'ve ever gotten on one  those longhaul flights to Australia  realized that they\'re not gog to serve you any food, but somebody  the row  front  you has just opened the McDonald\'s bag,  the smell  golden arches is waftg over the seat, you thk, I can\'t do anythg else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours. I can\'t even set it on fire  they took my cigarette lighter! Suddenly, 25 dollars for a  Mac might be a good deal. On the other h, if you\'re visitg an underdeveloped country,  25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it\'s exorbitant for a  Mac. Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no, before I\'d even told you anythg about the context? Because most  you compared the price  this  Mac to the price you\'re used to payg. Rather than askg, ""What else can I do with my money,"" comparg this vestment to other possible vestments, you compared to the past. And this is a systematic error people make. What you knew is, you paid three dollars  the past; 25 is outrageous. This is an error,  I can prove it to you by showg the kds  irrationalities to which it leads. For example, this is,  course, one  the most delicious tricks  marketg, is to say somethg used to be higher,  suddenly it seems like a very good deal. When people are asked about these two different jobs: a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 0K, a job where you\'re gettg a salary cut each year,  one  which you\'re gettg a salary crease, people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact they\'re all told they make much less money. Why? Because they had the sense that declg wages are worse than risg wages, even when the total amount  wages is higher  the declg period. Here\'s another nice example. Here\'s a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it\'s now on sale for 1,600. Assumg you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package? Most people say they would. Here\'s a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week. By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone  the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no. Why? Because it used to cost 700,  there\'s no way I\'m payg 1,500 for somethg that was 700 last week. This tendency to compare to the past is causg people to pass up the better deal. In other words, a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal. Here\'s another example  how comparg to the past can befuddle our decisions. Image that you\'re gog to the theater. You\'re on your way to the theater. In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars. You also have a 20dollar bill. When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you\'ve lost the ticket. Would you spend your remag money on replacg it? Most people answer, no. Now, let\'s just change one thg  this scenario. You\'re on your way to the theater,   your wallet you have two 20dollar bills. When you arrive you discover you\'ve lost one  them. Would you spend your remag 20 dollars on a ticket? Well,  course, I went to the theater to see the play. What does the loss  20 dollars along the way have to do? Now, just  case you\'re not gettg it, here\'s a schematic  what happened, OK? () ong the way, you lost somethg. In both cases, it was a piece  paper. In one case, it had a U.S. president on it;  the other case it didn\'t. What the hell difference should it make?  difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself, I\'m not payg twice for the same thg. You compare the cost  the play now  0 dollars  to the cost that it used to have  20 dollars   you say it\'s a bad deal. Comparg with the past causes many  the problems that behavioral economists  psychologists identify  people\'s attempts to assign value. But even when we compare with the possible, stead  the past, we still make certa kds  mistakes. And I\'m gog to show you one or two  them. One  the thgs we know about comparison: that when we compare one thg to the other, it changes its value. So  1992, this fellow, rge Bush, for those  us who were kd  on the liberal side  the political spectrum, didn\'t seem like such a great guy. Suddenly, we\'re almost longg for him to return. ()  comparison changes how we evaluate him. Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did,  course,  they use this wisdom to help you  spare you the undue burden  money. And so a retailer, if you were to go to a we shop  you had to buy a bottle  we,  you see them here for eight, 27  33 dollars, what would you do? Most people don\'t want the most expensive, they don\'t want the least expensive. So, they will opt for the item  the middle. If you\'re a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf, because suddenly the $33 we doesn\'t look as expensive  comparison. So I\'m tellg you somethg you already knew: namely, that comparison changes the value  thgs. Here\'s why that\'s a problem: the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle  we home, it won\'t matter what it used to be sittg on the shelf next to.  comparisons we make when we are appraisg value, where we\'re tryg to estimate how much we\'ll like thgs, are not the same comparisons we\'ll be makg when we consume them. This problem  shiftg comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions. Let me just give you an example. I have to show you somethg from my own lab, so let me sneak this . se are subjects comg to an experiment to be asked the simplest  all questions: How much will you enjoy eatg potato chips one mute from now? y\'re sittg  a room with potato chips  front  them. For some  the subjects, sittg  the far corner  a room is a box  Godiva chocolates,  for others is a can  Spam. In fact, these items that are sittg  the room change how much the subjects thk they\'re gog to enjoy the potato chips. Namely, those who are lookg at Spam thk potato chips are gog to be quite tasty; those who are lookg at Godiva chocolate thk they won\'t be nearly so tasty. Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips? Well, look, you didn\'t need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful  greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what\'s sittg  the corner  the room makes not a damn bit  difference to your gustatory experience. Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through  change their experience. You\'ve all experienced this yourself, even if you\'ve never come to our lab to eat potato chips. So here\'s a question: You want to buy a car stereo.  dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks. So would you drive to get 50 percent f, savg 100 dollars? Most people say they would. y can\'t image buyg it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half f. Now, let\'s image stead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,  the dealer near your house had it for 31,000. But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900. Would you drive to get it? At this pot, 0.003 savgs  the 100 dollars. Most people say, no, I\'m gog to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase  a car? This kd  thkg drives economists crazy,  it should. Because this 100 dollars that you save  hello!  doesn\'t know where it came from. It doesn\'t know what you saved it on. When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn\'t go, I\'m the money saved on the car stereo, or, I\'m the dumb money saved on the car. It\'s money. And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it\'s worth 100 bucks no matter what you\'re savg it on. People don\'t thk that way. That\'s why they don\'t know whether their mutual fund manager is takg 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent  their vestment, but they clip coupons to save one dollar f  toothpaste. Now, you can see, this is the problem  shiftg comparisons, because what you\'re dog is, you\'re comparg the 100 bucks to the purchase that you\'re makg, but when you go to spend that money you won\'t be makg that comparison. You\'ve all had this experience. If you\'re an American, for example, you\'ve probably traveled  France. And at some pot you may have met a couple from your own hometown,  you thought, ""Oh, my God, these people are so warm. y\'re so nice to me. I mean, compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language  hate me more when I don\'t, these people are just wonderful."" And so you tour France with them,  then you get home  you vite them over for dner,  what do you fd? Compared to your regular friends, they are borg  dull, right? Because  this new context, the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you fd yourself dislikg them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship. Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo. You go to the stereo store, you see two sets  speakers  these big, boxy, monoliths,  these little, sleek speakers,  you play them,  you go, you know, I do hear a difference: the big ones sound a little better. And so you buy them,  you brg them home,  you entirely violate the décor  your house. And the problem,  course, is that this comparison you made  the store is a comparison you\'ll never make aga. What are the odds that years later you\'ll turn on the stereo  go, ""Sounds so much better than those little ones,"" which you can\'t even remember hearg.  problem  shiftg comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. People have a lot  trouble makg decisions about thgs that will happen at different pots  time. And what psychologists  behavioral economists have discovered is that by  large people use two simple rules. So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem  then a third, hard, problem. Here\'s the first easy problem: You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer? This is what we call a oneitem IQ test, OK? l  us, I hope, prefer more money,  the reason is, we believe more is better than less. Here\'s the second problem: You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars  a month. Which would you prefer? Aga, an easy decision, because we all know that now is better than later. What\'s hard  our decisionmakg is when these two rules conflict. For example, when you\'re fered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars  a month. This typifies a lot  situations  life  which you will ga by waitg, but you have to be patient. What do we know? What do people do  these kds  situations? Well, by  large people are enormously impatient. That is, they require terest rates  the hundred or thouss  percents  order to delay gratification  wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars. Maybe that isn\'t so remarkable, but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changg when the delivery  these monetary units will happen. Image that you can have 50 dollars  a year  that\'s 12 months  or 60 dollars  13 months. What do we fd now? People are gladly willg to wait: as long as they\'re waitg 12, they might as well wait 13. What makes this dynamic consistency happen? Comparison. Troublg comparison. Let me show you. This is just a graph showg the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is, people fd that the subjective value  50 is higher than the subjective value  60 when they\'ll be delivered  now or one month, respectively  a 30day delay  but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision f to the future a year. Now, why  the world do you get this pattern  results? se guys can tell us. What you see here are two lads, one  them larger than the other: the fireman  the fiddler. y are gog to recede towards the vanishg pot  the horizon,  I want you to notice two thgs. At no pot will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No pot. However, the difference between them seems to be gettg smaller. First it\'s an ch  your view, then it\'s a quarterch, then a halfch,  then fally they go f the edge  the earth. Here are the results  what I just showed you. This is the subjective height  the height you saw  these guys at various pots. And I want you to see that two thgs are true. One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;  two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler. But watch what happens when we make some  them disappear. Right. At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman, but at a far distance their normal, their true, relations are preserved. As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value. se are the results  the hard problem I gave you: 60 now or 50  a month? And these are subjective values,  what you can see is, our two rules are preserved. People always thk more is better than less: 60 is always better than 50,  they always thk now is better than later: the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side. Watch what happens when we drop some out. Suddenly we have the dynamic consistency that puzzled us. We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waitg a month, but not if that decision is far  the future. Notice somethg terestg that this implies  namely, that when people get to the future, they will change their mds. That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say, what was I thkg, waitg an extra month for 60 dollars? I\'ll take the 50 dollars now. Well, the question with which I\'d like to end is this: If we\'re so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon? Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence  people\'s ability to estimate odds  ability to estimate value.  answer to this question, I thk, is an answer you\'ve already heard  some  the talks,  I dare say you will hear aga: namely, that our bras were evolved for a very different world than the one  which we are livg. y were evolved for a world  which people lived  very small groups, rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves, had rather short lives  which there were few choices  the highest priority was to eat  mate today. Bernoulli\'s gift, Bernoulli\'s little formula, allows us, it tells us how we should thk  a world for which nature never designed us. That explas why we are so bad at usg it, but it also explas why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast. We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate  its hs. We have no significant predators, we\'re the masters  our physical environment; the thgs that normally cause species to become extct are no longer any threat to us.  only thg  the only thg  that can destroy us  doom us are our own decisions. If we\'re not here  10,000 years, it\'s gog to be because we could not take advantage  the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow  1738, because we underestimated the odds  our future pas  overestimated the value  our present pleasures. Thank you. () Chris Anderson: That was remarkable. We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One  two. Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism is  part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,  is there some way that we could counteract that? Dan Gilbert: I actually was consultg recently with the Department  Homel Security, which generally believes that American security dollars should go to makg borders safer. I tried to pot out to them that terrorism was a name based on people\'s psychological reaction to a set  events,  that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror  how can we stop people from beg terrified, rather than  not rather than, but  addition to stoppg the atrocities that we\'re all concerned about. Surely the kds  play that at least American media give to   forgive me, but  raw numbers these are very ty accidents. We already know, for example,  the United States, more people have died as a result  not takg airplanes  because they were scared   drivg on highways, than were killed  9/11. OK? If I told you that there was a plague that was gog to kill 15,000 Americans next year, you might be alarmed if you didn\'t fd out it was the flu. se are smallscale accidents,  we should be wonderg whether they should get the kd  play, the kd  coverage, that they do. Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they\'ll be hurt  these various ways,  gives power to the very people who want to frighten us. CA: Dan, I\'d like to hear more on this. So, you\'re sayg that our response to terror is, I mean, it\'s a form  mental bug? Talk more about it. DG: It\'s outsized. I mean, look. If Australia disappears tomorrow, terror is probably the right response. That\'s an awful large lot  very nice people. On the other h, when a bus blows up  30 people are killed, more people than that were killed by not usg their seatbelts  the same country. Is terror the right response? CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama  the event  that it\'s so spectacular? Is it the fact that it\'s an tentional attack by, quote, outsiders? What is it? DG: Yes. It\'s a number  thgs,  you hit on several  them. First, it\'s a human agent tryg to kill us  it\'s not a tree fallg on us by accident. Second, these are enemies who may want to strike  hurt us aga. People are beg killed for no reason stead  good reason  as if there\'s good reason, but sometimes people thk there are. So there are a number  thgs that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let\'s not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see somethg  it they want to read. So there\'s a large role here played by the media, who want these thgs to be as spectacular as they possibly can. CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it? DG: Well, go to Israel. You know, go to Israel. And a mall blows up,  then everybody\'s unhappy about it,  an hourahalf later  at least when I was there,  I was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up  I went back to my hotel  the weddg that was planned was still gog on. And as the Israeli mother said, she said, ""We never let them w by stoppg weddgs."" I mean, this is a society that has learned   there are others too  that has learned to live with a certa amount  terrorism  not be quite as upset by it, shall I say, as those  us who have not had many terror attacks. CA: But is there a rational fear that actually, the reason we\'re frightened about this is because we thk that the  One is to come? DG: Yes,  course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be, there might be more  more buses  30 people  we would probably not be nearly so frightened. I don\'t want to say  please, I\'m gog to get quoted somewhere as sayg, ""Terrorism is fe  we shouldn\'t be so distressed."" That\'s not my pot at all. What I\'m sayg is that, surely, rationally, our distress about thgs that happen, about threats, should be roughly proportional to the size  those threats  threats to come. I thk  the case  terrorism, it isn\'t. And many  the thgs we\'ve heard about from our speakers today  how many people do you know got up  said, Poverty! I can\'t believe what poverty is dog to us. People get up  the morng; they don\'t care about poverty. It\'s not makg headles, it\'s not makg news, it\'s not flashy. re are no guns gog f. I mean, if you had to solve one  these problems, Chris, which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty? () () That\'s a tough one. CA: re\'s no question. Poverty, by an order  magnitude, a huge order  magnitude, unless someone can show that there\'s, you know, terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.  latest I\'ve read, seen, thought is that it\'s credibly hard for them to do that. If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly, but with poverty it\'s a bit  DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty. CA: We\'ve evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks. Is that because  the past,  the ancient past, we just didn\'t underst thgs like disease  systems that cause poverty  so forth,  so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy to worryg about those thgs? People died; so be it. But if you got attacked, that was somethg you could do somethg about. And so we evolved these responses. Is that what happened? DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical about leapg to evolutionary explanations for everythg are the evolutionary psychologists themselves. My guess is that there\'s nothg quite that specific  our evolutionary past. But rather, if you\'re lookg for an evolutionary explanation, you might say that most organisms are neophobic  that is, they\'re a little scared  stuff that\'s new  different. And there\'s a good reason to be, because old stuff didn\'t eat you. Right? Any animal you see that you\'ve seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you\'ve never seen before. So, you know, when a school bus is blown up  we\'ve never seen this before, our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new  novel is activated. I don\'t thk it\'s quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlyg it. Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about the stupidity  people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect you\'re makg the exact same error you\'re accusg those people , which is the error  value. I know, because I\'ve terviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years. It turns out that the value  buyg a lottery ticket is not wng. That\'s what you thk it is. l right?  average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year, so the buyer knows full well that he or she is gog to lose,  yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that? It\'s not because she is stupid or he is stupid. It\'s because the anticipation  possibly wng releases seroton  the bra,  actually provides a good feelg until the drawg dicates you\'ve lost. Or, to put it another way, for the dollar vestment, you can have a much better feelg than flushg the money down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feelg from. Now, economists tend to  ()  economists tend to view the world through their own lenses, which is: this is just a bunch  stupid people. And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people. And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is, we didn\'t listen to the economists. Thank you very much. () DG: Well, no, it\'s a great pot. It remas to be seen whether the joy  anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount  disappotment after the lottery. Because remember, people who didn\'t buy tickets don\'t feel awful the next day either, even though they don\'t feel great durg the drawg. I would disagree that people know they\'re not gog to w. I thk they thk it\'s unlikely, but it could happen, which is why they prefer that to the flushg. But certaly I see your pot: that there can be some utility to buyg a lottery ticket other than wng. Now, I thk there\'s many good reasons not to listen to economists. That isn\'t one  them, for me, but there\'s many others. CA: Last question. Aubrey de Grey: My name\'s Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge. I work on the thg that kills more people than anythg else kills  I work on agg   I\'m terested  dog somethg about it, as we\'ll all hear tomorrow. I very much resonate with what you\'re sayg, because it seems to me that the problem with gettg people terested  dog anythg about agg is that by the time agg is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice? () DG: For you or for them? AdG: In persuadg them. DG: Ah, for you  persuadg them. Well, it\'s notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted. But one thg that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to image the future more vividly. One  the problems with makg decisions about the far future  the near future is that we image the near future much more vividly than the far future. To the extent that you can equalize the amount  detail that people put to the mental representations  near  far future, people beg to make decisions about the two  the same way. So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you\'re 65 is a question that\'s very different than, image who you\'ll be when you\'re 65: will you be livg, what will you look like, how much hair will you have, who will you be livg with. Once we have all the details  that imagary scenario, suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money. But these are tricks around the margs. I thk  general you\'re battlg a very fundamental human tendency, which is to say, ""I\'m here today,  so now is more important than later."" CA: Dan, thank you. Members  the audience, that was a fantastic session. Thank you. ()"
119,0.0,"In case you are wonderg, no, I\'m not wearg a dress,  no, I\'m not sayg\nwhat I\'m wearg underneath. () This is a gho. This is my national dress. This is how all men dress  Bhutan. That is how our women dress. Like our women, we men get to wear pretty bright colors, but unlike our women, we get to show f our legs. () Our national dress is unique, but this is not the only thg\nthat\'s unique about my country. Our promise to rema\ncarbon neutral is also unique,  this is what I\'d like\nto speak about today, our promise to rema carbon neutral. But before I proceed,\nI should set you the context. I should tell you our story. Bhutan is a small country\n the Himalayas. We\'ve been called ShangriLa, even the last ShangriLa. But let me tell you right f the bat,\nwe are not ShangriLa. My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks. ()  reality is that\nthere are barely 700,000  us swiched between two\n the most populated countries on earth,   India.  reality is that we are a small,\nunderdeveloped country dog our best to survive. But we are dog OK. We are survivg. In fact, we are thrivg,  the reason we are thrivg\nis because we\'ve been blessed with extraordary kgs. Our enlightened monarchs\nhave worked tirelessly to develop our country, balancg economic growth carefully with social development,\nenvironmental sustaability  cultural preservation, all with the framework\n good governance. We call this holistic approach\nto development ""Gross ional Happess,"" or GNH. Back  the 1970s, our fourth kg famously\npronounced that for Bhutan, Gross ional Happess is more important\nthan Gross ional Product. () Ever sce, all development  Bhutan\nis driven by GNH, a pioneerg vision\nthat aims to improve the happess  wellbeg  our people. But that\'s easier said than done, especially when you are one\n the smallest economies  the world. Our entire GDP is less\nthan two billion dollars. I know that some  you here\nare worth more  () dividually than the entire economy  my country. So our economy is small, but here is where it gets terestg. Education is completely free. l citizens are guaranteed\nfree school education,  those that work hard\nare given free college education. Healthcare is also completely free. Medical consultation,\nmedical treatment, medices: they are all provided by the state. We manage this because we use our limited\nresources very carefully,  because we stay faithful\nto the core mission  GNH, which is development with values. Our economy is small,\n we must strengthen it. Economic growth is important, but that economic growth must not come\nfrom undermg our unique culture or our priste environment. Today, our culture is flourishg. We contue to celebrate\nour art  architecture, food  festivals, monks  monasteries. And yes, we celebrate\nour national dress, too. This is why I can wear my gho with pride. Here\'s a fun fact: you\'re lookg\nat the world\'s biggest pocket. () It starts here, goes around the back,  comes out from side here. In this pocket we store all manner  personal goods from phones  wallets to iPads, fice files  books. () () But sometimes  sometimes even precious cargo. So our culture is flourishg, but so is our environment. 72 percent  my country\nis under forest cover. Our constitution dems\nthat a mimum  60 percent  Bhutan\'s total l\nshall rema under forest cover for all time. () Our constitution, this constitution, imposes forest cover on us. Incidentally, our kg\nused this constitution to impose democracy on us. You see, we the people\ndidn\'t want democracy. We didn\'t ask for it, we didn\'t dem it,  we certaly didn\'t fight for it. Instead, our kg imposed democracy on us by sistg that he clude it\n the constitution. But he went further. He cluded provisions  the constitution that empower the people\nto impeach their kgs,  cluded provisions  here\nthat require all our kgs to retire at the age  65. () Fact is, we already have\na kg  retirement: our previous kg, the Great Fourth, retired 10 years ago at the peak  his popularity. He was all  51 years at that time. So as I was sayg, 72 percent  our country\nis under forest cover,  all that forest is priste. That\'s why we are one  the few remag global biodiversity hotspots  the world,  that\'s why we are\na carbon neutral country. In a world that is threatened\nwith climate change, we are a carbon neutral country. Turns out, it\'s a big deal. Of the 200odd countries\n the world today, it looks like we are the only one that\'s carbon neutral. Actually, that\'s not quite accurate. Bhutan is not carbon neutral. Bhutan is carbon negative. Our entire country generates\n2.2 million tons  carbon dioxide, but our forests, they sequester\nmore than three times that amount, so we are a net carbon sk for more than four million tons\n carbon dioxide each year. But that\'s not all. () We export most\n the renewable electricity we generate from our fastflowg rivers. So today, the clean energy that we export fsets about six million tons\n carbon dioxide  our neighborhood. By 2020, we\'ll be exportg\nenough electricity to fset 17 million tons\n carbon dioxide. And if we were to harness\neven half our hydropower potential,  that\'s exactly what we are workg at, the clean, green energy that we export would fset somethg like\n50 million tons  carbon dioxide a year. That is more CO2 than what the entire city\n New York generates  one year. So side our country,\nwe are a net carbon sk. Outside, we are fsettg carbon. And this is important stuff. You see, the world is gettg warmer,  climate change is a reality. Climate change is affectg my country. Our glaciers are meltg, causg flash floods  lslides, which  turn are causg disaster\n widespread destruction  our country. I was at that lake recently. It\'s stunng. That\'s how it looked 10 years ago,  that\'s how it looked 20 years ago. Just 20 years ago, that lake didn\'t exist. It was a solid glacier. A few years ago, a similar lake breached its dams  wreaked havoc  the valleys below. That destruction\nwas caused by one glacier lake. We have 2,700  them to contend with.  pot is this: my country  my people have done nothg to contribute to global warmg, but we are already bearg the brunt\n its consequences. And for a small, poor country,\none that is llocked  mountaous, it is very difficult. But we are not gog to sit\non our hs dog nothg. We will fight climate change. That\'s why we have promised\nto rema carbon neutral. We first made this promise  2009 durg COP 15  Copenhagen, but nobody noticed. Governments were so busy\nargug with one another  blamg each other\nfor causg climate change, that when a small country\nraised our hs  announced, ""We promise to rema\ncarbon neutral for all time,"" nobody heard us. Nobody cared. Last December  Paris, at COP 21, we reiterated our promise to rema carbon neutral\nfor all time to come. This time, we were heard. We were noticed,  everybody cared. What was different  Paris\nwas that governments came round together to accept the realities  climate change,  were willg to come together\n act together  work together. l countries, from the very small\nto the very large, committed to reduce\nthe greenhouse gas emissions.  UN Framework Convention\non Climate Change says that if these socalled\ntended commitments are kept, we\'d be closer\nto contag global warmg by two degrees Celsius. By the way, I\'ve requested the  organizers here to turn up the heat  here\nby two degrees, so if some  you\nare feelg warmer than usual, you know who to blame. It\'s crucial that all  us\nkeep our commitments. As far as Bhutan is concerned, we will keep our promise\nto rema carbon neutral. Here are some  the ways we are dog it. We are providg free electricity\nto our rural farmers.  idea is that, with free electricity,\nthey will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food. We are vestg  sustaable transport  subsidizg the purchase\n electric vehicles. Similarly, we are subsidizg\nthe cost  LED lights,  our entire government\nis tryg to go paperless. We are cleang up our entire country\nthrough Clean Bhutan, a national program,  we are plantg trees\nthroughout our country through Green Bhutan, another national program. But it is our protected areas that are at the core\n our carbon neutral strategy. Our protected areas are our carbon sk. y are our lungs. Today, more than half\nour country is protected, as national parks, nature reserves  wildlife sanctuaries. But the beauty is that we\'ve connected\nthem all with one another through a network  biological corridors. Now, what this means is that our animals are free\nto roam throughout our country. Take this tiger, for example. It was spotted\nat 250 meters above sea level  the hot, subtropical jungles. Two years later, that same tiger was spotted near ,000 meters  our cold alpe mountas. Isn\'t that awesome? () We must keep it that way. We must keep our parks awesome. So every year, we set aside resources\nto prevent poachg, huntg, mg  pollution  our parks,  resources to help communities\nwho live  those parks manage their forests, adapt to climate change,  lead better lives while contug\nto live  harmony with Mother ure. But that is expensive. Over the next few years,\nour small economy won\'t have the resources to cover all the costs that are required\nto protect our environment. In fact, when we run the numbers, it looks like it\'ll take us\nat least 15 years before we can fully fance\nall our conservation efforts. But neither Bhutan, nor the world can afford to spend 15 years\ngog backwards. This is why His Majesty the Kg started Bhutan For Life. Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need. It gives us breathg room. It is essentially a fundg mechanism to look after our parks, to protect our parks, until our government\ncan take over on our own fully.  idea is to raise a transition fund from dividual donors,\ncorporations  stitutions, but the deal is closed only\nafter predetermed conditions are met  all funds committed. So multiparty, sgle closg: an idea we borrowed from  . This means that dividual donors\ncan commit without havg to worry that they\'ll be left\nsupportg an underfunded plan. It\'s somethg like a Kickstarter project, only with a 15year time horizon  millions  tons\n carbon dioxide at stake. Once the deal is closed, we use the transition fund\nto protect our parks, givg our government time\nto crease our own fundg gradually until the end  the 15year period. After that, our government\nguarantees full fundg forever. We are almost there. We expect to close later this year. urally, I\'m pretty excited. ()   Wildlife Fund\nis our prciple partner  this journey,  I want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work\nthey are dog  Bhutan  across the world. () Whew, it is gettg warm  here. I thank you for listeng to our story, a story  how we are keepg\nour promise to rema carbon neutral, a story  how we are keepg\nour country priste, for ourselves, our children, for your children  for the world. But we are not here\nto tell stories, are we? We are here to dream together. So  closg, I\'d like to share\none more dream that I have. What if we could mobilize\nour leadership  our resources, our fluence  our passion, to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea\nto other countries so that they too can conserve their\nprotected areas for all time. After all, there are many other countries\nwho face the same issues that we face. y too have natural resources that can help w the world\'s fight\nfor sustaability, only they may not have the ability\nto vest  them now. So what if we set up Earth For Life, a global fund, to kickstart\nthe Bhutan For Life throughout the world? I vite you to help me, to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care\nabout our planet\'s future. After all, we\'re here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together,\nto protect our planet together. Because the reality is we are  it together. Some  us might dress differently, but we are  it together. Thank you very much,  kadr chhe la. Thank you. () Thank you, thank you, thank you."
120,0.0,"For a really long time, I had two mysteries\nthat were hangg over me. I didn\'t underst them , to be honest, I was quite afraid\nto look to them.  first mystery was, I\'m 0 years old,  all throughout my lifetime,\nyear after year, serious depression  anxiety have risen,  the United States,  Brita,  across the Western world. And I wanted to underst why. Why is this happeng to us? Why is it that with each year that passes, more  more  us are fdg it harder\nto get through the day? And I wanted to underst this\nbecause  a more personal mystery. When I was a teenager, I remember gog to my doctor  explag that I had this feelg,\nlike pa was leakg out  me. I couldn\'t control it, I didn\'t underst why it was happeng, I felt quite ashamed  it. And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was welltentioned, but quite oversimplified. Not totally wrong. My doctor said, ""We know\nwhy people get like this. Some people just naturally get\na chemical imbalance  their heads  you\'re clearly one  them. l we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemical\nbalance back to normal."" So I started takg a drug\ncalled Paxil or Seroxat, it\'s the same thg with different names\n different countries. And I felt much better,\nI got a real boost. But not very long afterwards, this feelg  pa started to come back. So I was given higher  higher doses until, for 13 years, I was takg\nthe maximum possible dose that you\'re legally allowed to take. And for a lot  those 13 years,\n pretty much all the time by the end, I was still  a lot  pa. And I started askg myself,\n""What\'s gog on here? Because you\'re dog everythg you\'re told to do by the story\nthat\'s domatg the culture  why do you still feel like this?"" So to get to the bottom\n these two mysteries, for a book that I\'ve written I ended up gog on a big journey\nall over the world, I traveled over 0,000 miles. I wanted to sit with the leadg\nexperts  the world about what causes depression  anxiety  crucially, what solves them,  people who have come through\ndepression  anxiety  out the other side\n all sorts  ways. And I learned a huge amount from the amazg people\nI got to know along the way. But I thk at the heart\n what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for ne different causes\n depression  anxiety. Two  them are deed  our biology. Your genes can make you\nmore sensitive to these problems, though they don\'t write your desty. And there are real bra changes\nthat can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. But most  the factors\nthat have been proven to cause depression  anxiety are not  our biology. y are factors  the way we live. And once you underst them, it opens up a very different\nset  solutions that should be fered to people alongside the option\n chemical antidepressants. For example, if you\'re lonely, you\'re more likely\nto become depressed. If, when you go to work,\nyou don\'t have any control over your job, you\'ve just got to do what you\'re told, you\'re more likely to become depressed. If you very rarely get out\nto the natural world, you\'re more likely to become depressed. And one thg unites a lot  the causes\n depression  anxiety that I learned about. Not all  them, but a lot  them. Everyone here knows you\'ve all got natural\nphysical needs, right? Obviously. You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. If I took those thgs away from you, you\'d all be  real trouble, real fast. But at the same time, every human beg\nhas natural psychological needs. You need to feel you belong. You need to feel your life\nhas meang  purpose. You need to feel that people\nsee you  value you. You need to feel you\'ve got\na future that makes sense. And this culture we built\nis good at lots  thgs. And many thgs are better\nthan  the past  I\'m glad to be alive today. But we\'ve been gettg less  less good at meetg these deep,\nunderlyg psychological needs. And it\'s not the only thg\nthat\'s gog on, but I thk it\'s the key reason\nwhy this crisis keeps risg  risg. And I found this really hard to absorb. I really wrestled with the idea  shiftg from thkg  my depression\nas just a problem  my bra, to one with many causes, cludg many  the way we\'re livg. And it only really began\nto fall to place for me when one day, I went to terview\na South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. He\'s a great guy. And Dr. Summerfield\nhappened to be  Cambodia  2001, when they first troduced\nchemical antidepressants for people  that country. And the local doctors, the Cambodians,\nhad never heard  these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explaed. And they said to him, ""We don\'t need them,\nwe\'ve already got antidepressants."" And he was like, ""What do you mean?"" He thought they were gog to talk about\nsome kd  herbal remedy, like St. John\'s Wort, gkgo biloba,\nsomethg like that. Instead, they told him a story. re was a farmer  their community\nwho worked  the rice fields. And one day, he stood on a l me left over from the war\nwith the United States,  he got his leg blown f. So they him an artificial leg,  after a while, he went back\nto work  the rice fields. But apparently, it\'s super paful\nto work under water when you\'ve got an artificial limb,  I\'m guessg it was pretty traumatic to go back  work  the field\nwhere he got blown up.  guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out  bed, he developed all the symptoms\n classic depression.  Cambodian doctor said, ""This is when we gave him\nan antidepressant."" And Dr. Summerfield said,\n""What was it?"" y explaed that they went\n sat with him. y listened to him. y realized that his pa made sense  it was hard for him to see it\n the throes  his depression, but actually, it had perfectly\nunderstable causes  his life. One  the doctors, talkg to the people\n the community, figured, ""You know, if we bought this guy a cow, he could become a dairy farmer, he wouldn\'t be  this position\nthat was screwg him up so much, he wouldn\'t have to go\n work  the rice fields."" So they bought him a cow. With a couple  weeks,\nhis cryg stopped, with a month, his depression was gone. y said to doctor Summerfield, ""So you see, doctor, that cow,\nthat was an antidepressant, that\'s what you mean, right?"" () () If you\'d been raised to thk\nabout depression the way I was,  most  the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? ""I went to my doctor\nfor an antidepressant, she gave me a cow."" But what those Cambodian\ndoctors knew tuitively, based on this dividual,\nunscientific anecdote, is what the leadg\nmedical body  the world, the  Health Organization, has been tryg to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. If you\'re depressed, if you\'re anxious, you\'re not weak, you\'re not crazy, you\'re not,  the ma,\na mache with broken parts. You\'re a human beg with unmet needs. And it\'s just as important to thk here\nabout what those Cambodian doctors  the  Health Organization\nare not sayg. y did not say to this farmer, ""Hey, buddy, you need\nto pull yourself together. It\'s your job to figure out\n fix this problem on your own."" On the contrary, what they said is, ""We\'re here as a group\nto pull together with you, so together, we can figure out\n fix this problem."" This is what every depressed person needs,  it\'s what every\ndepressed person deserves. This is why one  the leadg\ndoctors at the United ions,  their ficial statement\nfor  Health Day, couple  years back  2017, said we need to talk less\nabout chemical imbalances  more about the imbalances\n the way we live. Drugs give real relief to some people  they gave relief to me for a while  but precisely because this problem\ngoes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. But when I first learned that, I remember thkg, ""OK, I could see\nall the scientific evidence, I read a huge number  studies, I terviewed a huge number  the experts\nwho were explag this,"" but I kept thkg, ""How can we\npossibly do that?""  thgs that are makg us depressed are  most cases more complex\nthan what was gog on with this Cambodian farmer. Where do we even beg with that sight? But then,  the long journey for my book, all over the world, I kept meetg people\nwho were dog exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo. I kept meetg people\nwho were understg the deeper causes\n depression  anxiety , as groups, fixg them. Obviously, I can\'t tell you\nabout all the amazg people I got to know  wrote about, or all  the ne causes  depression\n anxiety that I learned about, because they won\'t let me give\na 10hour  Talk  you can compla about that to them. But I want to focus on two  the causes  two  the solutions\nthat emerge from them, if that\'s alright. Here\'s the first. We are the loneliest society\n human history. re was a recent study\nthat asked Americans, ""Do you feel like you\'re no longer\nclose to anyone?"" And 39 percent  people\nsaid that described them. ""No longer close to anyone."" In the ternational\nmeasurements  loneless, Brita  the rest  Europe\nare just behd the US,  case anyone here is feelg smug. () I spent a lot  time discussg this with the leadg expert\n the world on loneless, an credible man\nnamed pressor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago,  I thought a lot about one question\nhis work poses to us. Pressor Cacioppo asked, ""Why do we exist? Why are we here, why are we alive?"" One key reason is that our ancestors\non the savannas  Africa were really good at one thg. y weren\'t bigger than the animals\nthey took down a lot  the time, they weren\'t faster than the animals\nthey took down a lot  the time, but they were much better\nat bg together to groups  cooperatg. This was our superpower as a species  we b together, just like bees evolved to live  a hive, humans evolved to live  a tribe. And we are the first humans ever to disb our tribes. And it is makg us feel awful. But it doesn\'t have to be this way. One  the heroes  my book,\n  fact,  my life, is a doctor named Sam Evergton. He\'s a general practitioner\n a poor part  East London, where I lived for many years. And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads  patients comg to him with terrible\ndepression  anxiety. And like me, he\'s not opposed\nto chemical antidepressants, he thks they give\nsome relief to some people. But he could see two thgs. Firstly, his patients were depressed\n anxious a lot  the time for totally understable\nreasons, like loneless. And secondly, although the drugs\nwere givg some relief to some people, for many people,\nthey didn\'t solve the problem.  underlyg problem. One day, Sam decided\nto pioneer a different approach. A woman came to his center,\nhis medical center, called Lisa Cunngham. I got to know Lisa later. And Lisa had been shut away  her home\nwith cripplg depression  anxiety for seven years. And when she came to Sam\'s center,\nshe was told, ""Don\'t worry, we\'ll carry on givg you these drugs, but we\'re also gog to prescribe\nsomethg else. We\'re gog to prescribe for you\nto come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group  other\ndepressed  anxious people, not to talk about how miserable you are, but to figure out somethg\nmeangful you can all do together so you won\'t be lonely  you won\'t feel\nlike life is potless.""  first time this group met, Lisa literally started\nvomitg with anxiety, it was so overwhelmg for her. But people rubbed her back,\nthe group started talkg, they were like, ""What could we do?"" se are nercity,\nEast London people like me, they didn\'t know anythg about gardeng. y were like, ""Why don\'t we\nlearn gardeng?"" re was an area\nbehd the doctors\' fices that was just scrubl. ""Why don\'t we make this to a garden?"" y started to take books\nout  the library, started to watch YouTube clips. y started to get\ntheir fgers  the soil. y started to learn\nthe rhythms  the seasons. re\'s a lot  evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant. But they started to do somethg\neven more important. y started to form a tribe. y started to form a group. y started to care about each other. If one  them didn\'t show up, the others would go\nlookg for them  ""Are you OK?"" Help them figure out\nwhat was troublg them that day.  way Lisa put it to me, ""As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom."" This approach is called\nsocial prescribg, it\'s spreadg all over Europe. And there\'s a small,\nbut growg body  evidence suggestg it can produce real\n meangful falls  depression  anxiety. And one day, I remember\nstg  the garden that Lisa  her oncedepressed\nfriends had built  it\'s a really beautiful garden   havg this thought, it\'s very much spired by a guy\ncalled pressor Hugh Mackay  Australia. I was thkg, so ten\nwhen people feel down  this culture, what we say to them  I\'m sure\neveryone here said it, I have  we say, ""You just need\nto be you, be yourself."" And I\'ve realized, actually,\nwhat we should say to people is, ""Don\'t be you. Don\'t be yourself. Be us, be we. Be part  a group."" ()  solution to these problems does not lie  drawg\nmore  more on your resources as an isolated dividual  that\'s partly what got us  this crisis. It lies on reconnectg\nwith somethg bigger than you. And that really connects\nto one  the other causes  depression  anxiety\nthat I wanted to talk to you about. So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets\n made us physically sick. I don\'t say that\nwith any sense  superiority, I literally came to give\nthis talk from McDonald\'s. I saw all  you eatg that\nhealthy  breakfast, I was like no way. But just like junk food has taken over\nour diets  made us physically sick, a kd  junk values\nhave taken over our mds  made us mentally sick. For thouss  years,\nphilosophers have said, if you thk life is about money,\n status  showg f, you\'re gog to feel like crap. That\'s not an exact quote\nfrom Schopenhauer, but that is the gist  what he said. But weirdly, hardy anyone\nhad scientifically vestigated this, until a  extraordary person\nI got to know, named pressor Tim Kasser, who\'s at Knox College  Illois,  he\'s been researchg this\nfor about 30 years now. And his research suggests\nseveral really important thgs. Firstly, the more you believe you can buy  display\nyour way out  sadness,  to a good life, the more likely you are to become\ndepressed  anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become\nmuch more driven by these beliefs. l throughout my lifetime, under the weight  advertisg\n Instagram  everythg like them. And as I thought about this, I realized it\'s like we\'ve all been fed\nsce birth, a kd  KFC for the soul. We\'ve been traed to look for happess\n all the wrong places,  just like junk food\ndoesn\'t meet your nutritional needs  actually makes you feel terrible, junk values don\'t meet\nyour psychological needs,  they take you away from a good life. But when I first spent time\nwith pressor Kasser  I was learng all this, I felt a really weird mixture  emotions. Because on the one h,\nI found this really challengg. I could see how ten\n my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kd \nshowfy, gr external solution. And I could see why that\ndid not work well for me. I also thought,\nisn\'t this kd  obvious? Isn\'t this almost like banal, right? If I said to everyone here, none  you are gog to lie\non your deathbed  thk about all the shoes you bought\n all the retweets you got, you\'re gog to thk about moments  love, meang\n connection  your life. I thk that seems almost like a cliché. But I kept talkg\nto pressor Kasser  sayg, ""Why am I feelg\nthis strange doubleness?"" And he said, ""At some level,\nwe all know these thgs. But  this culture,\nwe don\'t live by them."" We know them so well\nthey\'ve become clichés, but we don\'t live by them. I kept askg why, why would we know\nsomethg so pround, but not live by it? And after a while,\npressor Kasser said to me, ""Because we live  a mache that is designed to get us to neglect\nwhat is important about life."" I had to really thk about that. ""Because we live  a mache that is designed to get us\nto neglect what is important about life."" And pressor Kasser wanted to figure out\nif we can disrupt that mache. He\'s done loads  research to this; I\'ll tell you about one example,  I really urge everyone here\nto try this with their friends  family. With a guy called han Dungan,\nhe got a group  teenagers  adults to come together for a series  sessions\nover a period  time, to meet up. And part  the pot  the group was to get people to thk\nabout a moment  their life they had actually found\nmeang  purpose. For different people,\nit was different thgs. For some people, it was playg ,\nwritg, helpg someone  I\'m sure everyone here\ncan picture somethg, right? And part  the pot  the group\nwas to get people to ask, ""OK, how could you dedicate\nmore  your life to pursug these moments\n meang  purpose,  less to, I don\'t know,\nbuyg crap you don\'t need, puttg it on social media\n tryg to get people to go, \'OMG, so jealous!\'"" And what they found was, just havg these meetgs, it was like a kd  coholics Anonymous\nfor consumerism, right? Gettg people to have these meetgs,\narticulate these values, determe to act on them\n check  with each other, led to a marked shift  people\'s values. It took them away from this hurricane\n depressiongeneratg messages trag us to seek happess\n the wrong places,  towards more meangful\n nourishg values that lift us out  depression. But with all the solutions that I saw\n have written about,  many I can\'t talk about here, I kept thkg, you know: Why did it take me so long\nto see these sights? Because when you expla them to people  some  them are more\ncomplicated, but not all  when you expla this to people,\nit\'s not like rocket science, right? At some level, we already\nknow these thgs. Why do we fd it so hard to underst? I thk there\'s many reasons. But I thk one reason is\nthat we have to change our understg  what depression\n anxiety actually are. re are very real\nbiological contributions to depression  anxiety. But if we allow the biology\nto become the whole picture, as I did for so long, as I would argue our culture\nhas done pretty much most  my life, what we\'re implicitly sayg to people\nis,  this isn\'t anyone\'s tention, but what we\'re implicitly\nsayg to people is, ""Your pa doesn\'t mean anythg. It\'s just a malfunction. It\'s like a glitch  a computer program, it\'s just a wirg problem  your head."" But I was only able to start\nchangg my life when I realized your depression\nis not a malfunction. It\'s a signal. Your depression is a signal. It\'s tellg you somethg. () We feel this way for reasons,  they can be hard to see\n the throes  depression  I underst that really well\nfrom personal experience. But with the right help,\nwe can underst these problems  we can fix these problems together. But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop sultg these signals by sayg they\'re a sign  weakness,\nor madness or purely biological, except for a ty number  people. We need to start\nlisteng to these signals, because they\'re tellg us\nsomethg we really need to hear. It\'s only when we \nlisten to these signals,  we honor these signals\n respect these signals, that we\'re gog to beg to see the liberatg, nourishg,\ndeeper solutions.  cows that are waitg all around us. Thank you. ()"
121,0.0,"Translator: Timothy Covell\nReviewer: Morton Bast  story starts:\nI was at a friend\'s house,  she had on her shelf\na copy  the DSM manual, which is the manual  mental disorders. It lists every known mental disorder. And it used to be, back  the \'50s,\na very slim pamphlet. And then it got bigger\n bigger  bigger,  now it\'s 886 pages long. And it lists currently\n37 mental disorders. So I was leafg through it, wonderg if I had any mental disorders,  it turns out I\'ve got 12. () I\'ve got generalized anxiety disorder, which is a given. I\'ve got nightmare disorder, which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams  beg\npursued or declared a failure,  all my dreams volve people\nchasg me down the street gog, ""You\'re a failure!"" () I\'ve got parentchild relational problems, which I blame my parents for. () I\'m kiddg. I\'m not kiddg. I\'m kiddg. And I\'ve got malgerg. And I thk it\'s actually quite rare to have both malgerg\n generalized anxiety disorder, because malgerg tends\nto make me feel very anxious. Anyway, I was lookg through this book, wonderg if I was much crazier\nthan I thought I was, or maybe it\'s not a good idea to diagnose\nyourself with a mental disorder if you\'re not a traed pressional, or maybe the psychiatry pression\nhas a kd  strange desire to label what\'s essentially normal\nhuman behavior as a mental disorder. I didn\'t know which  these was true,\nbut I thought it was kd  terestg,  I thought maybe I should\nmeet a critic  psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up havg\nlunch with the Scientologists. () It was a man called Brian,\nwho runs a crack team  Scientologists who are determed to destroy\npsychiatry wherever it lies. y\'re called the CCHR. And I said to him, ""Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudoscience\nthat can\'t be trusted?"" And he said, ""Yes,\nwe can prove it to you."" And I said, ""How?"" And he said, ""We\'re gog\nto troduce you to Tony."" And I said, ""Who\'s Tony?"" And he said, ""Tony\'s  Broadmoor."" Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital. It used to be known as the Broadmoor\nAsylum for the Crimally Insane. It\'s where they send the serial killers,  the people who can\'t help themselves. And I said to Brian,\n""Well, what did Tony do?"" And he said, ""Hardly anythg. He beat someone up or somethg,  he decided to fake madness\nto get out  a prison sentence. But he faked it too well,\n now he\'s stuck  Broadmoor  nobody will believe he\'s sane. Do you want us to try  get you\nto Broadmoor to meet Tony?"" So I said, ""Yes, please."" So I got the tra to Broadmoor. I began to yawn uncontrollably\naround Kempton Park, which apparently is what dogs\nalso do when anxious, they yawn uncontrollably. And we got to Broadmoor. And I got taken through gate\nafter gate after gate after gate to the wellness center, which is where\nyou get to meet the patients. It looks like a giant Hampton Inn. It\'s all peach  pe\n calmg colors. And the only bold colors\nare the reds  the panic buttons. And the patients started driftg . And they were quite overweight\n wearg sweatpants,  quite docilelookg. And Brian the Scientologist\nwhispered to me, ""y\'re medicated,"" which, to the Scientologists,\nis like the worst evil  the world, but I\'m thkg\nit\'s probably a good idea. () And then Brian said, ""Here\'s Tony."" And a man was walkg . And he wasn\'t overweight,\nhe was  very good physical shape. And he wasn\'t wearg sweatpants, he was wearg a pstripe suit. And he had his arm outstretched like someone out   Apprentice. He looked like a man\nwho wanted to wear an outfit that would convce me\nthat he was very sane. And he sat down. And I said, ""So is it true\nthat you faked your way  here?"" And he said, ""Yep. Yep. Absolutely.\nI beat someone up when I was 17. And I was  prison awaitg trial,  my cellmate said to me, \'You know what you have to do? Fake madness. Tell them you\'re mad, you\'ll get\nsent to some cushy hospital. Nurses will brg you pizzas,\nyou\'ll have your own PlayStation.\'"" I said, ""Well, how did you do it?"" He said, ""Well, I asked to see\nthe prison psychiatrist. And I\'d just seen a film called \'Crash,\'  which people get sexual pleasure\nfrom crashg cars to walls. So I said to the psychiatrist, \'I get sexual pleasure\nfrom crashg cars to walls.\'"" And I said, ""What else?"" He said, ""Oh, yeah.\nI told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died, because it would make\nme feel more normal."" I said, ""Where\'d you get that from?"" He said, ""Oh, from a biography\n Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library."" Anyway, he faked madness\ntoo well, he said. And they didn\'t send him\nto some cushy hospital. y sent him to Broadmoor. And the mute he got there, said he took one look at the place,\nasked to see the psychiatrist, said, ""re\'s been\na terrible misunderstg. I\'m not mentally ill."" I said, ""How long have you been here for?"" He said, ""Well, if I\'d just\ndone my time  prison for the origal crime,\nI\'d have got five years. I\'ve been  Broadmoor for 12 years."" Tony said that it\'s a lot harder\nto convce people you\'re sane than it is to convce them you\'re crazy. He said, ""I thought\nthe best way to seem normal would be to talk to people\nnormally about normal thgs like football or what\'s on TV. I subscribe to New Scientist,  recently they had an article about how the U.S. Army was trag\nbumblebees to sniff out explosives. So I said to a nurse, \'Did you know that the U.S. Army\nis trag bumblebees to sniff out explosives?\' When I read my medical notes,\nI saw they\'d written: \'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.\'"" () He said, ""You know, they\'re always\nlookg out for nonverbal clues to my mental state. But how do you sit  a sane way? How do you cross your legs  a sane way? It\'s just impossible."" When Tony said that to me, I thought to myself,\n""Am I sittg like a journalist? Am I crossg my legs like a journalist?"" He said, ""You know, I\'ve got\nthe Stockwell Strangler on one side  me,  I\'ve got the \'Tiptoe\nThrough the Tulips\' rapist on the other side  me. So I tend to stay  my room a lot\nbecause I fd them quite frighteng. And they take that as a sign  madness. y say it proves\nthat I\'m alo  griose."" So, only  Broadmoor would not wantg\nto hang out with serial killers be a sign  madness. Anyway, he seemed completely normal\nto me, but what did I know? And when I got home I emailed\nhis clician, Anthony Maden. I said, ""What\'s the story?"" And he said, ""Yep.\nWe accept that Tony faked madness to get out  a prison sentence,\nbecause his hallucations  that had seemed\nquite cliche to beg with  just vanished the mute\nhe got to Broadmoor. However, we have assessed him,  we\'ve determed that what he is is a psychopath."" And  fact, fakg madness is exactly the kd  cunng\n manipulative act  a psychopath. It\'s on the checklist:\ncunng, manipulative. So, fakg your bra gog wrong is evidence that your bra\nhas gone wrong. And I spoke to other experts,  they said the pstripe\nsuit  classic psychopath  speaks to items one\n two on the checklist: glibness, superficial charm\n griose sense  selfworth. And I said, ""Well, but why didn\'t\nhe hang out with the other patients?"" Classic psychopath  it speaks\nto griosity  also lack  empathy. So all the thgs that had seemed\nmost normal about Tony was evidence, accordg to his clician, that he was mad  this new way. He was a psychopath. And his clician said to me, ""If you\nwant to know more about psychopaths, you can go on a psychopathspottg course run by Robert Hare, who vented\nthe psychopath checklist."" So I did. I went on a psychopathspottg course,  I am now a certified   I have to say, extremely adept \npsychopath spotter. So, here\'s the statistics: One  a hundred regular people\nis a psychopath. So there\'s 1,500 people  his room. Fifteen  you are psychopaths. though that figure rises to four percent\n CEOs  busess leaders, so I thk there\'s a very good chance there\'s about 30 or 0\npsychopaths  this room. It could be carnage\nby the end  the night. () Hare said the reason why\nis because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior  the lack  empathy, the glibness, cunng, manipulative. In fact, capitalism, perhaps\nat its most remorseless, is a physical manifestation\n psychopathy. It\'s like a form  psychopathy\nthat\'s come down to affect us all. Hare said, ""You know what?\nForget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness. Who cares? That\'s not a big story.  big story,"" he said,\n""is corporate psychopathy. You want to go  terview yourself\nsome corporate psychopaths."" So I gave it a try.\nI wrote to the Enron people. I said, ""Could I come\n terview you  prison, to fd out it you\'re psychopaths?"" () And they didn\'t reply. () So I changed tack. I emailed ""Chasaw "" Dunlap, the asset stripper from the 1990s. He would come to failg busesses  close down 30 percent\n the workforce, just turn American towns to ghost towns. And I emailed him  I said, ""I believe you may have\na very special bra anomaly that makes you ... special,  terested  the predatory\nspirit,  fearless. Can I come  terview you\nabout your special bra anomaly?"" And he said, ""Come on over!"" () So I went to  Dunlap\'s\ngr Florida mansion. It was filled with sculptures\n predatory animals. re were lions  tigers \nhe was takg me through the garden  there were falcons  eagles, he was sayg, ""Over there\nyou\'ve got sharks  "" he was sayg this\n a less effemate way  ""You\'ve got more sharks\n you\'ve got tigers."" It was like Narnia. () And then we went to his kitchen. Now,  Dunlap would be brought \nto save failg companies, he\'d close down 30 percent\n the workforce. And he\'d quite ten\nfire people with a joke. Like, for stance,\none famous story about him, somebody came up to him  said,\n""I\'ve just bought myself a new car."" And he said, ""Well,\nyou may have a new car, but I\'ll tell you what you\ndon\'t have  a job."" So  his kitchen  he was  there with his wife, Judy,\n his bodyguard, Sean   I said, ""You know\nhow I said  my email that you might have a special bra\nanomaly that makes you special?"" He said, ""Yeah, it\'s an amazg\ntheory, it\'s like Star Trek. You\'re gog where\nno man has gone before."" And I said, ""Well "" (Clears throat) () Some psychologists might say that this makes you ""\n(Mumbles) () And he said, ""What?"" And I said, ""A psychopath."" And I said, ""I\'ve got a list\n psychopathic traits  my pocket. Can I go through them with you?"" And he looked trigued despite himself,  he said, ""Okay, go on."" And I said, ""Okay.\nGriose sense  selfworth."" Which I have to say, would\nhave been hard for him to deny, because he was stg\nunder a giant oil patg  himself. () He said, ""Well, you\'ve\ngot to believe  you!"" And I said, ""Manipulative."" He said, ""That\'s leadership."" () And I said, ""Shallow affect, an ability to experience\na range  emotions."" He said, ""Who wants to be weighed\ndown by some nonsense emotions?"" So he was gog down\nthe psychopath checklist, basically turng it\nto ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" () But I did notice somethg happeng\nto me the day I was with  Dunlap. Whenever he said anythg to me\nthat was kd  normal  like he said ""no"" to juvenile delquency, he said he got accepted to West Pot,  they don\'t let\ndelquents  West Pot. He said ""no"" to many shortterm\nmarital relationships. He\'s only ever been married twice. Admittedly, his first wife\ncited  her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife  said he always wondered\nwhat human flesh tasted like, but people say stupid thgs to each other  bad marriages\n the heat  an argument,  his second marriage\nhas lasted 1 years. So whenever he said anythg to me\nthat just seemed kd  nonpsychopathic, I thought to myself, well I\'m not\ngog to put that  my book. And then I realized that\nbecomg a psychopath spotter had kd  turned me\na little bit psychopathic. Because I was desperate to shove him\n a box marked ""Psychopath."" I was desperate to defe him\nby his maddest edges. And I realized, my God  this is what I\'ve been dog for 20 years. It\'s what all journalists do. We travel across the world\nwith our notepads  our hs,  we wait for the gems. And the gems are always\nthe outermost aspects  our terviewee\'s personality. And we stitch them together\nlike medieval monks,  we leave the normal\nstuff on the floor. And you know, this is a country\nthat overdiagnoses certa mental disorders hugely. Childhood bipolar  children as young as four\nare beg labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums, which scores them high\non the bipolar checklist. When I got back to London, Tony phoned me. He said, ""Why haven\'t you\nbeen returng my calls?"" I said, ""Well, they say\nthat you\'re a psychopath."" And he said, ""I\'m not a psychopath."" He said, ""You know what? One  the items on the checklist\nis lack  remorse, but another item on the checklist\nis cunng, manipulative. So when you say you feel\nremorse for your crime, they say, \'Typical  the psychopath to cunngly say he feels\nremorse when he doesn\'t.\' It\'s like witchcraft, they turn\neverythg upsidedown."" He said, ""I\'ve got a tribunal comg up. Will you come to it?"" So I said okay. So I went to his tribunal. And after 1 years\n Broadmoor, they let him go. y decided that he shouldn\'t\nbe held defitely because he scores high\non a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater\nthan average chance  recidivism. So they let him go. And outside  the corridor he said to me, ""You know what, Jon? Everyone\'s a bit psychopathic."" He said, ""You are, I am.\nWell, obviously I am."" I said, ""What are you gog to do now?"" He said, ""I\'m gog to go to Belgium. re\'s a woman there that I fancy. But she\'s married, so I\'m gog to have\nto get her split up from her husb."" () Anyway, that was two years ago,  that\'s where my book ended. And for the last 20 months,\neverythg was fe. Nothg bad happened. He was livg with a girl outside London. He was, accordg\nto Brian the Scientologist, makg up for lost time,\nwhich I know sounds omous, but isn\'t necessarily omous. Unfortunately, after 20 months, he did go back to jail for a month. He got to a ""fracas""\n a bar, he called it. Ended up gog to jail for a month,\nwhich I know is bad, but at least a month implies\nthat whatever the fracas was, it wasn\'t too bad. And then he phoned me. And you know what, I thk\nit\'s right that Tony is out. Because you shouldn\'t defe\npeople by their maddest edges. And what Tony is,\nis he\'s a semipsychopath. He\'s a gray area  a world\nthat doesn\'t like gray areas. But the gray areas\nare where you fd the complexity. It\'s where you fd the humanity,  it\'s where you fd the truth. And Tony said to me, ""Jon, could I buy you a drk  a bar? I just want to thank you\nfor everythg you\'ve done for me."" And I didn\'t go. What would you have done? Thank you. ()"
122,0.0,"Okay, now I don\'t want\nto alarm anybody  this room, but it\'s just come to my attention\nthat the person to your right is a liar. () so, the person to your left is a liar. so the person sittg\n your very seats is a liar. We\'re all liars. What I\'m gog to do today is I\'m gog to show you what the research\nsays about why we\'re all liars, how you can become a liespotter  why you might want\nto go the extra mile  go from liespottg to truth seekg,  ultimately to trust buildg. Now, speakg  trust, ever sce I wrote\nthis book, ""Liespottg,"" no one wants to meet me  person\nanymore, no, no, no, no, no. y say, ""It\'s okay, we\'ll email you."" () I can\'t even get\na cfee date at Starbucks. My husb\'s like, ""Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cookg.\nHow about French cookg?"" So before I get started,\nwhat I\'m gog to do is I\'m gog to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game  Gotcha. Liespotters aren\'t those nitpicky kids, those kids  the back  the room\nthat are shoutg, ""Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.\nYou flared your nostril. I watch that TV show \'Lie To Me.\'\nI know you\'re lyg."" No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge\n how to spot deception. y use it to get to the truth,  they do what mature\nleaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations\nwith difficult people, sometimes durg very difficult times. And they start up that path\nby acceptg a core proposition,  that proposition is the followg: Lyg is a cooperative act.  about it, a lie has no power\nwhatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees\nto believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some pot\nyou got lied to, it\'s because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lyg:\nLyg\'s a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we\'re willg\nparticipants  deception for the sake  social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should\nbe kept secret, secret. We say, ""Nice song."" ""Honey, you don\'t look fat  that, no."" Or we say, favorite  the digiratti, ""You know, I just fished\nthat email out  my Spam folder. So sorry."" But there are times when we are unwillg\nparticipants  deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars  corporate fraud alone\n the United States. That\'s an eyelash\nunder a trillion dollars. That\'s seven percent  revenues. Deception can cost billions.  Enron, Madf, the mortgage crisis. Or  the case\n double agents  traitors, like Robert Hanssen or drich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,\nthey can underme democracy, they can cause the deaths\n those that defend us. Deception is actually serious busess. This con man, Henry Oberler,\nhe was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermed the entire\nbankg system  the Western world. And you can\'t fd this guy on Google;\nyou can\'t fd him anywhere. He was terviewed once,\n he said the followg. He said, ""Look, I\'ve got one rule."" And this was Henry\'s rule, he said, ""Look, everyone is willg\nto give you somethg. y\'re ready to give you somethg\nfor whatever it is they\'re hungry for."" And that\'s the crux  it. If you don\'t want to be\ndeceived, you have to know, what is it that you\'re hungry for? And we all kd  hate to admit it. We wish we were\nbetter husbs, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer  the list goes on. Lyg is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes  our fantasies about who we wish we were,\nhow we wish we could be, with what we\'re really like. And boy are we willg to fill \nthose gaps  our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show\nthat you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many  those are white lies. But  another study, it showed that strangers lied three times with the first 10 mutes\n meetg each other. () Now when we first hear\nthis data, we recoil. We can\'t believe how prevalent lyg is. We\'re essentially agast lyg. But if you look more closely,\nthe plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers\nthan we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than troverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves\nthan they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you\'re an average married couple, you\'re gog to lie to your spouse\n one out  every 10 teractions. Now, you may thk that\'s bad. If you\'re unmarried,\nthat number drops to three. Lyg\'s complex. It\'s woven to the fabric\n our daily  our busess lives. We\'re deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an asneeded basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because\nwe don\'t underst the gaps  our lives. That\'s truth number two about lyg. We\'re agast lyg, but we\'re covertly for it  ways that our society has sanctioned\nfor centuries  centuries  centuries. It\'s as old as breathg. It\'s part  our culture,\nit\'s part  our history.  Dante, Shakespeare,\nthe Bible,   the . () Lyg has evolutionary value\nto us as a species. Researchers have long known\nthat the more telligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla\nwho was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate\nvia sign language. Here\'s Koko with her kitten. It\'s her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten\nfor rippg a sk out  the wall. () We\'re hardwired to become\nleaders  the pack. It\'s starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who\'s comg  then go right back to cryg. Oneyearolds learn concealment. () Twoyearolds bluff. Fiveyearolds lie outright. y manipulate via flattery. Neyearolds, masters  the coverup. By the time you enter college, you\'re gog to lie to your mom\n one out  every five teractions. By the time we enter this work world\n we\'re breadwners, we enter a world that is just cluttered\nwith Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, genious identity thieves, worldclass Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic   short, what one author calls\na posttruth society. It\'s been very confusg\nfor a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take\nto navigate our way through the morass. Traed liespotters get to the truth\n90 percent  the time.  rest  us,\nwe\'re only 5 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? re are good liars  bad liars. re are no real origal liars. We all make the same mistakes.\nWe all use the same techniques. So what I\'m gog to do is I\'m gog\nto show you two patterns  deception. And then we\'re gog\nto look at the hot spots  see if we can fd them ourselves. We\'re gog to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clton:\nI want you to listen to me. I\'m gog to say this aga. I did not have sexual relations\nwith that woman, Miss Lewsky. I never told anybody to lie,\nnot a sgle time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work\nfor the American people. Thank you. () Pamela Meyer: Okay,\nwhat were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what\'s known\nas a noncontracted denial. Studies show that people\nwho are overdetermed  their denial will resort to formal rather\nthan formal language. We also heard\ndistancg language: ""that woman."" We know that liars will unconsciously\ndistance themselves from their subject, usg language as their tool. Now if Bill Clton had said,\n""Well, to tell you the truth ..."" or Richard Nixon\'s favorite,\n""In all cor ..."" he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifyg language, as it\'s called,\nqualifyg language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated\nthe question  its entirety, or if he had peppered his account\nwith a little too much detail   we\'re all really glad\nhe didn\'t do that  he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,\nthere\'s much more to it than speech: ""No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,\nhe chatters with his fgertips."" And we all do it no matter\nhow powerful you are. We all chatter with our fgertips. I\'m gog to show you\nDomique StraussKahn with Obama who\'s chatterg with his fgertips. () Now this brgs us to our next pattern,\nwhich is body language. With body language,\nhere\'s what you\'ve got to do. You\'ve really got to just throw\nyour assumptions out the door. Let the science temper\nyour knowledge a little bit. Because we thk liars\nfidget all the time. Well guess what, they\'re known to freeze\ntheir upper bodies when they\'re lyg. We thk liars won\'t look you  the eyes. Well guess what, they look\nyou  the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We thk warmth  smiles\nconvey honesty, scerity. But a traed liespotter\ncan spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract\nthe muscles  your cheeks. But the real smile\'s  the eyes,\nthe crow\'s feet  the eyes. y cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don\'t overdo the Botox;\nnobody will thk you\'re honest. Now we\'re gog to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what\'s happeng\n a conversation? Can you start to fd the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone\'s words\n someone\'s actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you\'re havg a conversation\nwith someone you suspect  deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked\nbut tellg  dicators. An honest person\nis gog to be cooperative. y\'re gog to show\nthey\'re on your side. y\'re gog to be enthusiastic. y\'re gog to be willg  helpful\nto gettg you to the truth. y\'re gog to be willg\nto brastorm, name suspects, provide details. y\'re gog to say, ""Hey, maybe it was those guys  payroll\nthat forged those checks."" y\'re gog to be furiated\nif they sense they\'re wrongly accused throughout the entire course\n the terview, not just  flashes; they\'ll be furiated throughout\nthe entire course  the terview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen\nto whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather\nthan lenient punishment. Now let\'s say you\'re havg\nthat exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kd  herkyjerky. Ask a deceptive person\nto tell their story, they\'re gog to pepper it\nwith way too much detail  all kds  irrelevant places. And then they\'re gog to tell their story\n strict chronological order. And what a traed terrogator does is they come    very subtle ways\nover the course  several hours, they will ask that person\nto tell that story backwards,  then they\'ll watch them squirm,  track which questions produce\nthe highest volume  deceptive tells. Why do they do that?\nWell, we all do the same thg. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say ""yes,"" we shake our heads ""no."" We tell very convcg stories,\nwe slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes,  we smile at the delight\n gettg away with it. Now, that smile is known\n the trade as ""dupg delight."" And we\'re gog to see that\n several videos movg forward, but we\'re gog to start \nfor those  you who don\'t know him, this is presidential\ncidate John Edwards who shocked America by fatherg\na child out  wedlock. We\'re gog to see him talk\nabout gettg a paternity test. See now if you can spot him\nsayg, ""yes"" while shakg his head ""no,"" slightly shruggg his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I\'d be happy\nto participate  one. I know that it\'s not possible\nthat this child could be me, because  the timg  events. So I know it\'s not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,\n would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you gog to do\nthat soon? Is there somebody  JE: Well, I\'m only one side.\nI\'m only one side  the test. But I\'m happy to participate  one. PM: Okay, those head shakes\nare much easier to spot once you know to look for them. re are gog to be times\nwhen someone makes one expression while maskg another that just\nkd  leaks through  a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new jot venture partner\nmight shake your h, celebrate, go out to dner with you\n then leak an expression  anger. And we\'re not all gog to become\nfacial expression experts overnight here, but there\'s one I can teach you\nthat\'s very dangerous  it\'s easy to learn,  that\'s the expression  contempt. Now with anger, you\'ve got\ntwo people on an even playg field. It\'s still somewhat\n a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,\nyou\'ve been dismissed. It\'s associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it\'s very,\nvery hard to recover from. Here\'s what it looks like. It\'s marked by one lip corner\npulled up  . It\'s the only asymmetrical expression. And  the presence  contempt,\nwhether or not deception follows   it doesn\'t always follow  look the other way,\ngo the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, ""No thank you. I\'m not comg up\nfor just one more nightcap. Thank you.""  has surfaced\nmany, many more dicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blk rate, pot their feet towards an exit. y will take barrier objects  put them between themselves\n the person that is terviewg them. y\'ll alter their vocal tone, ten makg their vocal tone much lower. Now here\'s the deal. se behaviors are just behaviors. y\'re not pro  deception. y\'re red flags. We\'re human begs. We make deceptive flailg gestures\nall over the place all day long. y don\'t mean anythg\n   themselves. But when you see clusters\n them, that\'s your signal. Look, listen, probe,\nask some hard questions, get out  that very comfortable\nmode  knowg, walk to curiosity mode,\nask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person\nyou\'re talkg to with rapport. Don\'t try to be like those folks\non ""Law & Order""  those other TV shows that pummel their subjects\nto submission. Don\'t be too aggressive, it doesn\'t work. Now, we\'ve talked a little bit\nabout how to talk to someone who\'s lyg  how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we\'re now gog\nto look at what the truth looks like. But I\'m gog to show you two videos, two mothers  one is lyg,\none is tellg the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher\nDavid Matsumoto  California. And I thk they\'re an excellent example\n what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital\nwhile they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggyhaired stranger did it. And you\'ll see when you see the video, she can\'t even pretend\nto be an agonizg mother. What you want to look for here\nis an credible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes\n her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you\'ll see\ndupg delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:\nAt night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reachg\nher h out to me while I\'m drivg,  the blood just kept\ncomg out  her mouth. And that  maybe\nit\'ll fade too with time  but I don\'t thk so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I\'m gog to show you a video  an actual grievg mother,\nEr Runnion, confrontg her daughter\'s murderer\n torturer  court. Here you\'re gog to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression\n a mother\'s agony. (Video) Er Runnion:\nI wrote this statement on the third anniversary\n the night you took my baby,  you hurt her,  you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought,  I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you\nwith those amazg brown eyes,  you still wanted to kill her. And I don\'t underst it,  I never will. PM: Okay, there\'s no doubtg\nthe veracity  those emotions. Now the technology\naround what the truth looks like is progressg on, the science  it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers\n frared bra scans, MRI\'s that can decode the signals\nthat our bodies send out when we\'re tryg to be deceptive. And these technologies are gog\nto be marketed to all  us as panaceas for deceit,  they will prove\ncredibly useful some day. But you\'ve got to ask yourself\n the meantime: Who do you want on your side\n the meetg, someone who\'s traed\n gettg to the truth or some guy who\'s gog to drag\na 00pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. y know, as someone once said, ""Character\'s who you are  the dark."" And what\'s kd  terestg\nis that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 2 hours a day. It\'s transparent\nwith blogs  social networks broadcastg the buzz\n a whole new generation  people that have made a choice to live\ntheir lives  public. It\'s a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharg, that\'s not honesty. Our manic tweetg  textg\ncan bld us to the fact that the subtleties\n human decency  character tegrity  that\'s still what matters,\nthat\'s always what\'s gog to matter. So  this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit\nabout our moral code. When you combe the science\n recognizg deception with the art  lookg, listeng, you exempt yourself\nfrom collaboratg  a lie. You start up that path\n beg just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, ""Hey, my world, our world,\nit\'s gog to be an honest one. My world is gog to be\none where truth is strengthened  falsehood is recognized\n margalized."" And when you do that, the ground around you starts\nto shift just a little bit. And that\'s the truth. Thank you. ()"
123,0.0,"So  college, I was a government major, which means I had to write\na lot  papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out\na little like this. So, you know  () you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done  the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everythg gets done, thgs stay civil. () And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper\nwould come along,  then I would kd  do this. () And that would happen every sgle paper. But then came my 90page senior thesis, a paper you\'re supposed\nto spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that,\nmy normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned thgs out,  I decided I kd  had\nto go somethg like this. This is how the year would go. So I\'d start f light,  I\'d bump it up  the middle months,  then at the end,\nI would kick it up to high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be\nto walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thg happened. Those first few months? y came  went,  I couldn\'t quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. () And then  () But then those middle months\nactually went by,  I didn\'t really write words,  so we were here. And then two months turned to one month, which turned to two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadle, still not havg written a word,  so I did the only thg I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pullg not one but two allnighters  humans are not supposed to pull\ntwo allnighters  sprted across campus, dove  slow motion,  got it  just at the deadle. I thought that was the end  everythg. But a week later I get a call,  it\'s the school. And they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?"" And I say, ""Yeah."" And they say, ""We need\nto talk about your thesis."" And I say, ""OK."" And they say, ""It\'s the best one we\'ve ever seen."" () () That did not happen. () It was a very, very bad thesis. () I just wanted to enjoy that one moment\nwhen all  you thought, ""This guy is amazg!"" () No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I\'m a writerblogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple  years ago,\nI decided to write about procrastation. My behavior has always perplexed\nthe nonprocrastators around me,  I wanted to expla\nto the nonprocrastators  the world what goes on  the heads\n procrastators,  why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the bras  procrastators\nwere actually different than the bras  other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my bra  the bra  a proven\nnonprocrastator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here\nto show you today. I want you to take a look carefully\nto see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you\'re not\na traed bra expert, it\'s not that obvious,\nbut just take a look, OK? So here\'s the bra\n a nonprocrastator. () Now ... here\'s my bra. () re is a difference. Both bras have a Rational\nDecisionMaker  them, but the procrastator\'s bra also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean\nfor the procrastator? Well, it means everythg\'s fe\nuntil this happens. [This is a perfect time\nto get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational DecisionMaker\nwill make the rational decision to do somethg productive, but the Monkey doesn\'t like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel,  he says, ""Actually, let\'s read\nthe entire Wikipedia page  the Nancy Kerrigan/\nTonya Hardg scal, because I just remembered\nthat that happened. () n  () n we\'re gog to go over to the fridge, to see if there\'s anythg new\n there sce 10 mutes ago.

() ""l  that\'s gog to take a while, so we\'re not gog to really have room\non the schedule for any work today. Sorry!"" (Sigh) Now, what is gog on here?  Instant Gratification Monkey\ndoes not seem like a guy you want behd the wheel. He lives entirely  the present moment. He has no memory  the past,\nno knowledge  the future,  he only cares about two thgs: easy  fun. Now,  the animal world, that works fe. If you\'re a dog  you spend your whole life dog\nnothg other than easy  fun thgs, you\'re a huge success! () And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep wellslept, wellfed\n propagatg to the next generation, which  tribal times\nmight have worked OK. But, if you haven\'t noticed,\nnow we\'re not  tribal times. We\'re  an advanced civilization,\n the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have\nanother guy  our bra, the Rational DecisionMaker, who gives us the ability to do thgs\nno other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make longterm plans. And he wants to take\nall  that to account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense\nto be dog right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be dog thgs that are easy  fun, like when you\'re havg dner\nor gog to bed or enjoyg wellearned leisure time. That\'s why there\'s an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be dog thgs that are harder\n less pleasant, for the sake  the big picture. And that\'s when we have a conflict. And for the procrastator, that conflict tends to end\na certa way every time, leavg him spendg a lot  time\n this orange zone, an easy  fun place that\'s entirely\nout  the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. () Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all  you procrastators\nout there know very well. It\'s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities\nare not supposed to be happeng.  fun you have  the Dark Playground isn\'t actually fun,\nbecause it\'s completely unearned,  the air is filled with guilt,\ndread, anxiety, selfhatred  all  those good procrastator feelgs. And the question is,  this situation,\nwith the Monkey behd the wheel, how does the procrastator ever get\nhimself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where\nreally important thgs happen? Well, turns out the procrastator\nhas a guardian angel, someone who\'s always lookg\ndown on him  watchg over him  his darkest moments  someone called the Panic Monster. () Now, the Panic Monster\nis dormant most  the time, but he suddenly wakes up\nanytime a deadle gets too close or there\'s danger  public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other\nscary consequence. And importantly, he\'s the only thg\nthe Monkey is terrified . Now, he became very relevant\n my life pretty recently, because the people  \nreached out to me about six months ago  vited me to do a  Talk. () Now,  course, I said yes. It\'s always been a dream  me\nto have done a  Talk  the past. () () But  the middle  all this excitement, the Rational DecisionMaker seemed\nto have somethg else on his md. He was sayg, ""Are we clear\non what we just accepted? Do we get what\'s gog to be now\nhappeng one day  the future? We need to sit down\n work on this right now."" And the Monkey said, ""Totally agree,\nbut let\'s just open Google Earth  zoom  to the bottom  India,\nlike 200 feet above the ground,  scroll up for two  a half hours\ntil we get to the top  the country, so we can get a better feel for India."" () So that\'s what we did that day. () As six months turned to four\n then two  then one, the people   decided\nto release the speakers. And I opened up the website,\n there was my face starg right back at me. And guess who woke up? () So the Panic Monster\nstarts losg his md,  a few seconds later,\nthe whole system\'s  mayhem. () And the Monkey  remember,\nhe\'s terrified  the Panic Monster  boom, he\'s up the tree! And fally, fally, the Rational DecisionMaker\ncan take the wheel  I can start workg on the talk. Now, the Panic Monster explas all kds  pretty sane\nprocrastator behavior, like how someone like me\ncould spend two weeks unable to start the openg\nsentence  a paper,  then miraculously fd\nthe unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night\n write eight pages. And this entire situation,\nwith the three characters  this is the procrastator\'s system. It\'s not pretty, but  the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about\non the blog a couple  years ago. When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thouss  emails came , from all different kds  people\nfrom all over the world, dog all different kds  thgs. se are people who were nurses,\nbankers, paters, engeers  lots  lots  PhD students. () And they were all writg,\nsayg the same thg: ""I have this problem too."" But what struck me was the contrast\nbetween the light tone  the post  the heavess  these emails. se people were writg\nwith tense frustration about what procrastation\nhad done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this,  I said, well, if the procrastator\'s system\nworks, then what\'s gog on? Why are all  these people\n such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there\'s\ntwo kds  procrastation. Everythg I\'ve talked about today,\nthe examples I\'ve given, they all have deadles. And when there\'s deadles, the effects  procrastation\nare contaed to the short term because the Panic Monster gets volved. But there\'s a second kd\n procrastation that happens  situations\nwhen there is no deadle. So if you wanted a career\nwhere you\'re a selfstarter  somethg  the arts,\nsomethg entrepreneurial  there\'s no deadles on those thgs\nat first, because nothg\'s happeng, not until you\'ve gone out\n done the hard work to get momentum, get thgs gog. re\'s also all kds  important thgs\noutside  your career that don\'t volve any deadles, like seeg your family or exercisg\n takg care  your health, workg on your relationship or gettg out  a relationship\nthat isn\'t workg. Now if the procrastator\'s only mechanism\n dog these hard thgs is the Panic Monster, that\'s a problem, because  all  these\nnondeadle situations, the Panic Monster doesn\'t show up. He has nothg to wake up for, so the effects  procrastation,\nthey\'re not contaed; they just extend outward forever. And it\'s this longterm\nkd  procrastation that\'s much less visible\n much less talked about than the funnier, shortterm\ndeadlebased kd. It\'s usually suffered\nquietly  privately. And it can be the source  a huge amount  longterm\nunhappess,  regrets. And I thought, that\'s why\nthose people are emailg,  that\'s why they\'re\n such a bad place. It\'s not that they\'re crammg\nfor some project. It\'s that longterm procrastation\nhas made them feel like a spectator, at times,  their own lives.  frustration is not\nthat they couldn\'t achieve their dreams; it\'s that they weren\'t even\nable to start chasg them. So I read these emails\n I had a little bit  an epiphany  that I don\'t thk\nnonprocrastators exist. That\'s right  I thk all  you\nare procrastators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some  us, ()  some  you may have\na healthy relationship with deadles, but remember: the Monkey\'s sneakiest trick is when the deadles aren\'t there. Now, I want to show you one last thg. I call this a Life Calendar. That\'s one box for every week\n a 90year life. That\'s not that many boxes, especially sce we\'ve already\nused a bunch  those. So I thk we need to all take a long,\nhard look at that calendar. We need to thk about what\nwe\'re really procrastatg on, because everyone is procrastatg\non somethg  life. We need to stay aware\n the Instant Gratification Monkey. That\'s a job for all  us. And because there\'s not\nthat many boxes on there, it\'s a job that should\nprobably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... () You know. Sometime soon. Thank you. ()"
124,0.0,"When I was ne years old, I went f to summer camp\nfor the first time. And my mother packed me a suitcase\nfull  books, which to me seemed like\na perfectly natural thg to do. Because  my family,\nreadg was the primary group activity. And this might sound antisocial to you, but for us it was really just\na different way  beg social. You have the animal warmth  your family\nsittg right next to you, but you are also free to go\nroamg around the adventurel side your own md. And I had this idea that camp was gog to be\njust like this, but better. () I had a vision  10 girls\nsittg  a cab cozily readg books\n their matchg nightgowns. () Camp was more like a keg party\nwithout any alcohol. And on the very first day, our counselor gathered us all together  she taught us a cheer\nthat she said we would be dog every day for the rest  the summer\nto still camp spirit. And it went like this: ""ROWDIE, that\'s the way we spell rowdie. Rowdie, rowdie, let\'s get rowdie."" () Yeah. So I couldn\'t figure out\nfor the life  me why we were supposed to be so rowdy, or why we had to spell\nthis word correctly. () But I recited a cheer. I recited\na cheer along with everybody else. I did my best. And I just waited for the time\nthat I could go f  read my books. But the first time that I took\nmy book out  my suitcase, the coolest girl  the bunk came up to me  she asked me, ""Why\nare you beg so mellow?""  mellow,  course,\nbeg the exact opposite  ROWDIE. And then the second time I tried it, the counselor came up to me\nwith a concerned expression on her face  she repeated the pot\nabout camp spirit  said we should all work very hard\nto be outgog. And so I put my books away, back  their suitcase,  I put them under my bed,  there they stayed\nfor the rest  the summer. And I felt kd  guilty about this. I felt as if the books needed me somehow,  they were callg out to me\n I was forsakg them. But I did forsake them\n I didn\'t open that suitcase aga until I was back home with my family\nat the end  the summer. Now, I tell you this story\nabout summer camp. I could have told you\n50 others just like it  all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet\n troverted style  beg was not necessarily the right way to go, that I should be tryg to pass\nas more  an extrovert. And I always sensed deep down\nthat this was wrong  that troverts were\npretty excellent just as they were. But for years I denied this tuition,  so I became a  \nlawyer,  all thgs, stead  the writer\nthat I had always longed to be  partly because I needed to prove to myself\nthat I could be bold  assertive too. And I was always gog f to crowded bars when I really would have preferred\nto just have a nice dner with friends. And I made these\nselfnegatg choices so reflexively, that I wasn\'t even aware\nthat I was makg them. Now this is what many troverts do,  it\'s our loss for sure, but it is also our colleagues\' loss  our communities\' loss. And at the risk  soundg griose,\nit is the world\'s loss. Because when it comes\nto creativity  to leadership, we need troverts dog\nwhat they do best. A third to a half  the population\nare troverts  a third to a half. So that\'s one out  every two\nor three people you know. So even if you\'re an extrovert yourself, I\'m talkg about your coworkers  your spouses  your children  the person sittg\nnext to you right now  all  them subject to this bias that is pretty deep\n real  our society. We all ternalize it\nfrom a very early age without even havg a language\nfor what we\'re dog. Now, to see the bias clearly, you need to underst\nwhat troversion is. It\'s different from beg shy. Shyness is about fear  social judgment. Introversion is more about, how do you respond to stimulation, cludg social stimulation. So extroverts really crave\nlarge amounts  stimulation, whereas troverts feel\nat their most alive  their most switchedon\n their most capable when they\'re  quieter,\nmore lowkey environments. Not all the time \nthese thgs aren\'t absolute  but a lot  the time. So the key then to maximizg our talents is for us all to put ourselves  the zone  stimulation\nthat is right for us. But now here\'s where the bias comes . Our most important stitutions, our schools  our workplaces, they are designed mostly for extroverts  for extroverts\' need\nfor lots  stimulation. And also we have\nthis belief system right now that I call the new groupthk, which holds that all creativity\n all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place. So if you picture the typical\nclassroom nowadays: When I was gog to school,\nwe sat  rows. We sat  rows  desks like this,  we did most  our work\npretty autonomously. But nowadays, your typical classroom\nhas pods  desks  four or five or six or seven kids\nall facg each other. And kids are workg\n countless group assignments. Even  subjects like math\n creative writg, which you thk would depend\non solo flights  thought, kids are now expected to act\nas committee members. And for the kids who prefer to go f\nby themselves or just to work alone, those kids are seen as outliers ten or, worse, as problem cases. And the vast majority  teachers reports believg that\nthe ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an trovert, even though troverts\nactually get better grades  are more knowledgeable, accordg to research. () Okay, same thg is true\n our workplaces. Now, most  us work  open plan fices, without walls, where we are subject to the constant\nnoise  gaze  our coworkers. And when it comes to leadership, troverts are routely passed over\nfor leadership positions, even though troverts\ntend to be very careful, much less likely to take outsize risks  which is somethg\nwe might all favor nowadays. And terestg research\nby Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that troverted leaders ten deliver better outcomes\nthan extroverts do, because when they are managg\nproactive employees, they\'re much more likely to let\nthose employees run with their ideas, whereas an extrovert\ncan, quite unwittgly, get so excited about thgs that they\'re puttg\ntheir own stamp on thgs,  other people\'s ideas might not\nas easily then bubble up to the surface. Now  fact, some  our transformative\nleaders  history have been troverts. I\'ll give you some examples. Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Ghi  all these people described themselves\nas quiet  stspoken  even shy. And they all took the spotlight, even though every bone  their bodies\nwas tellg them not to. And this turns out to have\na special power all its own, because people could feel\nthat these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directg others  not out  the pleasure\n beg looked at; they were there\nbecause they had no choice, because they were driven to do\nwhat they thought was right. Now I thk at this pot\nit\'s important for me to say that I actually love extroverts. I always like to say some  my best\nfriends are extroverts, cludg my beloved husb. And we all fall\nat different pots,  course, along the trovert/extrovert spectrum. Even Carl Jung, the psychologist\nwho first popularized these terms, said that there\'s no such thg\nas a pure trovert or a pure extrovert. He said that such a man\nwould be  a lunatic asylum, if he existed at all. And some people fall smack  the middle\n the trovert/extrovert spectrum,  we call these people ambiverts. And I ten thk that they have\nthe best  all worlds. But many  us do recognize\nourselves as one type or the other. And what I\'m sayg is that culturally,\nwe need a much better balance. We need more  a y  yang\nbetween these two types. This is especially important when it comes to creativity\n to productivity, because when psychologists look\nat the lives  the most creative people, what they fd are people who are very good\nat exchangg ideas  advancg ideas, but who also have a serious\nstreak  troversion  them. And this is because solitude is a crucial gredient\nten to creativity. So Darw, he took long walks alone  the woods  emphatically turned down\ndnerparty vitations. odor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, he dreamed up many\n his amazg creations  a lonely bell tower fice that he had  the back  his house\n La Jolla, California. And he was actually afraid to meet\nthe young children who read his books for fear that they were expectg him\nthis kd  jolly Santa Clauslike figure  would be disappoted\nwith his more reserved persona. Steve Wozniak vented\nthe first Apple computer sittg alone  his cubicle\n HewlettPackard where he was workg at the time. And he says that he never would have\nbecome such an expert  the first place had he not been too troverted\nto leave the house when he was growg up. Now,  course, this does not mean that we should\nall stop collaboratg   case  pot, is Steve Wozniak\nfamously comg together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer  but it does mean that solitude matters  that for some people\nit is the air that they breathe. And  fact, we have known for centuries\nabout the transcendent power  solitude. It\'s only recently that\nwe\'ve strangely begun to forget it. If you look at most\n the world\'s major religions, you will fd seekers  Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad  seekers who are gog f by themselves\nalone to the wilderness, where they then have pround\nepiphanies  revelations that they then brg back\nto the rest  the community. So, no wilderness, no revelations. This is no surprise, though, if you look at the sights\n contemporary psychology. It turns out that we can\'t\neven be  a group  people without stctively mirrorg,\nmimickg their opions. Even about seemgly\npersonal  visceral thgs like who you\'re attracted to, you will start apg the beliefs\n the people around you without even realizg\nthat that\'s what you\'re dog. And groups famously follow the opions  the most domant\nor charismatic person  the room, even though there\'s zero correlation between beg the best talker\n havg the best ideas  I mean zero. So  () You might be followg the person\nwith the best ideas, but you might not. And do you really want\nto leave it up to chance? Much better for everybody\nto go f by themselves, generate their own ideas freed from the distortions\n group dynamics,  then come together as a team to talk them through\n a wellmanaged environment  take it from there. Now if all this is true, then why are we gettg it so wrong? Why are we settg up our schools\nthis way,  our workplaces? And why are we makg\nthese troverts feel so guilty about wantg to just go f\nby themselves some  the time? One answer lies deep\n our cultural history. Western societies,   particular the U.S., have always favored the man  action\nover the ""man""  contemplation. But  America\'s early days, we lived  what historians\ncall a culture  character, where we still,\nat that pot, valued people for their ner selves\n their moral rectitude. And if you look at the selfhelp\nbooks from this era, they all had titles with thgs like ""Character, the Grest\nThg  the ."" And they featured role models\nlike Abraham Lcoln, who was praised for beg\nmodest  unassumg. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him ""A man who does not\nfend by superiority."" But then we hit the 20th century,  we entered a new culture that historians call\nthe culture  personality. What happened is we had evolved\nan agricultural economy to a world  big busess. And so suddenly people are movg\nfrom small towns to the cities. And stead  workg alongside people\nthey\'ve known all their lives, now they are havg to prove themselves\n a crowd  strangers. So, quite understably, qualities like magnetism  charisma\nsuddenly come to seem really important. And sure enough, the selfhelp books\nchange to meet these new needs  they start to have names like ""How to W \n Influence People."" And they feature as their role models\nreally great salesmen. So that\'s the world we\'re livg  today. That\'s our cultural heritance. Now none  this is to say\nthat social skills are unimportant,  I\'m also not callg\nfor the abolishg  teamwork at all.  same religions who send their sages\nf to lonely mounta tops also teach us love  trust. And the problems that we are facg today  fields like science   economics are so vast  so complex that we are gog to need armies\n people comg together to solve them workg together. But I am sayg that the more freedom\nthat we give troverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique\nsolutions to these problems. So now I\'d like to share with you\nwhat\'s  my suitcase today. Guess what? Books. I have a suitcase full  books. Here\'s Margaret Atwood, ""Cat\'s Eye."" Here\'s a novel by Milan Kundera. And here\'s "" Guide for the Perplexed""\nby Maimonides. But these are not exactly my books. I brought these books with me because they were written\nby my grfather\'s favorite authors. My grfather was a rabbi  he was a widower who lived alone  a small\napartment  Brooklyn that was my favorite place\n the world when I was growg up, partly because it was filled with\nhis very gentle, very courtly presence  partly because\nit was filled with books. I mean literally every table,\nevery chair  this apartment had yielded its origal function to now serve as a surface\nfor swayg stacks  books. Just like the rest  my family, my grfather\'s favorite thg to do\n the whole world was to read. But he also loved his congregation,  you could feel this love\n the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years\nthat he was a rabbi. He would takes the fruits\n each week\'s readg  he would weave these tricate tapestries\n ancient  humanist thought. And people would come from all over\nto hear him speak. But here\'s the thg about my grfather. Underneath this ceremonial role, he was really modest\n really troverted  so much so that when\nhe delivered these sermons, he had trouble makg eye contact with the very same congregation\nthat he had been speakg to for 62 years. And even away from the podium, when you called him to say hello, he would ten end\nthe conversation prematurely for fear that he was takg up\ntoo much  your time. But when he died at the age  9, the police had to close down\nthe streets  his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd  people\nwho came out to mourn him. And so these days I try to learn\nfrom my grfather\'s example  my own way. So I just published a book\nabout troversion,  it took me about seven years to write. And for me, that seven years\nwas like total bliss, because I was readg, I was writg, I was thkg, I was researchg. It was my version  my grfather\'s hours\n the day alone  his library. But now all  a sudden\nmy job is very different,  my job is to be\nout here talkg about it, talkg about troversion. () And that\'s a lot harder for me, because as honored as I am\nto be here with all  you right now, this is not my natural milieu. So I prepared for moments\nlike these as best I could. I spent the last year\npracticg public speakg every chance I could get. And I call this my ""year\n speakg dangerously."" () And that actually helped a lot. But I\'ll tell you, what helps even more is my sense, my belief, my hope\nthat when it comes to our attitudes to troversion  to quiet\n to solitude, we  are poised on the brk\non dramatic change. I mean, we are. And so I am gog to leave you now with three calls for action\nfor those who share this vision. Number one: Stop the madness for constant group work. Just stop it. () Thank you. () And I want to be clear\nabout what I\'m sayg, because I deeply believe our fices should be encouragg casual, chatty\ncafestyle types  teractions  you know, the kd\nwhere people come together  serendipitously have\nan exchange  ideas. That is great. It\'s great for troverts\n it\'s great for extroverts. But we need much more privacy\n much more freedom  much more autonomy at work. School, same thg. We need to be teachg kids\nto work together, for sure, but we also need to be teachg them\nhow to work on their own. This is especially important\nfor extroverted children too. y need to work on their own because that is where deep thought\ncomes from  part. Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness. Be like Buddha, have your own revelations. I\'m not sayg that we all have to now go f  build\nour own cabs  the woods  never talk to each other aga, but I am sayg that we could\nall st to unplug  get side our own heads\na little more ten. Number three: Take a good look\nat what\'s side your own suitcase  why you put it there. So extroverts, maybe your suitcases\nare also full  books. Or maybe they\'re full  champagne glasses\nor skydivg equipment. Whatever it is, I hope you take\nthese thgs out every chance you get  grace us with your energy\n your joy. But troverts, you beg you, you probably have the impulse\nto guard very carefully what\'s side your own suitcase. And that\'s okay. But occasionally, just occasionally, I hope you will open up your suitcases\nfor other people to see, because the world needs you  it\nneeds the thgs you carry. So I wish you the best\n all possible journeys  the courage to speak stly. Thank you very much. () Thank you. Thank you. ()"
125,0.0,"Chris Anderson:\nElon, hey, welcome back to . It\'s great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for havg me. CA: So,  the next half hour or so, we\'re gog to spend some time explorg your vision for what\nan excitg future might look like, which I guess makes\nthe first question a little ironic: Why are you borg? EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We\'re tryg to dig a hole under LA,  this is to create the begng  what will hopefully\nbe a 3D network  tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one  the most\nsouldestroyg thgs is traffic. It affects people\n every part  the world. It takes away so much  your life. It\'s horrible. It\'s particularly horrible  LA. () CA: I thk you\'ve brought with you the first visualization\nthat\'s been shown  this. Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.\nSo this is the first time  Just to show what we\'re talkg about. So a couple  key thgs\nthat are important  havg a 3D tunnel network. First  all, you have to be able to tegrate the entrance\n exit  the tunnel seamlessly to the fabric  the city. So by havg an elevator, sort  a car skate,\nthat\'s on an elevator, you can tegrate the entrance\n exits to the tunnel network just by usg two parkg spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. re\'s no speed limit here, so we\'re designg this to be able\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\nor about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able\nto get from, say, Westwood to LAX  six mutes  five, six mutes. () CA: So possibly, itially done, it\'s like on a sort\n toll roadtype basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,\nalleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don\'t know\nif people noticed it  the video, but there\'s no real limit\nto how many levels  tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep\nthan you can go up.  deepest mes are much deeper\nthan the tallest buildgs are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary\nlevel  urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important pot. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\nis that if you add one layer  tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,\nit will get used up,  then you\'ll be back where you started,\nback with congestion. But you can go to any\narbitrary number  tunnels, any number  levels. CA: But people  seen traditionally,\nit\'s credibly expensive to dig,  that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they\'re right. To give you an example,\nthe LA subway extension, which is  I thk it\'s\na twoahalf mile extension that was just completed\nfor two billion dollars. So it\'s roughly a billion dollars a mile\nto do the subway extension  LA. And this is not the highest\nutility subway  the world. So yeah, it\'s quite difficult\nto dig tunnels normally. I thk we need to have\nat least a tenfold improvement  the cost per mile  tunnelg. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two thgs, you can get to approximately\nan order  magnitude improvement,  I thk you can go beyond that. So the first thg to do\nis to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor  two or more. So a sgle road lane tunnel\naccordg to regulations has to be 26 feet,\nmaybe 28 feet  diameter to allow for crashes\n emergency vehicles  sufficient ventilation\nfor combustion enge cars. But if you shrk that diameter\nto what we\'re attemptg, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\nto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor  two  the crosssectional area\nby a factor  four,  the tunnelg cost scales\nwith the crosssectional area. So that\'s roughly a halforder\n magnitude improvement right there. n tunnelg maches currently tunnel\nfor half the time, then they stop,  then the rest  the time\nis puttg  reforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the mache stead to do contuous\ntunnelg  reforcg, that will give you\na factor  two improvement. Combe that  that\'s a factor  eight. so these maches are far from beg\nat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\nto the mache substantially. I thk you can get\nat least a factor  two, maybe a factor  four or five\nimprovement on top  that. So I thk there\'s a fairly\nstraightforward series  steps to get somewhere  excess\n an order  magnitude improvement  the cost per mile,  our target actually is  we\'ve got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\nfrom ""South Park,"" I mean, sorry, ""SpongeBob SquarePants."" () So Gary is capable   currently he\'s capable\n gog 1 times faster than a tunnelborg mache. () CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. () He\'s not a patient little fellow,  that will be victory. Victory is beatg the snail. CA: But a lot  people imagg,\ndreamg about future cities, they image that actually\nthe solution is flyg cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn\'t that a better solution? You save all that tunnelg cost. EM: Right. I\'m  favor  flyg thgs. Obviously, I do rockets,\nso I like thgs that fly. This is not some herent bias\nagast flyg thgs, but there is a challenge with flyg cars  that they\'ll be quite noisy, the wd force generated\nwill be very high. Let\'s just say that if somethg\'s\nflyg over your head, a whole bunch  flyg cars\ngog all over the place, that is not an anxietyreducg situation. () You don\'t thk to yourself,\n""Well, I feel better about today."" You\'re thkg,\n""Did they service their hubcap, or is it gog to come f\n guillote me?"" Thgs like that. CA: So you\'ve got this vision  future cities with these rich,\n3D networks  tunnels underneath. Is there a tie here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels\nto use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we\'ve been\nsort  putterg around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track\nadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage novative\nideas  transport. And it actually ends up beg\nthe biggest vacuum chamber  the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that,\nbut it was kd  a hobby thg,  then we thk we might  so we\'ve built a little pusher car\nto push the student pods, but we\'re gog to try seeg\nhow fast we can make the pusher go if it\'s not pushg somethg. So we\'re cautiously optimistic we\'ll be able to be faster\nthan the world\'s fastest bullet tra even  a .8mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it\'s  yeah. It\'s either gog to smash\nto ty pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,\nthen, a Hyperloop  a tunnel runng quite long distances. EM: Exactly. And lookg at tunnelg technology, it turns out that\n order to make a tunnel, you have to  In order to seal agast the water table, you\'ve got to typically design\na tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or nearvacuum. So actually, it sort  turns out\nthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough\nto resist the water table, it is automatically\ncapable  holdg vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture, what kd  length tunnel\nis  Elon\'s future to runng Hyperloop? EM: I thk there\'s no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I thk if you were to do somethg like a DCtoNew York Hyperloop, I thk you\'d probably want\nto go underground the entire way because it\'s a highdensity area. You\'re gog under\na lot  buildgs  houses,  if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people thk,\nwell, it\'s gog to be pretty annoyg to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four\ntunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able\nto detect it beg dug at all. In fact, if you\'re able\nto detect the tunnel beg dug, whatever device you are usg, you can get a lot  money\nfor that device from the Israeli military, who is tryg to detect\ntunnels from Hamas,  from the US Customs  Border patrol\nthat try  detect drug tunnels. So the reality is that earth is credibly good\nat absorbg vibrations,  once the tunnel depth\nis below a certa level, it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive\nseismic strument, you might be able to detect it. CA: So you\'ve started\na new company to do this called  Borg Company. Very nice. Very funny. () EM: What\'s funny about that? () CA: How much  your time is this? EM: It\'s maybe ... two or three percent. CA: You\'ve called it a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk\nhobby looks like. () EM: I mean, it really is, like  This is basically terns\n people dog it part time. We bought some secondh machery. It\'s kd  putterg along,\nbut it\'s makg good progress, so  CA: So an even bigger part  your time is beg spent on electrifyg\ncars  transport through Tesla. Is one  the motivations\nfor the tunnelg project the realization that actually,  a world where cars are electric\n where they\'re selfdrivg, there may end up beg\nmore cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot  people thk\nthat when you make cars autonomous, they\'ll be able to go faster\n that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy\nwhere it\'s much cheaper to go by car  you can go pot to pot, the affordability  gog  a car\nwill be better than that  a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount  drivg that will occur\nwill be much greater with shared autonomy,  actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Tesla\nwith the goal  persuadg the world that electrification\nwas the future  cars,  a few years ago,\npeople were laughg at you. Now, not so much. EM: OK. () I don\'t know. I don\'t know. CA: But isn\'t it true that pretty much\nevery auto manufacturer has announced\nserious electrification plans for the short to mediumterm future? EM: Yeah. Yeah. I thk almost every automaker\nhas some electric vehicle program. y vary  seriousness. Some are very serious\nabout transitiong entirely to electric,  some are just dabblg  it. And some, amazgly,\nare still pursug fuel cells, but I thk that won\'t last much longer. CA: But isn\'t there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory\n say, you know, ""We did it."" Let the world electrify,\n you go on  focus on other stuff? EM: Yeah. I tend to stay with Tesla\nas far to the future as I can image,  there are a lot  excitg\nthgs that we have comg. Obviously the Model 3 is comg soon. We\'ll be unveilg the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we\'re gog to come to this. So Model 3, it\'s supposed\nto be comg  Julyish. EM: Yeah, it\'s lookg quite good\nfor startg production  July. CA: Wow. One  the thgs\nthat people are so excited about is the fact that it\'s got autopilot. And you put out this video a while back showg what that technology\nwould look like. EM: Yeah. CA: re\'s obviously autopilot\n Model S right now. What are we seeg here? EM: Yeah, so this is usg\nonly cameras  GPS. So there\'s no LIDAR\nor radar beg used here. This is just usg passive optical,\nwhich is essentially what a person uses.  whole road system\nis meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras,  so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved. If you don\'t solve vision,\nit\'s not solved. So that\'s why our focus is\nso heavily on havg a vision neural net that\'s very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other people\nare gog the LIDAR route. You want cameras plus radar is most  it. EM: You can absolutely\nbe superhuman with just cameras. Like, you can probably do it\nten times better than humans would, just cameras. CA: So the new cars beg sold right now\nhave eight cameras  them. y can\'t yet do what that showed. When will they be able to? EM: I thk we\'re still on track\nfor beg able to go crosscountry from LA to New York by the end\n the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the end\n the year, you\'re sayg, someone\'s gog to sit  a Tesla\nwithout touchg the steerg wheel, tap  ""New York,"" f it goes. EM: Yeah. CA: Won\'t ever have to touch the wheel \nby the end  2017. EM: Yeah. Essentially,\nNovember or December  this year, we should be able to go all the way\nfrom a parkg lot  California to a parkg lot  New York, no controls touched at any pot\ndurg the entire journey. () CA: Amazg. But part  that is possible because you\'ve already got a fleet\n Teslas drivg all these roads. You\'re accumulatg a huge amount\n data  that national road system. EM: Yes, but the thg\nthat will be terestg is that I\'m actually fairly confident\nit will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically. So, it\'s fairly easy  If you say I\'m gog to be really good\nat one specific route, that\'s one thg, but it should be able to go,\nreally be very good, certaly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system  a given country. So it\'s not sort  limited\nto LA to New York. We could change it\n make it SeattleFlorida, that day,  real time. So you were gog from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto. CA: So leavg aside\nregulation for a second,  terms  the technology alone, the time when someone\nwill be able to buy one  your cars  literally just take the hs\nf the wheel  go to sleep  wake up  fd that they\'ve arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I thk that\'s about two years. So the real trick  it\nis not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent  the time, because, like, if a car crashes\none  a thous times, then you\'re probably still not gog\nto be comfortable fallg asleep. You shouldn\'t be, certaly. () It\'s never gog to be perfect. No system is gog to be perfect, but if you say it\'s perhaps  the car is unlikely to crash  a hundred lifetimes,\nor a thous lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow,\nif I were to live a thous lives, I would still most likely\nnever experience a crash, then that\'s probably OK. CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern  yours\nis that people may actually get seduced too early\nto thk that this is safe,  that you\'ll have some horrible\ncident happen that puts thgs back. EM: Well, I thk that the autonomy system\nis likely to at least mitigate the crash, except  rare circumstances.  thg to appreciate\nabout vehicle safety is this is probabilistic. I mean, there\'s some chance that any time\na human driver gets  a car, that they will have an accident\nthat is their fault. It\'s never zero. So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy\nneed to be than a person before you can rely on it? CA: But once you get\nliterally safe hsf drivg, the power to disrupt\nthe whole dustry seems massive, because at that pot you\'ve spoken\n people beg able to buy a car, drops you f at work,\n then you let it go  provide a sort  Uberlike\nservice to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost\n your lease  that car, so you can kd  get a car for free. Is that really likely? EM: Yeah. Absolutely\nthis is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car  you can choose\nto use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used\nonly by friends  family, only by other drivers\nwho are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes\nbut not other times. That\'s 100 percent what will occur. It\'s just a question  when. CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi  I thk you\'re planng\nto announce this  September, but I\'m curious whether there\'s\nanythg you could show us today? EM: I will show you\na teaser shot  the truck. () It\'s alive. CA: OK. EM: That\'s defitely a case\nwhere we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah. () CA: We can\'t see that much  it, but it doesn\'t look like\njust a little friendly neighborhood truck. It looks kd  badass. What sort  semi is this? EM: So this is a heavy duty,\nlongrange semitruck. So it\'s the highest weight capability  with long range. So essentially it\'s meant to alleviate\nthe heavyduty truckg loads. And this is somethg which\npeople do not today thk is possible. y thk the truck doesn\'t have enough\npower or it doesn\'t have enough range,  then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can outtorque any diesel semi. And if you had a tugwar competition, the Tesla Semi\nwill tug the diesel semi uphill. () () CA: That\'s pretty cool.\nAnd short term, these aren\'t driverless. se are gog to be trucks\nthat truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will be\nreally fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve\nwith an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kd\n ternal combustion enge car, you\'ve got a torque RPM curve\nthat looks like a hill. So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this\naround like a sports car. re\'s no gears.\nIt\'s, like, sgle speed. CA: re\'s a great movie\nto be made here somewhere. I don\'t know what it is\n I don\'t know that it ends well, but it\'s a great movie. () EM: It\'s quite bizarre testdrivg. When I was drivg the test prototype\nfor the first truck. It\'s really weird,\nbecause you\'re drivg around  you\'re just so nimble,\n you\'re  this giant truck. CA: Wait, you\'ve\nalready driven a prototype? EM: Yeah, I drove it\naround the parkg lot,  I was like, this is crazy. CA: Wow. This is no vaporware. EM: It\'s just like,\ndrivg this giant truck  makg these mad maneuvers. CA: This is cool.\nOK, from a really badass picture to a kd  less badass picture. This is just a cute house\nfrom ""Desperate Housewives"" or somethg. What on earth is gog on here? EM: Well, this illustrates\nthe picture  the future that I thk is how thgs will evolve. You\'ve got an electric car\n the driveway. If you look  between\nthe electric car  the house, there are actually three Powerwalls\nstacked up agast the side  the house,  then that house ro is a solar ro. So that\'s an actual solar glass ro. CA: OK. EM: That\'s a picture  a real \nwell, admittedly, it\'s a real fake house. That\'s a real fake house. () CA: So these ro tiles, some  them have  them\nbasically solar power, the ability to  EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust\nthe texture  the color to a very fegraed level,  then there\'s\nsort  microlouvers  the glass, such that when you\'re lookg\nat the ro from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell\nbehd it or not. So you have an even color from the ground level. If you were to look at it\nfrom a helicopter, you would be actually able\nto look through  see that some  the glass tiles have\na solar cell behd them  some do not. You can\'t tell from street level. CA: You put them  the ones\nthat are likely to see a lot  sun,  that makes these ros\nsuper affordable, right? y\'re not that much more expensive\nthan just tilg the ro. EM: Yeah. We\'re very confident\nthat the cost  the ro plus the cost  electricity  A solar glass ro will be less\nthan the cost  a normal ro plus the cost  electricity. So  other words, this will be economically a nobraer, we thk it will look great,  it will last  We thought about havg\nthe warranty be fity, but then people thought, well, that might sound\nlike were just talkg rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass. Well after the house has collapsed  there\'s nothg there, the glass tiles will still be there. () CA: I mean, this is cool. So you\'re rollg this out\n a couple week\'s time, I thk, with four different rog types. EM: Yeah, we\'re startg f\nwith two, two itially,  the second two\nwill be troduced early next year. CA: And what\'s the scale  ambition here? How many houses do you believe\ncould end up havg this type  rog? EM: I thk eventually almost all houses will have a solar ro.  thg is to consider\nthe time scale here to be probably on the order  0 or 50 years. So on average, a ro\nis replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don\'t start replacg\nall ros immediately. But eventually,\nif you say were to fastforward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a ro\nthat does not have solar. CA: Is there a mental model thg\nthat people don\'t get here that because  the shift  the cost,\nthe economics  solar power, most houses actually have\nenough sunlight on their ro pretty much to power all  their needs. If you could capture the power, it could pretty much\npower all their needs. You could go fgrid, kd . EM: It depends on where you are  what the house size is\nrelative to the ro area, but it\'s a fair statement to say that most houses  the US\nhave enough ro area to power all the needs  the house. CA: So the key to the economics  the cars, the Semi,  these houses is the fallg price\n lithiumion batteries, which you\'ve made a huge bet on as Tesla. In many ways, that\'s almost\nthe core competency. And you\'ve decided that to really, like, own that competency, you just have to build\nthe world\'s largest manufacturg plant to double the world\'s supply\n lithiumion batteries, with this guy. What is this? EM: Yeah, so that\'s the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory. Eventually, you can sort  roughly see that there\'s sort \na diamond shape overall,  when it\'s fully done,\nit\'ll look like a giant diamond, or that\'s the idea behd it,  it\'s aligned on true north. It\'s a small detail. CA: And capable  producg, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours\n batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\nWe thk probably more, but yeah. CA: And they\'re actually\nbeg produced right now. EM: y\'re  production already.\nCA: You guys put out this video. I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That\'s the slowed down version. () CA: How fast does it actually go? EM: Well, when it\'s runng at full speed, you can\'t actually see the cells\nwithout a strobe light. It\'s just blur. () CA: One  your core ideas, Elon,\nabout what makes an excitg future is a future where we no longer\nfeel guilty about energy. Help us picture this. How many Gigafactories, if you like,\ndoes it take to get us there? EM: It\'s about a hundred, roughly. It\'s not 10, it\'s not a thous. Most likely a hundred. CA: See, I fd this amazg. You can picture what it would take to move the world\nf this vast fossil fuel thg. It\'s like you\'re buildg one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars. Like, it\'s kd  cool\nthat you can picture that project. And you\'re planng to do, at Tesla \nannounce another two this year. EM: I thk we\'ll announce locations for somewhere between two\n four Gigafactories later this year. Yeah, probably four. CA: Whoa. () No more teasg from you for here? Like  where, content? You can say no. EM: We need to address a global market. CA: OK. () This is cool. I thk we should talk for  Actually, global market. I\'m gog to ask you one question\nabout politics, only one. I\'m kd  sick  politics,\nbut I do want to ask you this. You\'re on a body now\ngivg advice to a guy  EM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn\'t\nreally believe  climate change,  there\'s a lot  people out there\nwho thk you shouldn\'t be dog that. y\'d like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I thk that first  all, I\'m just on two advisory councils where the format consists\n gog around the room  askg people\'s opion on thgs,  so there\'s like a meetg\nevery month or two. That\'s the sum total  my contribution. But I thk to the degree\nthat there are people  the room who are argug  favor\n dog somethg about climate change, or social issues, I\'ve used the meetgs I\'ve had thus far to argue  favor  immigration\n  favor  climate change. () And if I hadn\'t done that, that wasn\'t on the agenda before. So maybe nothg will happen,\nbut at least the words were said. CA: OK. () So let\'s talk SpaceX  Mars. Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like\na kd  credibly ambitious dream to develop rockets\nthat were actually reusable. And you\'ve only gone  done it. EM: Fally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this.\nWhat are we lookg at here? EM: So this is one  our rocket boosters comg back from\nvery high  fast  space. So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity. I thk this might have been\nat sort  Mach 7 or so, delivery  the upper stage. () CA: So that was a spedup  EM: That was the slowed down version. () CA: I thought that was\nthe spedup version. But I mean, that\'s amazg,  several  these failed before you fally\nfigured out how to do it, but now you\'ve done this,\nwhat, five or six times? EM: We\'re at eight or ne. CA: And for the first time, you\'ve actually reflown\none  the rockets that led. EM: Yeah, so we led the rocket booster  then prepped it for flight aga\n flew it aga, so it\'s the first reflight\n an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant. So it\'s important to appreciate\nthat reusability is only relevant if it is rapid  complete. So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid  complete. You do not send your aircraft\nto Boeg between flights. CA: Right. So this is allowg you\nto dream  this really ambitious idea  sendg many, many, many people to Mars , what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you\'ve designed\nthis outrageous rocket to do it. Help us underst\nthe scale  this thg. EM: Well, visually\nyou can see that\'s a person. Yeah,  that\'s the vehicle. () CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that\'s like, did I read that,\na 0story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah.  thrust level  this is really  This configuration is about four times\nthe thrust  the Saturn V moon rocket. CA: Four times the thrust  the biggest\nrocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah. CA: As one does.\nEM: Yeah. () In units  77, a 77 is only about\na quarter  a million pounds  thrust, so for every 10 million pounds  thrust, there\'s 0 77s. So this would be the thrust equivalent\n 120 77s, with all enges blazg. CA: And so even with a mache\ndesigned to escape Earth\'s gravity, I thk you told me last time this thg could actually\ntake a fully loaded 77, people, cargo, everythg, to orbit. EM: Exactly. This can take\na fully loaded 77 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers,\nmaximum cargo on the 77  this can take it as cargo. CA: So based on this, you presented recently\nthis Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture , what,\n30 years time? 20 years time? People walkg to this rocket. EM: I\'m hopeful it\'s sort \nan eight to 10year time frame. Aspirationally, that\'s our target. Our ternal targets\nare more aggressive, but I thk  () CA: OK. EM: While vehicle seems quite large  is large by comparison\nwith other rockets, I thk the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat.  future spaceships\nwill be  enormous. CA: Why, Elon? Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people\non it  your lifetime, which I thk is kd \nwhat you\'ve said you\'d love to do? EM: I thk it\'s important to have a future that is spirg  appealg. I just thk there have to be reasons that you get up  the morng\n you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What\'s the pot? What spires you? What do you love about the future? And if we\'re not out there, if the future does not clude\nbeg out there among the stars  beg a multiplanet species, I fd that it\'s credibly depressg if that\'s not the future\nthat we\'re gog to have. () CA: People want to position this\nas an either or, that there are so many desperate thgs\nhappeng on the planet now from climate to poverty\nto, you know, you pick your issue. And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn\'t be thkg about this. You should be solvg what\'s here  now. And to be fair, you\'ve done\na fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustaable energy. But why not just do that? EM: I thk there\'s  I look at the future\nfrom the stpot  probabilities. It\'s like a branchg\nstream  probabilities,  there are actions that we can take\nthat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thg\nor slow down another thg. I may troduce somethg new\nto the probability stream. Sustaable energy\nwill happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla,\nif Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out  necessity. It\'s tautological. If you don\'t have sustaable energy,\nit means you have unsustaable energy. Eventually you will run out,  the laws  economics\nwill drive civilization towards sustaable energy, evitably.  fundamental value\n a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates\nthe advent  sustaable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I thk, like, what is the fundamental good\n a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,\npotentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thg to occur. That\'s what I consider to be the fundamental\naspirational good  Tesla. n there\'s becomg a multiplanet\nspecies  spacefarg civilization. This is not evitable. It\'s very important to appreciate\nthis is not evitable.  sustaable energy future\nI thk is largely evitable, but beg a spacefarg civilization\nis defitely not evitable. If you look at the progress  space,  1969 you were able\nto send somebody to the moon. 1969. n we had the Space Shuttle.  Space Shuttle could only\ntake people to low Earth orbit. n the Space Shuttle retired,  the United States\ncould take no one to orbit. So that\'s the trend.  trend is like down to nothg. People are mistaken when they thk that technology\njust automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot  people\nwork very hard to make it better,  actually it will, I thk,\nby itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations\nlike Ancient Egypt,  they were able to make the pyramids,  they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans,\nthey built these credible aqueducts. y forgot how to do it. CA: Elon, it almost seems,\nlisteng to you  lookg at the different\nthgs you\'ve done, that you\'ve got this unique\ndouble motivation on everythg that I fd so terestg. One is this desire to work\nfor humanity\'s longterm good.  other is the desire\nto do somethg excitg. And ten it feels like you feel\nlike you need the one to drive the other. With Tesla, you want\nto have sustaable energy, so you made these super sexy,\nexcitg cars to do it. Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful ros. We haven\'t even spoken\nabout your newest thg, which we don\'t have time to do, but you want to save humanity from bad AI,  so you\'re gog to create\nthis really cool bramache terface to give us all fite memory\n telepathy  so forth. And on Mars, it feels\nlike what you\'re sayg is, yeah, we need to save humanity  have a backup plan, but also we need to spire humanity,  this is a way to spire. EM: I thk the value\n beauty  spiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear. I\'m not tryg to be anyone\'s savior. That is not the  I\'m just tryg to thk about the future  not be sad. () CA: Beautiful statement. I thk everyone here would agree that it is not  None  this is gog\nto happen evitably.  fact that  your md,\nyou dream this stuff, you dream stuff that no one else\nwould dare dream, or no one else\nwould be capable  dreamg at the level  complexity that you do.  fact that you do that, Elon Musk,\nis a really remarkable thg. Thank you for helpg us all\nto dream a bit bigger. EM: But you\'ll tell me if it ever\nstarts gettg genuely sane, right? () CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.\nThat was really, really fantastic. That was really fantastic. ()"
126,0.0,"Strap yourselves , we\'re gog to Mars. Not just a few astronauts  thouss  people\nare gog to colonize Mars. And I am tellg you\nthat they\'re gog to do this soon. Some  you will end up\nworkg on projects on Mars,  I guarantee that some\n your children will end up livg there. That probably sounds preposterous, so I\'m gog to share with you\nhow  when that will happen. But first I want to discuss\nthe obvious question: Why the heck should we do this? 12 years ago, I gave a  talk on 10 ways\nthe world could end suddenly. We are credibly vulnerable\nto the whims  our own galaxy. A sgle, large asteroid\ncould take us out forever. To survive we have to reach\nbeyond the home planet.  what a tragedy it would be if all that humans have accomplished\nwere suddenly obliterated. And there\'s another reason we should go: exploration is  our DNA. Two million years ago\nhumans evolved  Africa  then slowly but surely\nspread out across the entire planet by reachg to the wilderness\nthat was beyond their horizons. This stuff is side us. And they prospered dog that. Some  the greatest advances\n civilization  technology came because we explored. Yes, we could do a lot  good with the money it will take\nto establish a thrivg colony on Mars. And yes we should all be takg\nfar better care  our own home planet. And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars\nthe way we\'ve screwed up Earth. But thk for a moment, what we had when John F. Kennedy\ntold us we would put a human on the moon. He excited an entire generation to dream.  how spired we will be\nto see a lg on Mars. Perhaps then we will look back at Earth  see that that is\none people stead  many  perhaps then\nwe will look back at Earth, as we struggle to survive on Mars,  realize how precious\nthe home planet is. So let me tell you about the extraordary\nadventure we\'re about to undertake. But first, a few fascatg facts\nabout where we\'re gog. This picture actually represents\nthe true size  Mars compared to Earth. Mars is not our sister planet. It\'s far less than half\nthe size  the Earth,  yet despite the fact\nthat it\'s smaller, the surface area  Mars\nthat you can st on is equivalent to the surface area\n the Earth that you can st on, because the Earth\nis mostly covered by water.  atmosphere on Mars is really th  100 times thner than on Earth   it\'s not breathable,\nit\'s 96 percent carbon dioxide. It\'s really cold there.  average temperature\nis mus 81 degrees, although there is\nquite a range  temperature. A day on Mars is about as long\nas a day on Earth, plus about 39 mutes. Seasons  years on Mars\nare twice as long as they are on Earth. And for anybody who wants to strap\non some wgs  go flyg one day, Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,  it\'s the kd  place where you can jump over your car\nstead  walk around it. Now, as you can see,\nMars isn\'t exactly Earthlike, but it\'s by far the most livable\nother place  our entire solar system. Here\'s the problem. Mars is a long way away, a thous times farther away\nfrom us than our own moon.  Moon is 250,000 miles away  it took Apollo astronauts\nthree days to get there. Mars is 250 million miles away  it will take us\neight months to get there  20 days. And that\'s only if we launch\non a very specific day, at a very specific time, once every two years, when Mars  the Earth\nare aligned just so, so the distance that the rocket\nwould have to travel will be the shortest. 20 days is a long time to spend\ntrapped with your colleagues  a t can. And meanwhile, our track record\n gettg to Mars is lousy. We  the Russians,\nthe Europeans, the Japanese, the Chese  the Indians, have actually sent  rockets there,  the vast majority  them\nhave either missed or crashed. Only about a third  the missions\nto Mars have been successful. And we don\'t at the moment have\na rocket big enough to get there anyway. We once had that rocket, the Saturn V. A couple  Saturn Vs\nwould have gotten us there. It was the most magnificent\nmache ever built by humans,  it was the rocket\nthat took us to the Moon. But the last Saturn V was used  1973\nto launch the lab space station,  we decided to do\nsomethg called the shuttle stead  contug on to Mars\nafter we led on the Moon.  biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough\nto get us anythg to Mars. So gettg to Mars is not gog to be easy  that brgs up\na really terestg question ... how soon will the first humans\nactually l here? Now, some pundits thk\nif we got there by 2050, that\'d be a pretty good achievement. se days,  seems to be sayg\nthat it can get humans to Mars by 200. Maybe they can. I believe that they can get\nhuman begs to Mars orbit by 2035. But frankly, I don\'t thk they\'re gog to bother\n 2035 to send a rocket to Mars, because we will already be there. We\'re gog to l on Mars  2027. And the reason is this man is determed\nto make that happen. His name is Elon Musk,\nhe\'s the CEO  Tesla Motors  SpaceX. Now, he actually told me\nthat we would l on Mars by 2025, but Elon Musk is more\noptimistic than I am   that\'s gog a ways  so I\'m givg him\na couple  years  slack. Still ... you\'ve got to ask yourself, can this guy really do this\nby 2025 or 2027? Well, let\'s put a decade with Elon Musk\nto a little perspective. Where was this 10 years ago? That\'s the Tesla electric automobile. In 2005, a lot  people\n the automobile dustry were sayg, we would not have\na decent electric car for 50 years. And where was that? That is SpaceX\'s Falcon 9 rocket, liftg six tons  supplies\nto the International Space Station. 10 years ago, SpaceX had not launched anythg,\nor fired a rocket to anywhere. So I thk it\'s a pretty good bet that the person who is revolutionizg\nthe automobile dustry  less than 10 years  the person who created an entire\nrocket company  less than 10 years will get us to Mars by 2027. Now, you need to know this: governments  robots\nno longer control this game. Private companies are leapg to space  they will be happy\nto take you to Mars. And that raises a really big question. Can we actually live there? Now,  may not be able\nto get us there until 200, or we may get there\na long time before , but  has taken a huge responsibility\n figurg out how we can live on Mars. Let\'s look at the problem this way. Here\'s what you need to live on Earth: food, water, shelter  clothg. And here\'s what you need to live on Mars: all  the above, plus oxygen. So let\'s look at the most\nimportant thg on this list first. Water is the basis\n all life as we know it,  it\'s far too heavy for us to carry\nwater from the Earth to Mars to live, so we have to fd water\nif our life is gog to succeed on Mars. And if you look at Mars,\nit looks really dry, it looks like the entire\nplanet is a desert. But it turns out that it\'s not.  soil alone on Mars\ncontas up to 60 percent water. And a number  orbiters that we still\nhave flyg around Mars have shown us   by the way,\nthat\'s a real photograph  that lots  craters on Mars\nhave a sheet  water ice  them. It\'s not a bad place to start a colony. Now, here\'s a view  a little dig\nthe Phoenix Ler did  2008, showg that just below\nthe surface  the soil is ice  that white stuff is ice. In the second picture, which is four days later\nthan the first picture, you can see that\nsome  it is evaporatg. Orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts\n underground water on Mars as well as glaciers. In fact, if only the water ice\nat the poles on Mars melted, most  the planet\nwould be under 30 feet  water. So there\'s plenty  water there, but most  it\'s ice,\nmost  it\'s underground, it takes a lot  energy to get it\n a lot  human labor. This is a device cooked up\nat the   Washgton back  1998. It\'s basically a lowtech dehumidifier. And it turns out the Mars atmosphere\nis ten 100 percent humid. So this device can extract\nall the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on Mars. Next we have to worry\nabout what we will breathe. Frankly, I was really shocked to fd out that \nhas this problem worked out. This is a scientist at MIT\nnamed Michael Hecht. And he\'s developed this mache, Moxie. I love this thg. It\'s a reverse fuel cell, essentially, that sucks  the Martian atmosphere\n pumps out oxygen. And you have to remember that CO2  carbon dioxide, which is\n96 percent  Mars\' atmosphere  CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen. Now, the next big rover\nthat  sends to Mars  2020 is gog to have one\n these devices aboard,  it will be able\nto produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive defitely. But the secret to this   that\'s just for testg  the secret to this is that this thg\nwas designed from the getgo to be scalable by a factor  100. Next, what will we eat? Well, we\'ll use hydroponics to grow food, but we\'re not gog to be able to grow more than 15 to 20 percent\n our food there, at least not until water is runng\non the surface  Mars  we actually have the probability\n the capability  plantg crops. In the meantime, most  our food will arrive from Earth,  it will be dried. And then we need some shelter. At first we can use flatable,\npressurized buildgs as well as the lers themselves. But this really only works\ndurg the daytime. re is too much solar radiation\n too much radiation from cosmic rays. So we really have to go underground. Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars, by  large,\nis perfect for makg bricks. And  has figured this one out, too. y\'re gog to throw\nsome polymer plastic to the bricks, shove them  a microwave oven,  then you will be able to build\nbuildgs with really thick walls. Or we may choose to live underground\n caves or  lava tubes,  which there are plenty. And fally there\'s clothg. On Earth we have miles\n atmosphere piled up on us, which creates 15 pounds  pressure\non our bodies at all times,  we\'re constantly\npushg out agast that. On Mars there\'s hardly\nany atmospheric pressure. So Dava Newman, a scientist at MIT, has created this sleek space suit. It will keep us together, block radiation  keep us warm. So let\'s thk about this for a mute. Food, shelter, clothg, water, oxygen ... we can do this. We really can. But it\'s still a little complicated\n a little difficult. So that leads to the next big  really big step   livg the good life on Mars. And that\'s terraformg the planet: makg it more like Earth, reengeerg an entire planet. That sounds like a lot  hubris, but the truth is that the technology to do everythg\nI\'m about to tell you already exists. First we\'ve got to warm it up. Mars is credibly cold\nbecause it has a very th atmosphere.  answer lies here, at the south pole\n at the north pole  Mars, both  which are covered with an credible amount\n frozen carbon dioxide  dry ice. If we heat it up, it sublimes directly to the atmosphere  thickens the atmosphere\nthe same way it does on Earth. And as we know, CO2 is an credibly\npotent greenhouse gas. Now, my favorite way  dog this\nis to erect a very, very large solar sail  focus it  it essentially serves as a mirror   focus it on the south pole\n Mars at first. As the planet sps, it will heat up\nall that dry ice, sublime it,  it will go to the atmosphere. It actually won\'t take long for the temperature\non Mars to start risg, probably less than 20 years. Right now, on a perfect day at the equator,  the middle  summer on Mars, temperatures can\nactually reach 70 degrees, but then they go down\nto mus 100 at night. () What we\'re shootg for\nis a runaway greenhouse effect: enough temperature rise\nto see a lot  that ice on Mars  especially the ice  the ground  melt. n we get some real magic. As the atmosphere gets thicker,\neverythg gets better. We get more protection from radiation, more atmosphere makes us warmer,\nmakes the planet warmer, so we get runng water  that makes crops possible. n more water vapor goes to the air,\nformg yet another potent greenhouse gas. It will ra  it will snow on Mars. And a thicker atmosphere\nwill create enough pressure so that we can\nthrow away those space suits. We only need about five pounds\n pressure to survive. Eventually, Mars will be made\nto feel a lot like British Columbia. We\'ll still be left\nwith the complicated problem  makg the atmosphere breathable,  frankly that could take\n1,000 years to accomplish. But humans are amazgly smart\n credibly adaptable. re is no tellg what our future\ntechnology will be able to accomplish  no tellg what we can do\nwith our own bodies. In biology right now, we are on the very verge  beg\nable to control our own genetics, what the genes\n our own bodies are dog,  certaly, eventually, our own evolution. We could end up with a species\n human beg on Earth that is slightly different\nfrom the species  human begs on Mars. But what would you do there?\nHow would you live? It\'s gog to be\nthe same as it is on Earth. Somebody\'s gog to start a restaurant, somebody\'s gog to build an iron foundry. Someone will make\ndocumentary movies  Mars  sell them on Earth. Some idiot will start a reality TV show. () re will be stware companies, there will be hotels, there will be bars. This much is certa: it will be the most disruptive\nevent  our lifetimes,  I thk it will be the most spirg. Ask any 10yearold girl\nif she wants to go to Mars. Children who are now  elementary school\nare gog to choose to live there. Remember when we led\nhumans on the Moon? When that happened,\npeople looked at each other  said, ""If we can do this, we can do anythg."" What are they gog to thk\nwhen we actually form a colony on Mars? Most importantly, it will make us a spacefarg species. And that means humans will survive\nno matter what happens on Earth. We will never be the last  our kd. Thank you. ()"
127,0.0,"Translator: Jenny Zurawell A few months ago the Nobel Prize  physics was awarded to two teams  astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one  the most important astronomical observations ever. And today, after briefly describg what they found, I\'m gog to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explag their discovery, namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth, the Milky Way  other distant galaxies, we may fd that our universe is not the only universe, but is stead part  a vast complex  universes that we call the multiverse. Now the idea  a multiverse is a strange one. I mean, most  us were raised to believe that the word ""universe"" means everythg. And I say most  us with forethought, as my fouryearold daughter has heard me speak  these ideas sce she was born. And last year I was holdg her  I said, ""Sophia, I love you more than anythg  the universe."" And she turned to me  said, ""Daddy, universe or multiverse?"" () But barrg such an anomalous upbrgg, it is strange to image other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes  their own. And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convce you that there\'s reason for takg it seriously, as it just might be right. I\'m gog to tell the story  the multiverse  three parts. In part one, I\'m gog to describe those Nobel Prizewng results  to highlight a pround mystery which those results revealed. In part two, I\'ll fer a solution to that mystery. It\'s based on an approach called strg theory,  that\'s where the idea  the multiverse will come to the story. Fally,  part three, I\'m gog to describe a cosmological theory called flation, which will pull all the pieces  the story together. Okay, part one starts back  1929 when the great astronomer Edw Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushg away from us, establishg that space itself is stretchg, it\'s expg. Now this was revolutionary.  prevailg wisdom was that on the largest  scales the universe was static. But even so, there was one thg that everyone was certa :  expansion must be slowg down. That, much as the gravitational pull  the Earth slows the ascent  an apple tossed upward, the gravitational pull  each galaxy on every other must be slowg the expansion  space. Now let\'s fastforward to the 1990s when those two teams  astronomers I mentioned at the outset were spired by this reasong to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowg. And they did this by pastakg observations  numerous distant galaxies, allowg them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time. Here\'s the surprise: y found that the expansion is not slowg down. Instead they found that it\'s speedg up, gog faster  faster. That\'s like tossg an apple upward  it goes up faster  faster. Now if you saw an apple do that, you\'d want to know why. What\'s pushg on it? Similarly, the astronomers\' results are surely welldeservg  the Nobel Prize, but they raised an analogous question. What force is drivg all galaxies to rush away from every other at an everquickeng speed? Well the most promisg answer comes from an old idea  Este\'s. You see, we are all used to gravity beg a force that does one thg, pulls objects together. But  Este\'s theory  gravity, his general theory  relativity, gravity can also push thgs apart. How? Well accordg to Este\'s math, if space is uniformly filled with an visible energy, sort  like a uniform, visible mist, then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive, repulsive gravity, which is just what we need to expla the observations. Because the repulsive gravity  an visible energy  space  we now call it dark energy, but I\'ve made it smokey white here so you can see it  its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push agast every other, drivg expansion to speed up, not slow down. And this explanation represents great progress. But I promised you a mystery here  part one. Here it is. When the astronomers worked out how much  this dark energy must be fusg space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found. This number is small. Expressed  the relevant unit, it is spectacularly small. And the mystery is to expla this peculiar number. We want this number to emerge from the laws  physics, but so far no one has found a way to do that. Now you might wonder, should you care? Maybe explag this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail  terest to experts, but  no relevance to anybody else. Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter. Some details provide wdows to uncharted realms  reality,  this peculiar number may be dog just that, as the only approach that\'s so far made headway to expla it vokes the possibility  other universes  an idea that naturally emerges from strg theory, which takes me to part two: strg theory. So hold the mystery  the dark energy  the back  your md as I now go on to tell you three key thgs about strg theory. First f, what is it? Well it\'s an approach to realize Este\'s dream  a unified theory  physics, a sgle overarchg framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work  the universe. And the central idea  strg theory is quite straightforward. It says that if you exame any piece  matter ever more fely, at first you\'ll fd molecules  then you\'ll fd atoms  subatomic particles. But the theory says that if you could probe smaller, much smaller than we can with existg technology, you\'d fd somethg else side these particles  a little ty vibratg filament  energy, a little ty vibratg strg. And just like the strgs on a viol, they can vibrate  different patterns producg different al notes. se little fundamental strgs, when they vibrate  different patterns, they produce different kds  particles  so electrons, quarks, neutros, photons, all other particles would be united to a sgle framework, as they would all arise from vibratg strgs. It\'s a compellg picture, a kd  cosmic symphony, where all the richness that we see  the world around us emerges from the  that these little, ty strgs can play. But there\'s a cost to this elegant unification, because years  research have shown that the math  strg theory doesn\'t quite work. It has ternal consistencies, unless we allow for somethg wholly unfamiliar  extra dimensions  space. That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions  space. And you can thk about those as height, width  depth. But strg theory says that, on fantastically small scales, there are additional dimensions crumpled to a ty size so small that we have not detected them. But even though the dimensions are hidden, they would have an impact on thgs that we can observe because the shape  the extra dimensions constras how the strgs can vibrate. And  strg theory, vibration determes everythg. So particle masses, the strengths  forces,  most importantly, the amount  dark energy would be determed by the shape  the extra dimensions. So if we knew the shape  the extra dimensions, we should be able to calculate these features, calculate the amount  dark energy.  challenge is we don\'t know the shape  the extra dimensions. l we have is a list  cidate shapes allowed by the math. Now when these ideas were first developed, there were only about five different cidate shapes, so you can image analyzg them onebyone to determe if any yield the physical features we observe. But over time the list grew as researchers found other cidate shapes. From five, the number grew to the hundreds  then the thouss  A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze, sce after all, graduate students need somethg to do. But then the list contued to grow to the millions  the billions, until today.  list  cidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500. So, what to do? Well some researchers lost heart, concludg that was so many cidate shapes for the extra dimensions, each givg rise to different physical features, strg theory would never make defitive, testable predictions. But others turned this issue on its head, takg us to the possibility  a multiverse. Here\'s the idea. Maybe each  these shapes is on an equal footg with every other. Each is as real as every other,  the sense that there are many universes, each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions. And this radical proposal has a pround impact on this mystery: the amount  dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prizewng results. Because you see, if there are other universes,  if those universes each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions, then the physical features  each universe will be different,   particular, the amount  dark energy  each universe will be different. Which means that the mystery  explag the amount  dark energy we\'ve now measured would take on a wholly different character. In this context, the laws  physics can\'t expla one number for the dark energy because there isn\'t just one number, there are many numbers. Which means we have been askg the wrong question. It\'s that the right question to ask is, why do we humans fd ourselves  a universe with a particular amount  dark energy we\'ve measured stead  any  the other possibilities that are out there? And that\'s a question on which we can make headway. Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours, whenever matter tries to clump to galaxies, the repulsive push  the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart  galaxies don\'t form. And  those universes that have much less dark energy, well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that, aga, galaxies don\'t form. And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets  no chance for our form  life to exist  those other universes. So we fd ourselves  a universe with the particular amount  dark energy we\'ve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form  life. And that would be that. Mystery solved, multiverse found. Now some fd this explanation unsatisfyg. We\'re used to physics givg us defitive explanations for the features we observe. But the pot is, if the feature you\'re observg can  does take on a wide variety  different values across the wider lscape  reality, then thkg one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided. An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understg a different number  why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth. And he worked for decades tryg to expla this number, but he never succeeded,  we know why. Kepler was askg the wrong question. We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety  different distances from their host stars. So hopg that the laws  physics will expla one particular number, 93 million miles, well that is simply wrongheaded. Instead the right question to ask is, why do we humans fd ourselves on a planet at this particular distance, stead  any  the other possibilities? And aga, that\'s a question we can answer. Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form  life wouldn\'t exist. And those planets that are much farther away from the star, well they\'re so cold that, aga, our form  life would not take hold. So we fd ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form  life. And when it comes to planets  their distances, this clearly is the right kd  reasong.  pot is, when it comes to universes  the dark energy that they conta, it may also be the right kd  reasong. One key difference,  course, is we know that there are other planets out there, but so far I\'ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes. So to pull it all together, we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes. And that takes me to my fal part, part three. Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists tryg to underst the  Bang. You see, when we speak  the  Bang, we ten have an image  a kd  cosmic explosion that created our universe  set space rushg outward. But there\'s a little secret.   Bang leaves out somethg pretty important, the Bang. It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no sight to what would have powered the Bang itself. And this gap was fally filled by an enhanced version  the  Bang theory. It\'s called flationary cosmology, which identified a particular kd  fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush  space.  fuel is based on somethg called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it\'s virtually impossible to use it all up, which means  the flationary theory, the  Bang givg rise to our universe is likely not a onetime event. Instead the fuel not only generated our  Bang, but it would also generate countless other  Bangs, each givg rise to its own separate universe with our universe becomg but one bubble  a gr cosmic bubble bath  universes. And now, when we meld this with strg theory, here\'s the picture we\'re led to. Each  these universes has extra dimensions.  extra dimensions take on a wide variety  different shapes.  different shapes yield different physical features. And we fd ourselves  one universe stead  another simply because it\'s only  our universe that the physical features, like the amount  dark energy, are right for our form  life to take hold. And this is the compellg but highly controversial picture  the wider cosmos that cuttgedge observation  theory have now led us to seriously consider. One big remag question,  course, is, could we ever confirm the existence  other universes? Well let me describe one way that might one day happen.  flationary theory already has strong observational support. Because the theory predicts that the  Bang would have been so tense that as space rapidly exped, ty quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world, yieldg a distctive fgerprt, a pattern  slightly hotter spots  slightly colder spots, across space, which powerful telescopes have now observed. Gog further, if there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so ten those universes can collide. And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern  temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect. And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded  observations, establishg the existence  other universes. I\'ll conclude with a strikg implication  all these ideas for the very far future. You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expg, that that expansion is speedg up  that there might be other universes all by carefully examg fat ppots  starlight comg to us from distant galaxies. But because the expansion is speedg up,  the very far future, those galaxies will rush away so far  so fast that we won\'t be able to see them  not because  technological limitations, but because  the laws  physics.  light those galaxies emit, even travelg at the fastest speed, the speed  light, will not be able to overcome the everwideng gulf between us. So astronomers  the far future lookg out to deep space will see nothg but an endless stretch  static, ky, black stillness. And they will conclude that the universe is static  unchangg  populated by a sgle central oasis  matter that they habit  a picture  the cosmos that we defitively know to be wrong. Now maybe those future astronomers will have records hed down from an earlier era, like ours, attestg to an expg cosmos teemg with galaxies. But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge? Or would they believe  the black, static empty universe that their own statetheart observations reveal? I suspect the latter. Which means that we are livg through a remarkably privileged era when certa deep truths about the cosmos are still with reach  the human spirit  exploration. It appears that it may not always be that way. Because today\'s astronomers, by turng powerful telescopes to the sky, have captured a hful  starkly formative photons  a kd  cosmic telegram billions  years  transit.  the message echog across the ages is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip  physical law. Sometimes the true nature  reality beckons from just beyond the horizon. Thank you very much. () Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you.  range  ideas you\'ve just spoken about are dizzyg, exhilaratg, credible. How do you thk  where cosmology is now,  a sort  historical side? Are we  the middle  somethg unusual historically  your opion? BG: Well it\'s hard to say. When we learn that astronomers  the far future may not have enough formation to figure thgs out, the natural question is, maybe we\'re already  that position  certa deep, critical features  the universe already have escaped our ability to underst because  how cosmology evolves. So from that perspective, maybe we will always be askg questions  never be able to fully answer them. On the other h, we now can underst how old the universe is. We can underst how to underst the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago   yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look  it matches. Holy cow! That\'s just amazg. So on the one h, it\'s just credible where we\'ve gotten, but who knows what sort  blocks we may fd  the future. CA: You\'re gog to be around for the next few days. Maybe some  these conversations can contue. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.) ()"
128,0.0,"What I\'d like to do today is talk\nabout one  my favorite subjects,  that is the neuroscience  sleep. Now, there is a sound  (arm clock) Ah, it worked! A sound that is desperately\nfamiliar to most  us,   course it\'s the sound\n the alarm clock. And what that  ghastly,\nawful sound does is stop the sgle most important\nbehavioral experience that we have,  that\'s sleep. If you\'re an average sort  person, 36 percent  your life\nwill be spent asleep, which means that if you live to 90, then 32 years will have\nbeen spent entirely asleep. Now what that 32 years is tellg us\nis that sleep at some level is important. And yet, for most  us,\nwe don\'t give sleep a second thought. We throw it away. We really just don\'t thk about sleep. And so what I\'d like to do today\nis change your views, change your ideas\n your thoughts about sleep. And the journey\nthat I want to take you on, we need to start by gog back  time. ""Enjoy the honeyheavy dew  slumber."" Any ideas who said that? Shakespeare\'s Julius Caesar. Yes, let me give you a few more quotes. ""O sleep, O gentle sleep,\nnature\'s st nurse, how have I frighted thee?"" Shakespeare aga, from \nI won\'t say it  the Scottish play. () From the same time: ""Sleep is the golden cha\nthat ties health  our bodies together."" Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,\nanother Elizabethan dramatist. But if we jump forward 00 years, the tone about sleep changes somewhat. This is from Thomas Edison,\nfrom the begng  the 20th century: ""Sleep is a crimal waste  time\n a heritage from our cave days."" Bang! () And if we also jump to the 1980s,\nsome  you may remember that Margaret Thatcher\nwas reported to have said, ""Sleep is for wimps."" And  course the famous \nwhat was his name?  the famous Gordon Gekko\nfrom "" "" said, ""Money never sleeps."" What do we do  the 20th\ncentury about sleep? Well,  course, we use\nThomas Edison\'s light bulb to vade the night,\n we occupied the dark,   the process  this occupation, we\'ve treated sleep as an illness, almost. We\'ve treated it as an enemy. At most now, I suppose,\nwe tolerate the need for sleep,  at worst perhaps\nmany  us thk  sleep as an illness that needs\nsome sort  a cure. And our ignorance about sleep\nis really quite pround. Why is it? Why do we abon\nsleep  our thoughts? Well, it\'s because you don\'t do anythg\nmuch while you\'re asleep, it seems. You don\'t eat. You don\'t drk. And you don\'t have sex. Well, most  us anyway. And so, therefore it\'s  Sorry. It\'s a complete waste  time, right? Wrong.

In fact, some areas  the bra\nare actually more active durg the sleep state\nthan durg the wake state.  other thg that\'s really\nimportant about sleep is that it doesn\'t arise from a sgle\nstructure with the bra, but is to some extent a network property. If we flip the bra on its back  I love this little bit\n spal cord here  this bit here is the hypothalamus,  right under there is a whole raft\n terestg structures, not least the biological clock.  biological clock tells us\nwhen it\'s good to be up, when it\'s good to be asleep,  what that structure does is teract with a whole raft  other areas\nwith the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus,\nthe ventrolateral preoptic nuclei. l  those combe,  they send projections\ndown to the bra stem here.  bra stem then projects forward  bathes the cortex,\nthis wonderfully wrkly bit over here, with neurotransmitters that keep us awake  essentially provide us\nwith our consciousness. So sleep arises from a whole raft  different teractions\nwith the bra,  essentially,\nsleep is turned on  f as a result  a range\n teractions  here. OK. So where have we got to? We\'ve said that sleep is complicated  it takes 32 years  our life. But what I haven\'t explaed\nis what sleep is about. So why do we sleep? And it won\'t surprise\nany  you that,  course, as scientists, we don\'t have a consensus. re are dozens  different ideas\nabout why we sleep,  I\'m gog to outle three  those.  first is sort  the restoration idea,  it\'s somewhat tuitive. Essentially, all the stuff\nwe\'ve burned up durg the day, we restore, we replace,\nwe rebuild durg the night. And deed, as an explanation,\nit goes back to Aristotle, so that\'s what  2,300 years ago. It\'s gone   out  fashion. It\'s fashionable at the moment because what\'s been shown\nis that with the bra, a whole raft  genes have been shown\nto be turned on only durg sleep,  those genes are associated\nwith restoration  metabolic pathways. So there\'s good evidence\nfor the whole restoration hypothesis. What about energy conservation? Aga, perhaps tuitive. You essentially sleep to save calories. Now, when you do the sums,\nthough, it doesn\'t really pan out. If you compare an dividual\nwho has slept at night, or stayed awake\n hasn\'t moved very much, the energy savg  sleepg\nis about 110 calories a night. Now, that\'s the equivalent\n a hot dog bun. Now, I would say that a hot dog bun is kd  a meager return for such a complicated\n demg behavior as sleep. So I\'m less convced\nby the energy conservation idea. But the third idea I\'m quite attracted to, which is bra processg\n memory consolidation. What we know is that,\nif after you\'ve tried to learn a task,  you sleepdeprive dividuals, the ability to learn that task is smashed. It\'s really hugely attenuated. So sleep  memory consolidation\nis also very important. However, it\'s not just\nthe layg down  memory  recallg it. What\'s turned out to be really excitg is that our ability to come up\nwith novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night  sleep. In fact, it\'s been estimated\nto give us a threefold advantage. Sleepg at night enhances our creativity. And what seems to be gog on\nis that,  the bra, those neural connections\nthat are important, those synaptic connections\nthat are important, are lked  strengthened, while those that are less important\ntend to fade away  be less important. OK. So we\'ve had three explanations\nfor why we might sleep,  I thk the important thg to realize\nis that the details will vary,  it\'s probable we sleep\nfor multiple different reasons. But sleep is not an dulgence. It\'s not some sort  thg that we can\ntake on board rather casually. I thk that sleep was once\nlikened to an upgrade from economy to busess class,\nyou know, the equivalent . It\'s not even an upgrade\nfrom economy to first class.  critical thg to realize is that\nif you don\'t sleep, you don\'t fly. Essentially, you never get there. And what\'s extraordary\nabout much  our society these days is that we are desperately sleepdeprived. So let\'s now look at sleep deprivation. Huge sectors  society\nare sleepdeprived,  let\'s look at our sleepometer. So  the 1950s, good data\nsuggests that most  us were gettg around eight hours\n sleep a night. Nowadays, we sleep one  a half\nto two hours less every night, so we\'re  the sixahalfhours\neverynight league. For teenagers, it\'s worse, much worse. y need ne hours\nfor full bra performance,  many  them, on a school night,\nare only gettg five hours  sleep. It\'s simply not enough. If we thk about other sectors\n society  the aged; if you are aged, then your ability\nto sleep  a sgle block is somewhat disrupted,\n many sleep, aga, less than five hours a night. Shift work. Shift work is extraordary, perhaps 20 percent\n the workg population,  the body clock does not shift\nto the dems  workg at night. It\'s locked onto the same\nlightdark cycle as the rest  us. So when the poor old\nshift worker is gog home to try  sleep durg the day,\ndesperately tired, the body clock is sayg,\n""Wake up. This is the time to be awake."" So the quality  sleep\nthat you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor,\naga  that sort  fivehour region. And then,  course, tens  millions\n people suffer from jet lag. So who here has jet lag? Well, my goodness gracious. Well, thank you very much\ndeed for not fallg asleep, because that\'s what your bra is cravg. One  the thgs that the bra does\nis dulge  microsleeps, this voluntary fallg asleep,  you have essentially\nno control over it. Now, microsleeps can be sort\n somewhat embarrassg, but they can also be deadly. It\'s been estimated\nthat 31 percent  drivers will fall asleep at the wheel\nat least once  their life,   the US, the statistics\nare pretty good: 100,000 accidents on the freeway\nhave been associated with tiredness, loss  vigilance,  fallg asleep \na hundred thous a year. It\'s extraordary. At another level  terror, we dip to the tragic\naccidents at Chernobyl  deed the space shuttle Challenger, which was so tragically lost. And  the vestigations\nthat followed those disasters, poor judgment as a result\n extended shift work  loss  vigilance  tiredness was attributed to a big chunk\n those disasters. When you\'re tired  you lack sleep, you have poor memory,\nyou have poor creativity, you have creased impulsiveness,  you have overall poor judgment. But my friends,\nit\'s so much worse than that. () If you are a tired bra, the bra is cravg thgs to wake it up. So drugs, stimulants. Caffee represents\nthe stimulant  choice across much  the Western world. Much  the day is fueled by caffee,  if you\'re a really naughty\ntired bra, nicote. Of course, you\'re fuelg the wakg state\nwith these stimulants,  then,  course, it gets\nto 11 o\'clock at night,  the bra says to itself, ""Actually, I need\nto be asleep fairly shortly. What do we do about that\nwhen I\'m feelg completely wired?"" Well,  course,\nyou then resort to alcohol. Now alcohol, shortterm,\nyou know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you,\ncan be very useful. It can actually ease the sleep transition. But what you must be so aware \nis that alcohol doesn\'t provide sleep. A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you. So it actually harms\nsome  the neural processg that\'s gog on durg memory\nconsolidation  memory recall. So it\'s a shortterm acute measure, but for goodness sake, don\'t become addicted to alcohol as a way  gettg to sleep every night. Another connection\nbetween loss  sleep is weight ga. If you sleep around\nabout five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percent\nlikelihood  beg obese. What\'s the connection here? Well, sleep loss seems to give rise\nto the release  the hormone ghrel, the hunger hormone. Ghrel is released. It gets to the bra.  bra says, ""I need carbohydrates,""  what it does is seek out carbohydrates\n particularly sugars. So there\'s a lk between tiredness  the metabolic predisposition\nfor weight ga: stress. Tired people are massively stressed. And one  the thgs  stress,\n course, is loss  memory, which is what I sort  just then\nhad a little lapse . But stress is so much more. So, if you\'re acutely stressed,\nnot a great problem, but it\'s sustaed stress associated\nwith sleep loss that\'s the problem. Sustaed stress leads\nto suppressed immunity. And so, tired people tend to have\nhigher rates  overall fection,  there\'s some very good studies showg that shift workers, for example,\nhave higher rates  cancer. Increased levels  stress\nthrow glucose to the circulation. Glucose becomes a domant part\n the vasculature  essentially you become\nglucose tolerant. refore, diabetes 2. Stress creases cardiovascular disease\nas a result  raisg blood pressure. So there\'s a whole raft  thgs\nassociated with sleep loss that are more than just\na mildly impaired bra, which is where I thk most people thk\nthat sleep loss resides. So at this pot  the talk,\nthis is a nice time to thk, ""Well, do you thk on the whole\nI\'m gettg enough sleep?"" So a quick show  hs. Who feels that they\'re gettg\nenough sleep here? Oh. Well, that\'s pretty impressive. Good. We\'ll talk more about that later,\nabout what are your tips. So most  us,  course,\nask the question, ""How do I know whether\nI\'m gettg enough sleep?"" Well, it\'s not rocket science. If you need an alarm clock to get\nyou out  bed  the morng, if you are takg a long time to get up, if you need lots  stimulants, if you\'re grumpy, if you\'re irritable, if you\'re told by your work colleagues\nthat you\'re lookg tired  irritable, chances are you are sleepdeprived. Listen to them. Listen to yourself. What do you do? Well   this is slightly fensive  sleep for dummies. () Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.  first critical thg is make it\nas dark as you possibly can,  also make it slightly cool. Very important. Actually, reduce your amount\n light exposure at least half an hour\nbefore you go to bed. Light creases levels  alertness\n will delay sleep. What\'s the last thg that most  us\ndo before we go to bed? We st  a massively lit bathroom, lookg to the mirror\ncleang our teeth. It\'s the worst thg we can possibly do\nbefore we go to sleep. Turn f those mobile phones.\nTurn f those computers. Turn f all  those thgs\nthat are also gog to excite the bra. Try not to drk caffee\ntoo late  the day, ideally not after lunch. Now, we\'ve set about reducg light\nexposure before you go to bed, but light exposure  the morng is very good at settg the biological\nclock to the lightdark cycle. So seek out morng light. Basically, listen to yourself. Wd down. Do those sorts  thgs that you know are gog to ease you f to the honeyheavy dew  slumber. OK. That\'s some facts. What about some myths? Teenagers are lazy. No. Poor thgs. y have a biological predisposition\nto go to bed late  get up late, so give them a break. We need eight hours  sleep a night. That\'s an average. Some people need more.\nSome people need less. And what you need to do\nis listen to your body. Do you need that much or do you need more? Simple as that. Old people need less sleep. Not true.  sleep dems  the aged\ndo not go down. Essentially, sleep fragments\n becomes less robust, but sleep requirements do not go down. And the fourth myth\nis early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy  wise. Well, that\'s wrong\nat so many different levels. () re is no evidence that gettg up early\n gog to bed early gives you more wealth at all. re\'s no difference\n socioeconomic status. In my experience, the only difference between morng\npeople  eveng people is that those people that get up\n the morng early are just horribly smug. () () OK. So for the last few mutes, what I want to do is change gears  talk about some really new,\nbreakg areas  neuroscience, which is the association\nbetween mental health, mental illness  sleep disruption. We\'ve known for 130 years\nthat  severe mental illness, there is always, always sleep disruption, but it\'s been largely ignored. In the 1970s, when people started\nto thk about this aga, they said, ""Yes, well,  course you have\nsleep disruption  schizophrenia, because they\'re on antipsychotics. It\'s the antipsychotics causg\nthe sleep problems,"" ignorg the fact that\nfor a hundred years previously, sleep disruption had been reported\nbefore antipsychotics. So what\'s gog on? Several groups are studyg conditions like depression,\nschizophrenia  bipolar  what\'s gog on\n terms  sleep disruption. We have a big study which we published\nlast year on schizophrenia,  the data were quite extraordary. In those dividuals with schizophrenia, much  the time, they were awake\ndurg the night phase  then they were asleep durg the day. Other groups showed no 2hour\npatterns whatsoever  their sleep was absolutely smashed. And some had no ability to regulate\ntheir sleep by the lightdark cycle. y were gettg up later  later\n later  later each night. It was smashed. So what\'s gog on? And the really excitg news is that mental illness  sleep\nare not simply associated, but they are physically lked\nwith the bra.  neural networks that predispose\nyou to normal sleep, give you normal sleep,  those that give you normal\nmental health, are overlappg. And what\'s the evidence for that? Well, genes that have been shown to be very important\n the generation  normal sleep, when mutated, when changed, also predispose dividuals\nto mental health problems. And last year, we published a study which showed that a gene\nthat\'s been lked to schizophrenia, when mutated, also smashes the sleep. So we have evidence\n a genue mechanistic overlap between these two important systems. Other work flowed from these studies.  first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certa types\n mental illness,  we\'ve shown that\n those young dividuals who are at high risk\n developg bipolar disorder, they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clical\ndiagnosis  bipolar.  other bit  data\nwas that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate, make worse,\nthe mental illness state. My colleague Dan Freeman\nhas used a range  agents which have stabilized sleep\n reduced levels  paranoia  those dividuals by 50 percent. So what have we got? We\'ve got,  these connections,\nsome really excitg thgs. In terms  the neuroscience, by understg these two systems, we\'re really begng to underst\nhow both sleep  mental illness are generated  regulated\nwith the bra.  second area\nis that if we can use sleep  sleep disruption\nas an early warng signal, then we have the chance  gog . If we know these dividuals\nare vulnerable, early tervention then becomes possible. And the third, which I thk\nis the most excitg, is that we can thk\n the sleep centers with the bra as a new therapeutic target. Stabilize sleep  those dividuals\nwho are vulnerable, we can certaly make them healthier, but also alleviate some  the appallg\nsymptoms  mental illness. So let me just fish. What I started by sayg is:\nTake sleep seriously. Our attitudes toward sleep\nare so very different from a predustrial age, when we were almost wrapped  a duvet. We used to underst tuitively\nthe importance  sleep. And this isn\'t some sort\n crystalwavg nonsense. This is a pragmatic response\nto good health. If you have good sleep,\nit creases your concentration, attention, decisionmakg,\ncreativity, social skills, health. If you get sleep, it reduces\nyour mood changes, your stress, your levels  anger, your impulsivity,  your tendency to drk  take drugs. And we fished by sayg that an understg\n the neuroscience  sleep is really formg the way we thk about some  the causes\n mental illness,  deed is providg us new ways to treat these credibly\ndebilitatg conditions. Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said, ""Sleep is God. Go worship."" And I can only recommend\nthat you do the same. Thank you for your attention. ()"
129,0.0,"So, I'm a climate scientist,  if this room is representative\n the country we live , that means about 60 percent  you,\nso maybe from about there over, don't strongly trust me for formation\non the causes  climate change. Now, I promise to tell the truth tonight, but just to humor that demographic, I've started this talk with a falsehood. [ Paris Climate Accord\nis a product  the recognition that climate change\nis a global problem ...] This statement was not made\nby President Obama. It was made by President Reagan,  it wasn't about climate change\n the Paris Climate Accord. It was actually\nabout the Montreal Protocol  stratospheric ozone depletion. Now, I'm sure that many  you aren't\nfamiliar with this environmental problem, but you should be, because it's a rare\nenvironmental success story. And it's worth revisitg, because sometimes, we need\nto exame the world we've avoided  order to fd guidance\nfor the choices we make today. So let's go back to the 1970s, when some questionable choices were made: first  all  hoo \nhairstyles. (Laughs) Second  all, objectively\nterrible quantities  hairspray,  third, CFCs, chlorluorocarbons, manmade chemicals that were used\nas propellant  aerosol spray cans. And see, it turns out\nthese CFCs were a problem because they were destroyg\nthe ozone layer. Now I'm sure most  you\nhave heard  the ozone layer, but why does it matter? Well, quite simply,\nthe ozone layer is earth's sunscreen,  it's really fragile. If you could take all  the ozone, which is mostly about\n10 to 20 miles up above our heads,  compress it down\nto the surface  the earth, it would form a th shell\nonly about two pennies thick, about an eighth  an ch. And that th shell does\nan amazg amount  work, though. It filters out more than 90 percent\n the harmful UV radiation comg from the sun. And while I'm sure many  you\nenjoy that suntan that you get from the remag 10 percent,\nit causes a lot  problems: cataracts, damage to crops, damage to immune systems  also sk cancer. It's not an exaggeration to say that a threat to the ozone layer\nis a threat to human safety. And actually, ironically,\nit was human safety that motivated the vention\n CFCs  the first place. You see,  the early days\n refrigeration, refrigerators used toxic\n flammable chemicals like propane  ammonia. For good reason,\nthe refrigeration dustry wanted a safe alternative,  they found that  1928, when a scientist named Thomas Midgley synthesized the first\ncommercially viable CFCs. And  fact, Midgley famously\nhaled CFCs  blew out a cle to demonstrate,\nat a scientific conference, that they were safe  nonflammable. And  fact, as a scientist,\nI can tell you there is no way you could get away\nwith that kd  antic today. I mean, wow. But really, at the time, CFCs were a really remarkable vention. y allowed what we now know\nas modernday refrigeration  airconditiong  other thgs. So it wasn't actually until\nover 0 years later,  the 1970s, when scientists realized that CFCs\nwould break down high  the atmosphere  damage the ozone layer. And this fdg really set f\na lot  public concern. It led, ultimately, to the banng\n CFC usage  aerosol spray cans  the US  a few\nother countries  1978. Now, the story doesn't end there, because CFCs were used\n much more than just spray cans. In 1985, scientists discovered\nthe Antarctic ozone hole,  this was a  alarmg discovery. Scientists did not expect this at all. Before the Antarctic ozone hole, scientists expected\nmaybe a five or 10 percent reduction  ozone over a century. But what they found\nover the course  less than a decade was that more than a third  the ozone\nhad simply vanished, over an area larger\nthan the size  the US. And although we now know that CFCs\nare the root cause  this ozone hole, at the time, the science\nwas far from settled. Yet despite this uncertaty, the crisis helped spur nations to act. So that quote that I started\nthis talk with, about the Montreal Protocol,\nfrom President Reagan  that was his signg statement\nwhen he signed the Montreal Protocol after its unanimous ratification\nby the US Senate. And this is somethg\nthat's  worth celebratg. In fact, yesterday was the 30th\nanniversary  the Montreal Protocol. () Because  the protocol, ozonedepletg substances\nare now declg  our atmosphere,  we're startg to see the first signs\n healg  the ozone layer. And furthermore, because many\n those ozonedepletg substances are also very potent greenhouse gases, the Montreal Protocol\nhas actually delayed global warmg by more than a decade. That's just wonderful. But I thk it's worth\naskg the question, as we face our current\nenvironmental crisis, global warmg, what lessons can we learn from Montreal? Are there any? I thk there are. First, we don't need\nabsolute certaty to act. When Montreal was signed, we were less certa then\n the risks from CFCs than we are now  the risks\nfrom greenhouse gas emissions. A common tactic that people\nwho oppose climate action use is to completely ignore risk\n focus only on uncertaty. But so what about uncertaty? We make decisions  the face\n uncertaty all the time, literally all the time. You know, I'll bet those  you\nwho drove here tonight, you probably wore your seat belt. And so ask yourself, did you wear your seat belt\nbecause someone told you with a hundred percent [certaty] that you would get\n a car crash on the way here? Probably not. So that's the first lesson. Risk management  decision makg\nalways have uncertaty. Ignorg risk  focusg\nonly on uncertaty is a distraction. In other words, action is an action. Second, it takes a village\nto raise a healthy environment.  Montreal Protocol wasn't just\nput together by dustry  governments or environmental advocacy\ngroups  scientists. It was put together by all  them. y all had a seat at the table,  they all played\nan important role  the solution. And I thk  this regard, we're actually seeg\nsome encouragg signs today. We see not just environmental groups\nconcerned about climate change but also civic  religious groups, the military  busesses. So wherever you fd yourself\non that spectrum, we need you at the table, because if we're gog\nto solve global warmg, it's gog to take actions at all levels, from the dividual to the ternational  everythg  between. Third lesson: don't let the perfect\nbe the enemy  the good. While Montreal has become the brake pedal\nfor stoppg ozone depletion, at its begng, it was more\njust like a tap on the brakes. It was actually the later\namendments to the protocol that really marked the decision\nto hit the brakes on ozone depletion. So to those who despair that the Paris Climate Accord\ndidn't go far enough or that your limited actions on their own\nwon't solve global warmg, I say don't let the perfect\nbe the enemy  the good. And fally, I thk it helps us\nto contemplate the world we've avoided. Indeed, the world we have avoided\nby enactg the Montreal Protocol is one  catastrophic changes to our environment\n to human wellbeg. By the 2030s, we'll be avoidg millions\n new sk cancer cases per year with a number that would only grow. If I'm lucky, I'll live long enough\nto see the end  this animation  to see the ozone hole\nrestored to its natural state. So as we write the story\nfor earth's climate future for this century  beyond, we need to ask ourselves,\nwhat will our actions be so that someone can st on this stage  30 or 50 or a hundred years to celebrate the world\nthat they've avoided. Thank you. ()"
130,0.0,"What an trigug\ngroup  dividuals you are ... to a psychologist. () I\'ve had the opportunity\nover the last couple  days  listeng  on some\n your conversations  watchg you teract with each other. And I thk it\'s fair to say, already, that there are 7 people  this audience, at this moment, displayg psychological symptoms\nI would like to discuss today. () And I thought you might\nlike to know who you are. () But stead  potg at you, which would be gratuitous  trusive, I thought I would tell you\na few facts  stories,  which you may catch\na glimpse  yourself. I\'m  the field  research\nknown as personality psychology, which is part  a larger\npersonality science which spans the full spectrum,\nfrom neurons to narratives. And what we try to do,  our own way, is to make sense  how each  us  each  you  is,  certa respects, like all other people, like some other people  like no other person. Now, already you may\nbe sayg  yourself, ""I\'m not trigug. I am the 6th most borg person\n the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say  yourself, ""I am trigug, even if I am regarded by most people\nas a great, thunderg twit."" () But it is your selfdiagnosed borgness\n your herent ""twitess"" that makes me, as a psychologist,\nreally fascated by you. So let me expla why this is so. One  the most fluential approaches\n personality science is known as trait psychology,  it aligns you along five dimensions\nwhich are normally distributed,  that describe universally held aspects\n difference between people. y spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" sts for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" sts for ""conscientiousness,""  contrast to those with a more\nlackadaisical approach to life. ""E""  ""extroversion,""  contrast\nto more troverted people. ""A""  ""agreeable dividuals,""  contrast to those\ndecidedly not agreeable. And ""N""  ""neurotic dividuals,""  contrast to those who are more stable. l  these dimensions have\nimplications for our wellbeg, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness  conscientiousness\nare very good predictors  life success, but the open people achieve that success\nthrough beg audacious , occasionally, odd.  conscientious people\nachieve it through stickg to deadles, to perseverg, as well as\nhavg some passion. Extroversion  agreeableness\nare both conducive to workg well with people. Extroverts, for example,\nI fd trigug. With my classes, I sometimes\ngive them a basic fact that might be revealg\nwith respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually\nimpossible for adults to lick the outside  their own elbow. () Did you know that? ready, some  you have tried\nto lick the outside  your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those\nwho have not only tried, but they have successfully\nlicked the elbow  the person sittg next to them. () Those are the extroverts. Let me deal  a bit more detail\nwith extroversion, because it\'s consequential\n it\'s trigug,  it helps us underst\nwhat I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature \nour neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural\n social aspects  our lives. And third, what makes you\ndividually you  idiosyncratic  what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me expla. One  the thgs that characterizes\nextroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved\nby fdg thgs that are excitg: loud noises, parties\n social events here at   you see the extroverts\nformg a magnetic core. y all gather together. And I\'ve seen you.  troverts are more likely\nto spend time  the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able\nto reduce stimulation   may be misconstrued\nas beg antisocial, but you\'re not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize\nthat you do better when you have a chance\nto lower that level  stimulation. Sometimes it\'s an ternal\nstimulant, from your body. Caffee, for example, works much better\nwith extroverts than it does troverts. When extroverts come to the fice\nat ne o\'clock  the morng  say, ""I really need a cup  cfee,"" they\'re not kiddg  they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks\nthey\'re engaged    they\'ve had some cfee  if those tasks are speeded,  if they\'re quantitative, troverts may give the appearance\n not beg particularly quantitative. But it\'s a misconstrual. So here are the consequences\nthat are really quite trigug: we\'re not always what seem to be,  that takes me to my next pot. I should say, before gettg to this, somethg about sexual tercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to  yes, you would? OK. () re are studies done on the frequency with which\ndividuals engage  the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female;\ntrovert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per mute  oh, I\'m sorry, that was a rat study  () How many times per month do troverted men engage  the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5  almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speakg as an troverted male, which I will expla later  they are heroic. 7.5. y not only hle\nall the male extroverts, they pick up a few troverts as well. () () We communicate differently,\nextroverts  troverts. Extroverts, when they teract, want to have lots  social encounter\npunctuated by closeness. y\'d like to st close\nfor comfortable communication. y like to have a lot  eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found  some research that they use more dimutive terms\nwhen they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,""\n then ""Chuck,""  then ""Chuckles Baby."" () Whereas for troverts, it remas ""Charles,"" until he\'s given\na pass to be more timate by the person he\'s talkg to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer blackwhite,\nconcrete, simple language. Introverts prefer \n I must aga tell you that I am as extreme an trovert\nas you could possibly image  we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contgent, weaselword sentences  () More or less. () As it were. () Not to put too fe a pot upon it  like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consultg contract\nI shared with a colleague who\'s as different from me\nas two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Me isn\'t. () Secondly, he\'s six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. () And thirdly, he\'s as extroverted\na person as you could fd. I am seriously troverted. I overload so much, I can\'t even have a cup  cfee\nafter three  the afternoon  expect to sleep  the eveng. We had seconded to this project\na fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought\nthe project to a crashg halt. So the person who seconded him\nasked Tom  me, ""What do you make  Michael?"" Well, I\'ll tell you\nwhat Tom said  a mute. He spoke  classic ""extrovertese."" And here is how extroverted ears\nheard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have\na tendency at times  behavg  a way\nthat some  us might see as perhaps more assertive\nthan is normally called for."" () Tom rolled his eyes  he said, ""Brian, that\'s what I said: he\'s an asshole!"" () () Now, as an trovert, I might gently allude to certa\n""assholic"" qualities  this man\'s behavior, but I\'m not gog to lunge for the aword. () But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks\nlike one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this somethg\nthat we should be heedful ? Of course. It\'s important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch  traits? No, we\'re not. Remember, you\'re like some other people  like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as rge, you may share your extroversion\nor your neuroticism. But are there some distctively\nElizabethan features  your behavior, or rgian  yours, that make us underst you\nbetter than just a bunch  traits? That make us love you? Not just because you\'re\na certa type  person. I\'m uncomfortable puttg\npeople  pigeonholes. I don\'t even thk pigeons\nbelong  pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It\'s the dogs that we have\n our life  the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid  you\'ve been back three times\nto the hospital,  they still don\'t know what\'s wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you\'d been actg out  character. se are free traits. You\'re very agreeable,\nbut you act disagreeably  order to break down those barriers\n admistrative torpor  the hospital, to get somethg\nfor your mom or your child. What are these free traits? y\'re where we enact a script  order to advance\na core project  our lives. And they are what matters. Don\'t ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core\nprojects  your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I\'m an trovert, but I have a core project,\nwhich is to press. I\'m a pressor. And I adore my students,  I adore my field. And I can\'t wait to tell them\nabout what\'s new, what\'s excitg, what I can\'t wait to tell them about. And so I act  an extroverted way, because at eight  the morng, the students need a little bit  humor, a little bit  engagement\nto keep them gog  arduous days  study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out  character. Sometimes we may fd\nthat we don\'t take care  ourselves. I fd, for example, after a period\n pseudoextroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Ca said  her ""Quiet"" book,  a chapter that featured\nthe strange Canadian pressor who was teachg at the time at , I sometimes go to the men\'s room to escape the slgs  arrows\n outrageous extroverts. () I remember one particular day\nwhen I was retired to a cubicle, tryg to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came\n beside me  not right  my cubicle, but  the next cubicle over   I could hear various\nevacuatory noises, which we hate  even our own, that\'s why we flush\ndurg as well as after. () And then I heard\nthis gravelly voice sayg, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" () If anythg is guaranteed\nto constipate an trovert for six months, it\'s talkg on the john. () That\'s where I\'m gog now. Don\'t follow me. Thank you. ()"
131,0.0,"So, I\'ll start with this: a couple\nyears ago, an event planner called me because I was gog\nto do a speakg event. And she called,  she said, ""I\'m really strugglg with how\nto write about you on the little flyer."" And I thought,\n""Well, what\'s the struggle?"" And she said, ""Well, I saw you speak,  I\'m gog to call you\na researcher, I thk, but I\'m afraid if I call you\na researcher, no one will come, because they\'ll thk\nyou\'re borg  irrelevant."" () And I was like, ""Okay."" And she said, ""But the thg\nI liked about your talk is you\'re a storyteller. So I thk what I\'ll do\nis just call you a storyteller."" And  course, the academic,\nsecure part  me was like, ""You\'re gog\nto call me a what?"" And she said, ""I\'m gog\nto call you a storyteller."" And I was like, ""Why not \'magic pixie\'?"" () I was like, ""Let me thk\nabout this for a second."" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know,\nI am a storyteller. I\'m a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that\'s what I do. And maybe stories\nare just data with a soul. And maybe I\'m just a storyteller. And so I said, ""You know what? Why don\'t you just say\nI\'m a researcherstoryteller."" And she went, ""Ha ha.\nre\'s no such thg."" () So I\'m a researcherstoryteller,\n I\'m gog to talk to you today  we\'re talkg about\nexpg perception   so I want to talk to you\n tell some stories about a piece  my research\nthat fundamentally exped my perception  really actually changed\nthe way that I live  love  work  parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher,\ndoctoral student, my first year, I had\na research pressor who said to us, ""Here\'s the thg, if you cannot\nmeasure it, it does not exist."" And I thought he was just\nsweettalkg me. I was like, ""Really?""\n he was like, ""Absolutely."" And so you have to underst that I have a bachelor\'s\n a master\'s  social work,  I was gettg my Ph.D.  social work,\nso my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kd \nbelieved  the ""life\'s messy, love it."" And I\'m more  the, ""life\'s messy,\nclean it up, organize it  put it to a bento box."" () And so to thk that I had found my way,\nto found a career that takes me  really, one  the big saygs\n social work is, ""Lean to the discomfort  the work."" And I\'m like, knock discomfort\nupside the head  move it over  get all A\'s. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what,\nthis is the career for me, because I am terested\n some messy topics. But I want to be able\nto make them not messy. I want to underst them. I want to hack to these thgs\nthat I know are important  lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time\nyou\'re a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection\nis why we\'re here. It\'s what gives purpose\n meang to our lives. This is what it\'s all about. It doesn\'t matter whether\nyou talk to people who work  social justice,\nmental health  abuse  neglect, what we know is that connection,\nthe ability to feel connected, is  neurobiologically\nthat\'s how we\'re wired  it\'s why we\'re here. So I thought, you know what,\nI\'m gog to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation\nfrom your boss,  she tells you 37 thgs\nthat you do really awesome,  one ""opportunity for growth?"" () And all you can thk about\nis that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way\nmy work went as well, because, when you ask people about love,\nthey tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belongg, they\'ll tell you their most excruciatg\nexperiences  beg excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me\nwere about disconnection. So very quickly  really about six weeks\nto this research  I ran to this unnamed thg\nthat absolutely unraveled connection  a way that I didn\'t underst\nor had never seen. And so I pulled back out  the research  thought, I need\nto figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood\nas the fear  disconnection: Is there somethg about me that,\nif other people know it or see it, that I won\'t be worthy  connection?  thgs I can tell you about it: It\'s universal; we all have it.  only people who don\'t experience shame have no capacity for human\nempathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it,  the less you talk about it,\nthe more you have it. What underpned this shame,\nthis ""I\'m not good enough,""  which, we all know that feelg: ""I\'m not blank enough.\nI\'m not th enough, rich enough, beautiful enough,\nsmart enough, promoted enough.""  thg that underpned this\nwas excruciatg vulnerability. This idea ,  order\nfor connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves\nto be seen, really seen. And you know how I feel\nabout vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance\nto beat it back with my measurg stick. I\'m gog , I\'m gog\nto figure this stuff out, I\'m gog to spend a year,\nI\'m gog to totally deconstruct shame, I\'m gog to underst\nhow vulnerability works,  I\'m gog to outsmart it. So I was ready,  I was really excited. As you know,\nit\'s not gog to turn out well. () You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I\'d have to borrow\neveryone else\'s time. But here\'s what I can tell you\nthat it boils down to   this may be one  the most important\nthgs that I\'ve ever learned  the decade  dog this research. My one year turned to six years: Thouss  stories, hundreds\n long terviews, focus groups. At one pot, people were\nsendg me journal pages  sendg me their stories  thouss  pieces  data  six years. And I kd  got a hle on it. I kd  understood, this is\nwhat shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory,\nbut somethg was not okay   what it was is that, if I roughly\ntook the people I terviewed  divided them to people who really\nhave a sense  worthess  that\'s what this comes down to,\na sense  worthess  they have a strong sense\n love  belongg   folks who struggle for it,  folks who are always wonderg\nif they\'re good enough. re was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense\n love  belongg  the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have\na strong sense  love  belongg believe they\'re worthy\n love  belongg. That\'s it. y believe they\'re worthy. And to me, the hard part  the one thg\nthat keeps us out  connection is our fear that we\'re not\nworthy  connection, was somethg that,\npersonally  pressionally, I felt like I needed to underst better. So what I did is I took\nall  the terviews where I saw worthess,\nwhere I saw people livg that way,  just looked at those. What do these people have  common? I have a slight fice supply addiction,\nbut that\'s another talk. So I had a manila folder,\n I had a Sharpie,  I was like, what am I gog\nto call this research? And the first words that came\nto my md were ""wholehearted."" se are wholehearted people,\nlivg from this deep sense  worthess. So I wrote at the top\n the manila folder,  I started lookg at the data. In fact, I did it first  a fourday,\nvery tensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the terviews,\nthe stories, pulled the cidents. What\'s the theme? What\'s the pattern? My husb left town with the kids because I always go to this\nJackson Pollock crazy thg, where I\'m just writg\n  my researcher mode. And so here\'s what I found. What they had  common\nwas a sense  courage. And I want to separate courage\n bravery for you for a mute. Courage, the origal\ndefition  courage, when it first came\nto the English language  it\'s from the Lat word ""cor,""\nmeang ""heart""   the origal defition was to tell\nthe story  who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply,\nthe courage to be imperfect. y had the compassion to be kd\nto themselves first  then to others, because, as it turns out, we can\'t practice compassion\nwith other people if we can\'t treat ourselves kdly. And the last was they had connection,\n  this was the hard part  as a result  authenticity, they were willg to let go\n who they thought they should be  order to be who they were,\nwhich you have to absolutely do that for connection.  other thg that they had\n common was this: y fully embraced vulnerability. y believed that what made them\nvulnerable made them beautiful. y didn\'t talk about vulnerability\nbeg comfortable, nor did they really talk\nabout it beg excruciatg  as I had heard it earlier\n the shame terviewg. y just talked about it beg necessary. y talked about the willgness\nto say, ""I love you"" first ... the willgness to do somethg\nwhere there are no guarantees ... the willgness to breathe\nthrough waitg for the doctor to call after your mammogram. y\'re willg to vest\n a relationship that may or may not work out. y thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged\nallegiance to research, where our job  you know, the defition  research\nis to control  predict, to study phenomena for the explicit\nreason to control  predict. And now my mission to control  predict had turned up the answer\nthat the way to live is with vulnerability  to stop controllg  predictg. This led to a little breakdown  ()  which actually looked more like this. () And it did. I call it a breakdown; my therapist\ncalls it a spiritual awakeng. () A spiritual awakeng\nsounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away\n go fd a therapist. Let me tell you somethg:\nyou know who you are when you call your friends  say,\n""I thk I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?"" Because about five\n my friends were like, ""Wooo, I wouldn\'t want\nto be your therapist."" () I was like, ""What does that mean?"" And they\'re like,\n""I\'m just sayg, you know. Don\'t brg your measurg stick."" () I was like, ""Okay."" So I found a therapist. My first meetg with her, Diana  I brought  my list  the way\nthe wholehearted live,  I sat down. And she said, ""How are you?"" And I said, ""I\'m great. I\'m okay."" She said, ""What\'s gog on?"" And this is a therapist\nwho sees therapists, because we have to go to those,\nbecause their B.S. meters are good. () And so I said, ""Here\'s the thg,\nI\'m strugglg."" And she said, ""What\'s the struggle?"" And I said, ""Well, I have\na vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability\nis the core  shame  fear  our struggle for worthess, but it appears that it\'s also\nthe birthplace  joy,  creativity,  belongg,  love. And I thk I have a problem,\n I need some help."" And I said, ""But here\'s the thg:\nno family stuff, no childhood shit."" () ""I just need some strategies."" () () Thank you. So she goes like this. () And then I said, ""It\'s bad, right?"" And she said, ""It\'s neither good nor bad."" () ""It just is what it is."" And I said, ""Oh my God,\nthis is gog to suck."" () And it did,  it didn\'t. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability\n tenderness are important, that they surrender  walk to it. A: that\'s not me,  B: I don\'t even hang out\nwith people like that. () For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back. And so then I went back to the research  spent the next couple  years really tryg to underst\nwhat they, the wholehearted, what choices they were makg,\n what we are dog with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone  strugglg\nwith vulnerability? No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability  when we\'re waitg for the call. It was funny, I sent somethg out\non Twitter  on Facebook that says, ""How would you\ndefe vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?"" And with an hour  a half,\nI had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what\'s out there. Havg to ask my husb for help\nbecause I\'m sick,  we\'re newly married; itiatg sex with my husb; itiatg sex with my wife; beg turned down; askg someone out; waitg for the doctor to call back; gettg laid f; layg f people. This is the world we live . We live  a vulnerable world. And one  the ways we deal\nwith it is we numb vulnerability. And I thk there\'s evidence   it\'s not the only reason\nthis evidence exists, but I thk it\'s a huge cause  We are the most debt ... obese ... addicted  medicated\nadult cohort  U.S. history.  problem is   I learned this\nfrom the research  that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can\'t say, here\'s the bad stuff. Here\'s vulnerability,\nhere\'s grief, here\'s shame, here\'s fear, here\'s disappotment. I don\'t want to feel these. I\'m gog to have a couple  beers\n a banana nut muff. () I don\'t want to feel these. And I know that\'s knowg . I hack to your lives for a livg. God. () You can\'t numb those hard feelgs without numbg\nthe other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happess. And then, we are miserable,  we are lookg\nfor purpose  meang,  then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple  beers\n a banana nut muff. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One  the thgs that I thk\nwe need to thk about is why  how we numb. And it doesn\'t just have to be addiction.  other thg we do is we make\neverythg that\'s uncerta certa. Religion has gone from a belief\n faith  mystery to certaty. ""I\'m right, you\'re wrong. Shut up."" That\'s it. Just certa.  more afraid we are,\nthe more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. re\'s no discourse anymore. re\'s no conversation. re\'s just blame. You know how blame\nis described  the research? A way to discharge pa  discomfort. We perfect. If there\'s anyone who wants their life\nto look like this, it would be me, but it doesn\'t work. Because what we do is we take fat\nfrom our butts  put it  our cheeks. () Which just, I hope  100 years,\npeople will look back  go, ""Wow."" () And we perfect,\nmost dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we thk\nabout children. y\'re hardwired for struggle\nwhen they get here. And when you hold those perfect\nlittle babies  your h, our job is not to say,\n""Look at her, she\'s perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect  make sure she makes the tennis team\nby fifth grade  Yale by seventh."" That\'s not our job. Our job is to look  say, ""You know what? You\'re imperfect,\n you\'re wired for struggle, but you are worthy  love  belongg."" That\'s our job. Show me a generation\n kids raised like that,  we\'ll end the problems,\nI thk, that we see today. We pretend that what we do\ndoesn\'t have an effect on people. We do that  our personal lives. We do that corporate  whether it\'s a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we\'re dog doesn\'t have a huge impact\non other people. I would say to companies,\nthis is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic\n real  say ... ""We\'re sorry. We\'ll fix it."" But there\'s another way,\n I\'ll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen,\ndeeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts,\neven though there\'s no guarantee   that\'s really hard,  I can tell you as a parent,\nthat\'s excruciatgly difficult  to practice gratitude  joy\n those moments  terror, when we\'re wonderg,\n""Can I love you this much? Can I believe  this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?"" just to be able to stop , stead \ncatastrophizg what might happen, to say, ""I\'m just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable\nmeans I\'m alive."" And the last, which I thk\nis probably the most important, is to believe that we\'re enough. Because when we work from a place,\nI believe, that says, ""I\'m enough"" ... then we stop screamg\n start listeng, we\'re kder  gentler\nto the people around us,  we\'re kder  gentler to ourselves. That\'s all I have. Thank you. ()"
132,0.0,"Translator: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Morton Bast  most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearg down upon us. This perfect storm is mountg a grim reality, creasgly grim reality,  we are facg that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology,  that\'s very understable. Now, this perfect storm that we are facg is the result  our risg population, risg towards 10 billion people, l that is turng to desert, ,  course, climate change. Now there\'s no question about it at all: we will only solve the problem  replacg fossil fuels with technology. But fossil fuels, carbon  coal  gas  are by no means the only thg that is causg climate change. Desertification is a fancy word for l that is turng to desert,  this happens only when we create too much bare ground. re\'s no other cause. And I tend to focus on most  the world\'s l that is turng to desert. But I have for you a very simple message that fers more hope than you can image. We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year. On those, it is almost impossible to create vast areas  bare ground. No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly. And we have environments where we have months  humidity followed by months  dryness,  that is where desertification is occurrg. Fortunately, with space technology now, we can look at it from space,  when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well. Generally, what you see  green is not desertifyg,  what you see  brown is,  these are by far the greatest areas  the Earth. About two thirds, I would guess,  the world is desertifyg. I took this picture  the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters  that\'s an ch  ra  was fallg.   it  terms  drums  water, each contag 200 liters. Over 1,000 drums  water fell on every hectare  that l that day.  next day, the l looked like this. Where had that water gone? Some  it ran f as floodg, but most  the water that soaked to the soil simply evaporated out aga, exactly as it does  your garden if you leave the soil uncovered. Now, because the fate  water  carbon are tied to soil organic matter, when we damage soils, you give f carbon. Carbon goes back to the atmosphere. Now you\'re told over  over, repeatedly, that desertification is only occurrg  arid  semiarid areas  the world,  that tall grassls like this one  high rafall are  no consequence. But if you do not look at grassls but look down to them, you fd that most  the soil  that grassl that you\'ve just seen is bare  covered with a crust  algae, leadg to creased runf  evaporation. That is the cancer  desertification that we do not recognize till its termal form. Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock, mostly cattle, sheep  goats, overgrazg the plants, leavg the soil bare  givg f methane. most everybody knows this, from nobel laureates to golf caddies, or was taught it, as I was. Now, the environments like you see here, dusty environments  Africa where I grew up,  I loved wildlife,  so I grew up hatg livestock because  the damage they were dog. And then my university education as an ecologist reforced my beliefs. Well, I have news for you. We were once just as certa that the world was flat. We were wrong then,  we are wrong aga. And I want to vite you now to come along on my journey  reeducation  discovery. When I was a young man, a young biologist  Africa, I was volved  settg aside marvelous areas as future national parks. Now no sooner — this was  the 1950s —  no sooner did we remove the huntg, drumbeatg people to protect the animals, than the l began to deteriorate, as you see  this park that we formed. Now, no livestock were volved, but suspectg that we had too many elephants now, I did the research  I proved we had too many,  I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers  brg them down to a level that the l could susta. Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,  it was political dynamite, frankly. So our government formed a team  experts to evaluate my research. y did. y agreed with me,  over the followg years, we shot 0,000 elephants to try to stop the damage. And it got worse, not better. Lovg elephants as I do, that was the saddest  greatest blunder  my life,  I will carry that to my grave. One good thg did come out  it. It made me absolutely determed to devote my life to fdg solutions. When I came to the United States, I got a shock, to fd national parks like this one desertifyg as badly as anythg  Africa. And there\'d been no livestock on this l for over 70 years. And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid  natural. So I then began lookg at all the research plots I could over the whole  the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification, but I found the opposite, as we see on this research station, where this grassl that was green  1961, by 2002 had changed to that situation. And the authors  the position paper on climate change from which I obtaed these pictures attribute this change to ""unknown processes."" Clearly, we have never understood what is causg desertification, which has destroyed many civilizations  now threatens us globally. We have never understood it. Take one square meter  soil  make it bare like this is down here,  I promise you, you will fd it much colder at dawn  much hotter at midday than that same piece  ground if it\'s just covered with litter, plant litter. You have changed the microclimate. Now, by the time you are dog that  creasg greatly the percentage  bare ground on more than half the world\'s l, you are changg macroclimate. But we have just simply not understood why was it begng to happen 10,000 years ago? Why has it accelerated lately? We had no understg  that. What we had failed to underst was that these seasonal humidity environments  the world, the soil  the vegetation developed with very large numbers  grazg animals,  that these grazg animals developed with ferocious packhuntg predators. Now, the ma defense agast packhuntg predators is to get to herds,  the larger the herd, the safer the dividuals. Now, large herds dung  urate all over their own food,  they have to keep movg,  it was that movement that prevented the overgrazg  plants, while the periodic tramplg ensured good cover  the soil, as we see where a herd has passed. This picture is a typical seasonal grassl. It has just come through four months  ra,  it\'s now gog to eight months  dry season. And watch the change as it goes to this long dry season. Now, all  that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growg season,  if it doesn\'t, the grassl  the soil beg to die. Now, if it does not decay biologically, it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,  this smothers  kills grasses, leadg to a shift to woody vegetation  bare soil, releasg carbon. To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire. But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasg carbon,  worse than that, burng one hectare  grassl gives f more,  more damagg, pollutants than 6,000 cars. And we are burng  Africa, every sgle year, more than one billion hectares  grassls,  almost nobody is talkg about it. We justify the burng, as scientists, because it does remove the dead material  it allows the plants to grow. Now, lookg at this grassl  ours that has gone dry, what could we do to keep that healthy? And bear  md, I\'m talkg  most  the world\'s l now. Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causg desertification  climate change. We cannot burn it without causg desertification  climate change. What are we gog to do? re is only one option, I\'ll repeat to you, only one option left to climatologists  scientists,  that is to do the unthkable,  to use livestock, bunched  movg, as a proxy for former herds  predators,  mimic nature. re is no other alternative left to mankd. So let\'s do that. So on this bit  grassl, we\'ll do it, but just  the foreground. We\'ll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,  we\'ve done so,  look at that. l  that grass is now coverg the soil as dung, ure  litter or mulch, as every one  the gardeners amongst you would underst,  that soil is ready to absorb  hold the ra, to store carbon,  to break down methane. And we did that, without usg fire to damage the soil,  the plants are free to grow. When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use muchvilified livestock to address climate change  desertification, I was faced with a real dilemma. How were we to do it? We\'d had 10,000 years  extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunchg  movg their animals, but they had created the great manmade deserts  the world. n we\'d had 100 years  modern ra science,  that had accelerated desertification, as we first discovered  Africa  then confirmed  the United States,  as you see  this picture  l managed by the federal government. Clearly more was needed than bunchg  movg the animals,  humans, over thouss  years, had never been able to deal with nature\'s complexity. But we biologists  ecologists had never tackled anythg as complex as this. So rather than revent the wheel, I began studyg other pressions to see if anybody had. And I found there were planng techniques that I could take  adapt to our biological need,  from those I developed what we call holistic management  planned grazg, a planng process,  that does address all  nature\'s complexity  our social, environmental, economic complexity. Today, we have young women like this one teachg villages  Africa how to put their animals together to larger herds, plan their grazg to mimic nature,  where we have them hold their animals overnight  we run them  a predatorfriendly manner, because we have a lot  ls,  so on   where they do this  hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields, we are gettg very great creases  crop yield as well. Let\'s look at some results. This is l close to l that we manage  Zimbabwe. It has just come through four months  very good ras it got that year,  it\'s gog to the long dry season. But as you can see, all  that ra, almost  all it, has evaporated from the soil surface. ir river is dry despite the ra just havg ended,  we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid. Now let\'s go to our l nearby on the same day, with the same rafall,  look at that. Our river is flowg  healthy  clean. It\'s fe.  production  grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife, everythg is now more productive,  we have virtually no fear  dry years. And we did that by creasg the cattle  goats 00 percent, planng the grazg to mimic nature  tegrate them with all the elephants, buffalo, giraffe  other animals that we have. But before we began, our l looked like that. This site was bare  erodg for over 30 years regardless  what ra we got. Okay? Watch the marked tree  see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature. This was another site where it had been bare  erodg,  at the base  the marked small tree, we had lost over 30 centimeters  soil. Okay? And aga, watch the change just usg livestock to mimic nature. And there are fallen trees  there now, because the better l is now attractg elephants, etc. This l  Mexico was  terrible condition,  I\'ve had to mark the hill because the change is so pround. () I began helpg a family  the Karoo Desert  the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassl,  thankfully, now their grchildren are on the l with hope for the future. And look at the amazg change  this one, where that gully has completely healed usg nothg but livestock mimickg nature,  once more, we have the third generation  that family on that l with their flag still flyg.  vast grassls  Patagonia are turng to desert as you see here.  man  the middle is an Argentian researcher,  he has documented the steady decle  that l over the years as they kept reducg sheep numbers. y put 25,000 sheep  one flock, really mimickg nature now with planned grazg,  they have documented a 50percent crease  the production  the l  the first year. We now have  the violent Horn  Africa pastoralists planng their grazg to mimic nature  openly sayg it is the only hope they have  savg their families  savg their culture. Netyfive percent  that l can only feed people from animals. I remd you that I am talkg about most  the world\'s l here that controls our fate, cludg the most violent region  the world, where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent  the l. What we are dog globally is causg climate change as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,  maybe more than fossil fuels. But worse than that, it is causg hunger, poverty, violence, social breakdown  war,  as I am talkg to you, millions  men, women  children are sufferg  dyg. And if this contues, we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changg, even after we have elimated the use  fossil fuels. I believe I\'ve shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this. We are already dog so on about 15 million hectares on five contents,  people who underst far more about carbon than I do calculate that, for illustrative purposes, if we do what I am showg you here, we can take enough carbon out  the atmosphere  safely store it  the grassl soils for thouss  years,  if we just do that on about half the world\'s grassls that I\'ve shown you, we can take us back to predustrial levels, while feedg people. I can thk  almost nothg that fers more hope for our planet, for your children,  their children,  all  humanity. Thank you. () Thank you. () Thank you, Chris. Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,  I\'m sure everyone here has, A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you. I\'m just gog to ask you one quick question. When you first start this  you brg  a flock  animals, it\'s desert. What do they eat? How does that part work? How do you start? lan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,  the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is durg me reclamation, where it\'s 100 percent bare. But many years ago, we took the worst l  Zimbabwe, where I fered a £5 note  a hundredmile drive if somebody could fd one grass  a hundredmile drive,  on that, we trebled the stockg rate, the number  animals,  the first year with no feedg, just by the movement, mimickg nature,  usg a sigmoid curve, that prciple. It\'s a little bit technical to expla here, but just that. CA: Well, I would love to  I mean, this such an terestg  important idea.  best people on our blog are gog to come  talk to you  try   I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful. CA: That is an astonishg talk,  an astonishg talk,  I thk you heard that we all are cheerg you on your way. Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris. ()"
133,0.0,"I have had the distct pleasure  livg side two biospheres. Of course we all here  this room live  Biosphere 1. I\'ve also lived  Biosphere 2. And the wonderful thg about that is that I get to compare biospheres. And hopefully from that I get to learn somethg. So what did I learn? Well, here I am side Biosphere 2, makg a pizza. So I am harvestg the wheat,  order to make the dough. And then  course I have to milk the goats  feed the goats  order to make the cheese. It took me four months  Biosphere 2 to make a pizza. Here  Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two mutes, because I pick up the phone  I call  say, ""Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"" So Biosphere 2 was essentially a threeacre, entirely sealed, miature world that I lived  for two years  20 mutes. () Over the top it was sealed with steel  glass, underneath it was sealed with a pan  steel  essentially entirely sealed. So we had our own miature raforest, a private beach with a coral reef. We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert. We had our own halfacre farm that we had to grow everythg. And  course we had our human habitat, where we lived. Back  the mid\'80s when we were designg Biosphere 2, we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions. I mean, what is a biosphere? Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere  life around the Earth, right? Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you\'re gog to build one. And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed  that is, nothg goes  or out at all, no material   energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is. This is a chamber that was 1/00th the size  Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module. And the very first day that this fellow, John len, walked , to spend a couple  days  there with all the plants  animals  bacteria that we\'d put  there to hopefully keep him alive, the doctors were credibly concerned that he was gog to succumb to some dreadful tox, or that his lungs were gog to get choked with bacteria or somethg, fungus. But  course none  that happened. And over the ensug few years, there were great sagas about designg Biosphere 2. But by 1991 we fally had this thg built. And it was time for us to go   give it a go. We needed to know, is life this malleable? Can you take this biosphere, that has evolved on a planetary scale,  jam it to a little bottle,  will it survive?  questions. And we wanted to know this both for beg able to go somewhere else  the universe  if we were gog to go to Mars, for stance, would we take a biosphere with us, to live  it? We also wanted to know so we can underst more about the Earth that we all live . Well,  1991 it was fally time for us to go   try out this baby. Let\'s take it on a maiden voyage. Will it work? Or will somethg happen that we can\'t underst  we can\'t fix, thereby negatg the concept  manmade biospheres? So eight  us went : four men  four women. More on that later. () And this is the world that we lived . So, on the top, we had these beautiful raforests  an ocean,  underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it, which is where all the pumps  the valves  the water tanks  the air hlers,  all  that. One  the Biospherians called it ""garden  Eden on top  an aircraft carrier."" And then also we had the human habitat  course, with the laboratories,  all  that. This is the agriculture. It was essentially an organic farm.  day I walked to Biosphere 2, I was, for the first time, breathg a completely different atmosphere than everybody else  the world, except seven other people. At that moment I became part  that biosphere. And I don\'t mean that  an abstract sense; I mean it rather literally. When I breathed out, my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growg. And we ate an awful lot  the sweet potatoes. () And those sweet potatoes became part  me. In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato. I literally was eatg the same carbon over  over aga. I was eatg myself  some strange sort  bizarre way. When it came to our atmosphere, however, it wasn\'t that much  a joke over the long term, because it turned out that we were losg oxygen, quite a lot  oxygen. And we knew that we were losg CO2. And so we were workg to sequester carbon. Good lord  we know that term now. We were growg plants like crazy. We were takg their biomass, storg them  the basement, growg plants, gog around, around, around, tryg to take all  that carbon out  the atmosphere. We were tryg to stop carbon from gog to the atmosphere. We stopped irrigatg our soil, as much as we could. We stopped tillg, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from gog to the air. But our oxygen was gog down faster than our CO2 was gog up, which was quite unexpected, because we had seen them gog  tem  the test module. And it was like playg atomic hideseek. We had lost seven tons  oxygen. And we had no clue where it was. And I tell you, when you lose a lot  oxygen   our oxygen went down quite far; it went from 21 percent down to 1.2 percent  my goodness, do you feel dreadful. I mean we were draggg ourselves around the Biosphere. And we had sleep apnea at night. So you\'d wake up gaspg with breath, because your blood chemistry has changed. And that you literally do that. You stop breathg  then you  (Gasps)  take a breath  it wakes you up. And it\'s very irritatg. And everybody outside thought we were dyg. I mean, the media was makg it sound like were were dyg. And I had to call up my mother every other day sayg, ""No, Mum, it\'s fe, fe. We\'re not dead. We\'re fe. We\'re fe."" And the doctor was,  fact, checkg us to make sure we were,  fact, fe. But  fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen. And one day he couldn\'t add up a le  figures. And it was time for us to put oxygen . And you might thk, well, ""Boy, your life support system was failg you. Wasn\'t that dreadful?"" Yes. In a sense it was terrifyg. Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time, if it really got bad, though who was gog to say, ""I can\'t take it anymore!""? Not me, that was for sure. But on the other h, it was the scientific gold  the project, because we could really crank this baby up, as a scientific tool,  see if we could,  fact, fd where those seven tons  oxygen had gone. And we did deed fd it. And we found it  the concrete. Essentially it had done somethg very simple. We had put too much carbon  the soil  the form  compost. It broke down; it took oxygen out  the air; it put CO2 to the air;  it went to the concrete. Pretty straightforward really. So at the end  the two years when we came out, we were elated, because,  fact, although you might say we had discovered somethg that was quite ""uhh,"" when your oxygen is gog down, stopped workg, essentially,  your life support system, that\'s a very bad failure. Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it. And nothg else emerged that really was as serious as that. And we proved the concept, more or less. People, on the other h, was a different subject. We were  yeah I don\'t know that we were fixable. We all went quite nuts, I will say. And the day I came out  Biosphere 2, I was thrilled I was gog to see all my family  my friends. For two years I\'d been seeg people through the glass. And everybody ran up to me. And I recoiled. y stank! People stk! We stk  hairspray  underarm deodorant,  all kds  stuff. Now we had stuff side Biosphere to keep ourselves clean, but nothg with perfume. And boy do we stk out here. Not only that, but I lost touch  where my food came from. I had been growg all my own food. I had no idea what was  my food, where it came from. I didn\'t even recognize half the names  most  the food that I was eatg. In fact, I would st for hours  the aisles  shops, readg all the names on all  the thgs. People must have thought I was nuts. It was really quite astonishg. And I slowly lost track  where I was  this big biosphere,  this big biosphere that we all live . In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,  it had an impact on me, very viscerally, very literally. So I went about my busess: Paragon Space Development Corporation, a little firm I started with people while I was  the Biosphere, because I had nothg else to do. And one  the thgs we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,  what can you do with them? And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station. We had one on the shuttle  one on the International Space Station, for 16 months, where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles  space  really pushg the envelope  understg how malleable our life systems are. And I\'m also proud to announce that you\'re gettg a sneak preview  on Friday we\'re gog to announce that we\'re actually formg a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon, which is gog to be pretty fun. And the legacy  that is a system that we were designg: an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars. And part  that is that we had to model very rapid circulation  CO2  oxygen  water through this plant system. As a result  that modelg I ended up  all places,  Eritrea,  the Horn  Africa. Eritrea, formerly part  Ethiopia, is one  those places that is astonishgly beautiful, credibly stark,  I have no understg  how people eke out a livg there. It is so dry. This is what I saw. But this is also what I saw. I saw a company that had taken seawater  s,  they were growg a kd  crop that will grow on pure salt water without havg to treat it. And it will produce a food crop. In this case it was oilseed. It was astonishg. y were also producg mangroves  a plantation. And the mangroves were providg wood  honey  leaves for the animals, so that they could produce milk  whatnot, like we had  the Biosphere. And all  it was comg from this: shrimp farms. Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth, frankly, from an environmental pot  view. y pour huge amounts  pollutants to the ocean. y also pollute their nextdoor neighbors. So they\'re all shittg each other\'s ponds, quite literally. And what this project was dog was takg the effluent  these,  turng them to all  this food. y were literally turng pollution to abundance for a desert people. y had created an dustrial ecosystem,  a sense. I was there because I was actually modelg the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program, under the U.N. Kyoto Protocol system. And as I was modelg this mangrove swamp, I was thkg to myself, ""How do you put a box around this?"" When I\'m modelg a plant  a box, literally, I know where to draw the boundary. In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea. Well,  course you have to draw the boundary around the whole  the Earth. And underst its teractions with the entire Earth. And put your project  that context. Around the world today we\'re seeg an credible transformation, from what I would call a biocidal species, one that  whether we tentionally or untentionally  have designed our systems to kill life, a lot  the time. This is  fact, this beautiful photograph, is  fact over the Amazon. And here the light green are areas  massive deforestation. And those beautiful wispy clouds are,  fact, fires, humanmade fires. We\'re  the process  transformg from this, to what I would call a biophilic society, one where we learn to nurture society. Now it may not seem like it, but we are. It is happeng all across the world,  every kd  walk  life,  every kd  career  dustry that you can thk . And I thk ten times people get lost  that. y go, ""But how can I possibly fd my way  that? It\'s such a huge subject."" And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. This is the story  a rake  my backyard. This was my backyard, very early on, when I bought my property. And  Arizona,  course, everybody puts gravel down. And they like to keep everythg beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away. And on Sunday morng the neighbors leaf blower comes out,  I want to throttle them. It\'s a certa type  aesthetic. We\'re very uncomfortable with untidess. And I threw away my rake. And I let all  the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property. And over time, essentially what have I been dog? I\'ve been buildg topsoil. And so now all the birds come . And I have hawks. And I have an oasis. This is what happens every sprg. For six weeks, six to eight weeks, I have this flush  green oasis. This is actually  a riparian area. And all  Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt  throw away the rake.  small stuff counts.  Industrial Revolution   Prometheus  has given us this, the ability to light up the world. It has also given us this, the ability to look at the world from the outside. Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to,  compare it to this biosphere. But we can look at the world,  try to underst where we are  its context,  how we choose to teract with it. And if you lose where you are  your biosphere, or are perhaps havg a difficulty connectg with where you are  the biosphere, I would say to you, take a deep breath.  yogis had it right. Breath does,  fact, connect us all  a very literal way. Take a breath now. And as you breathe, thk about what is  your breath. re perhaps is the CO2 from the person sittg nextdoor to you. Maybe there is a little bit  oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here. It also connects us  time. re may be some carbon  your breath from the dosaurs. re could also be carbon that you are exhalg now that will be  the breath  your greatgreatgreatgrchildren. Thank you.

134,0.0,"What\'s the scariest thg you\'ve ever done? Or another way to say it is, what\'s the most dangerous \nthg that you\'ve ever done? And why did you do it? I know what the most dangerous thg is that I\'ve ever done because  does the math. You look back to the first five shuttle launches, the odds  a catastrophic event durg the first five shuttle launches was one  ne. And even when I first flew  the shuttle back  1995, 7 shuttle flight, the odds were still now that we look back about one  38 or so  one  35, one  0. Not great odds, so it\'s a really terestg day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center  you\'re gog to go to space that day because you realize by the end  the day you\'re either gog to be floatg \neffortlessly, gloriously  space, or you\'ll be dead. You go to, at the Kennedy Space Center, the suitup room, the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed , that Neil Armstrong  Buzz dr got suited  to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon. And I got my pressure suit built around me  rode down outside  the van headg out to the launchpad   the Astro van  headg out to the launchpad,  as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center, it\'s normally predawn,   the distance, lit up by the huge xenon lights, is your spaceship  the vehicle that is gog to take you f the planet.  crew is sittg  the Astro van sort  hushed, almost holdg hs, lookg at that as it gets bigger  bigger. We ride the elevator up  we crawl , on your hs  knees to the spaceship, one at a time,  you worm your way up to your chair  plunk yourself down on your back. And the hatch is closed,  suddenly, what has been a lifetime  both dreams  denial is becomg real, somethg that I dreamed about,  fact, that I chose to do when I was ne years old, is now suddenly with not too many mutes  actually happeng. In the astronaut busess  the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle; it\'s the most complicated flyg mache ever built. And  the astronaut busess, \nwe have a sayg, which is, there is no problem so bad that you can\'t make it worse. () And so you\'re very conscious  the cockpit; you\'re thkg about all  the thgs that you might have to do, all the switches  all the \nwickets you have to go through. And as the time gets closer  closer, this excitement is buildg. And then about three  a \nhalf mutes before launch, the huge nozzles on the back, like the size  big church bells, swg back  forth  the mass  them is such that it sways the whole vehicle, like the vehicle is alive underneath you, like an elephant gettg up \nf its knees or somethg. And then about 30 seconds before launch, the vehicle is completely alive  it is ready to go  the APUs are runng, the computers are all selfcontaed, it\'s ready to leave the planet. And 15 seconds before launch, this happens: (Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10, ne, eight, seven, six  (Space shuttle preparg for takef)  start, two, one, booster ignition,  liftf  \nthe space shuttle y, returng to the space station, pavg the way ... (Space shuttle takg f) Chris Hadfield: It is credibly powerful to be on board one  these thgs. You are  the grip  somethg that is vastly more powerful than yourself. It\'s shakg you so hard you can\'t focus on the struments  front  you. It\'s like you\'re  the jaws  some enormous dog  there\'s a foot  the small  your back pushg you to space, acceleratg wildly straight up, shoulderg your way through the air,  you\'re  a very complex place  payg attention, watchg the vehicle go through each one  its wickets with a steadily creasg smile on your face. After two mutes, those solid rockets explode f  then you just have the liquid enges, the hydrogen  oxygen,  it\'s as if you\'re  a dragster with your foot to the floor  acceleratg like you\'ve never accelerated. You get lighter  lighter, the force gets on us heavier  heavier. It feels like someone\'s pourg cement on you or somethg. Until fally, after about eight mutes  0 seconds or so, we are fally at exactly the right altitude, exactly the right speed, the right direction, the enge shut f,  we\'re weightless. And we\'re alive. It\'s an amazg experience. But why would we take that risk? Why would you do somethg that dangerous? In my case the answer is fairly straightforward. I was spired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do. I watched the first people walk on the moon  to me, it was just an obvious thg  I want to somehow turn myself to that. But the real question is, how do you deal with the danger  it  the fear that comes from it? How do you deal with fear versus danger? And havg the goal  md,\nthkg about where it might lead, directed me to a life  lookg at all  the small details to allow this to become possible, to be able to launch  go \nhelp build a space station where you are on board a millionpound creation that\'s gog around the world at five miles a second, eight kilometers a second, around the world 16 times a day, with experiments on board that are teachg us what the substance  the universe is made   runng 200 experiments side. But maybe even more importantly, allowg us to see the world  a way that is impossible through any other means, to be able to look down  have  if your jaw could drop, it would  the jawdroppg gorgeousness  the turng orb like a selfpropelled art gallery  fantastic, constantly changg beauty that is the world itself. And you see, because  the speed, a sunrise or a sunset every 5 mutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part  all that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are  a oneperson spaceship that is your spacesuit,  you\'re gog through space with the world. It\'s an entirely different perspective, you\'re not lookg up at the universe, you  the Earth are gog \nthrough the universe together. And you\'re holdg on with one h, lookg at the world turn beside you. It\'s roarg silently with color  texture as it pours by mesmerizgly next to you. And if you can tear your eyes away from that  you look under your arm down at the rest  everythg, it\'s unfathomable blackness, with a texture you feel like you \ncould stick your h to.  you are holdg on with one h, one lk to the other seven billion people. And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went bld,  I didn\'t know why. Suddenly my left eye slammed shut  great pa  I couldn\'t figure out why my eye wasn\'t workg. I was thkg, what do I do next? I thought, well maybe that\'s why we have two eyes, so I kept workg. But unfortunately, without gravity, tears don\'t fall. So you just get a bigger  \nbigger ball  whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually, the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it \nacross the bridge  your nose like a ty little waterfall  goes ""goosh"" to your other eye,  now I was completely bld outside the spaceship. So what\'s the scariest thg you\'ve ever done? () Maybe it\'s spiders. A lot  people are afraid  spiders. I thk you should be afraid  spiders  spiders are creepy  they\'ve got long, hairy legs,  spiders like this one, the brown recluse  it\'s horrible. If a brown recluse bites you, you end with one  these \nhorrible, big necrotic thgs on your leg  there might be one right now sittg on the chair behd you,  fact. And how do you know? And so a spider ls on you,  you go through this great, spasmy attack because spiders are scary. But then you could say, well \nis there a brown recluse sittg on the chair beside me or not? I don\'t know. Are there brown recluses here? So if you actually do the research, you fd out that  the world there are about \n50,000 different types  spiders,  there are about two dozen that are venomous out  50,000. And if you\'re  Canada, because  the cold wters here  B.C., there\'s about 720, \n730 different types  spiders  there\'s one  one  that is venomous,  its venom isn\'t even fatal, it\'s just kd  like a nasty stg. And that spider  not only that, but that spider has beautiful markgs on it, it\'s like ""I\'m dangerous. I got a big radiation \nsymbol on my back, it\'s the black widow."" So, if you\'re even slightly careful you can avoid runng to the one spider   it lives close the ground, you\'re walkg along, you are \nnever gog to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you. Spider webs like this, it doesn\'t build those, it builds them down  the corners. And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male; it doesn\'t care about you. So  fact, the next time you walk to a spiderweb, you don\'t need to panic  go \nwith your caveman reaction.  danger is entirely different than the fear. How do you get around it, though? How do you change your behavior? Well, next time you see a spiderweb, have a good look, make sure \nit\'s not a black widow spider,  then walk to it. And then you see another spiderweb  walk to that one. It\'s just a little bit  fluffy stuff. It\'s not a big deal. And the spider that may come out is \nno more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly. And then I guarantee you if you \nwalk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior, your caveman reaction,  you will now be able to walk \n the park  the morng  not worry about that spiderweb  or to your grma\'s attic or whatever, to your own basement. And you can apply this to anythg. If you\'re outside on a spacewalk  you\'re blded, your natural reaction would be to panic, I thk. It would make you nervous  worried. But we had considered all the venom,  we had practiced with a whole \nvariety  different spiderwebs. We knew everythg there is to know about the spacesuit  we traed underwater thouss  times. And we don\'t just practice thgs gog right, we practice thgs gog wrong all the time, so that you are constantly walkg \nthrough those spiderwebs. And not just underwater, but \nalso  virtual reality labs with the helmet  the gloves so you feel like it\'s realistic. So when you fally actually \nget outside on a spacewalk, it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time. And even if you\'re blded, your natural, panicky reaction doesn\'t happen. Instead you kd  look around  go, ""Okay, I can\'t see, but I can hear, I can talk, Scott Parazynski is out here with me. He could come over  help me."" We actually practiced capacitated crew rescue, so he could float me like a blimp  stuff me to the airlock if he had to. I could fd my own way back. It\'s not nearly as big a deal. And actually, if you keep on cryg for a while, whatever that gunk was that\'s \n your eye starts to dilute  you can start to see aga,  Houston, if you negotiate with them, they will let you then keep workg. We fished everythg on the spacewalk  when we came back side, Jeff got some cotton battg  took \nthe crusty stuff around my eyes,  it turned out it was just the antifog, sort  a mixture  oil  soap, that got  my eye. And now we use Johnson\'s No More Tears, which we probably should\'ve been usg right from the very begng. () But the key to that is by lookg at the difference between perceived danger  actual danger, where is the real risk? What is the real thg that you should be afraid ? Not just a generic fear  bad thgs happeng. You can fundamentally change \nyour reaction to thgs so that it allows you to go places  see thgs  do thgs that otherwise would be completely denied to you ... where you could see the \nhardpan south  the Sahara, or you can see New York City  a way that is almost dreamlike, or the unconscious ggham \n Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection  small puddles. You can see the fault les  San Francisco  the way the water pours out under the bridge, just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear. You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. It\'s time to come home at the end. This is our spaceship, the Soyuz, that little one. Three  us climb ,  then this spaceship detaches from the station  falls to the atmosphere. se two parts here actually melt, we jettison them  they burn up  the atmosphere.  only part that survives is the little bullet that we\'re ridg ,  it falls to the atmosphere,   essence you are ridg a meteorite home,  ridg meteorites is scary,  it ought to be. But stead  ridg to the atmosphere just screamg, like you would if suddenly you found yourself ridg a meteorite back to Earth  ()  stead, 20 years previously we had started studyg Russian,  then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics  Russian,  then we learned vehicle control theory,  then we got to the simulator  practiced over  over  over aga. And  fact, you can fly this meteorite  steer it  l  about a 15kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth. So  fact, when our crew was comg back to the atmosphere side the Soyuz, we weren\'t screamg, we were laughg; it was fun. And when the great big parachute opened, we knew that if it didn\'t open there\'s a second parachute,  it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism. So we came back, we came thunderg back to Earth  this is what it looked like to l  a Soyuz,  Kazakhstan. (Video) Reporter: And you can see one  those search  recovery helicopters, once aga that helicopter part  dozen such Russian Mi8 helicopters. Touchdown  3:1  8 seconds, a.m. Central Time. CH: And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your \nspaceship at the ground  it tumbles end over end, but you\'re ready for it you\'re  a custombuilt seat, you know how the shock absorber works. And then eventually the Russians reach , drag you out, plunk you to a chair,  you can now look back at what was an credible experience. You have taken the dreams  that neyearold boy, which were impossible  dauntgly scary, dauntgly terrifyg,  put them to practice,  figured out a way to reprogram yourself, to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set  experiences  a level  spiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. Just to fish, they asked me to play that guitar. I know this song,  it\'s really a tribute to the genius  David Bowie himself, but it\'s also, I thk, a reflection  the fact that we are not maches explorg the universe, we are people,  we\'re takg that ability to adapt  that ability to underst  the ability to take our own selfperception to a new place.

135,0.0,"right. I\'m gog to show you a couple  images from a very divertg paper\n    Ultrasound  Medice. I\'m gog to go way out on a limb  say\nthat it is the most divertg paper ever published \n   Ultrasound  Medice.  title is ""Observations\n InUtero Masturbation."" () Okay. Now on the left you can see\nthe h  that\'s the big arrow   the penis on the right.\n h hoverg. And over here we have,  the words  radiologist\nIsrael Meisner, "" h graspg the penis  a fashion\nresemblg masturbation movements."" Bear  md this was an ultrasound, so it would have been movg images. Orgasm is a reflex\n the autonomic nervous system. Now, this is the part\n the nervous system that deals with the thgs\nthat we don\'t consciously control, like digestion, heart rate\n sexual arousal. And the orgasm reflex can be triggered\nby a surprisgly broad range  put. Genital stimulation. Duh. But also, Ksey terviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm\nby havg someone stroke her eyebrow. People with spal cord juries, like paraplegias, quadriplegias, will ten develop a very,\nvery sensitive area right above the level  their jury, wherever that is. re is such a thg\nas a knee orgasm  the literature. I thk the most curious one\nthat I came across was a case report  a woman who had an orgasm every time\nshe brushed her teeth. () Somethg  the complex\nsensorymotor action  brushg her teeth was triggerg orgasm. And she went to a neurologist,\nwho was fascated. He checked to see\nif it was somethg  the toothpaste, but no  it happened with any br. y stimulated her gums with a toothpick,\nto see if that was dog it. No. It was the whole, you know, motion. And the amazg thg to me is that you would thk this woman\nwould have excellent oral hygiene. () Sadly  this is what it said\n the journal paper  ""She believed that she was\npossessed by demons  switched to mouthwash\nfor her oral care."" It\'s so sad. () When I was workg on the book, I terviewed a woman\nwho can thk herself to orgasm. She was part  a study\nat Rutgers . You\'ve got to love that. Rutgers. So I terviewed her  Oakl,\n a sushi restaurant. And I said, ""So, could you\ndo it right here?"" And she said, ""Yeah, but you know I\'d rather\nfish my meal if you don\'t md."" () But afterwards, she was kd enough\nto demonstrate on a bench outside. It was remarkable.\nIt took about one mute. And I said to her, ""Are you just dog this all the time?"" () She said, ""No. Honestly, when I get home,\nI\'m usually too tired."" () She said that the last time\nshe had done it was on the Disneyl tram. ()  headquarters for orgasm,\nalong the spal nerve, is somethg called the sacral nerve root, which is back here. And if you trigger,\nif you stimulate with an electrode, the precise spot,\nyou will trigger an orgasm. And it is a fact that you can trigger\nspal reflexes  dead people  a certa kd  dead person,\na beatgheart cadaver. Now this is somebody who is bradead, legally dead, defitely checked out, but is beg kept alive on a respirator, so that their organs will be oxygenated\nfor transplantation. Now  one  these bradead people, if you trigger the right spot, you will see somethg every now  then. re is a reflex called\nthe Lazarus reflex. And this is  I\'ll demonstrate\nas best I can, not beg dead. It\'s like this. You trigger the spot.  dead guy, or gal, goes... like that. Very unsettlg for people\nworkg  pathology labs. () Now, if you can trigger\nthe Lazarus reflex  a dead person, why not the orgasm reflex? I asked this question\nto a bra death expert, Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough\nto return my emails. () I said, ""So, could you conceivably\ntrigger an orgasm  a dead person?"" She said, ""Yes, if the sacral nerve\nis beg oxygenated, you conceivably could."" Obviously it wouldn\'t be\nas much fun for the person. But it would be an orgasm  () nonetheless. re is a researcher\nat the   abama who does orgasm research. I said to her,\n""You should do an experiment. You know? You can get cadavers\nif you work at a university."" I said, ""You should actually do this."" She said, ""You get the human subjects\nreview board approval for this one."" () Accordg to 1930s marriage manual author, odoor van De Velde, a slight semal odor can be detected\non the breath  a woman with about an hour\nafter sexual tercourse. odoor van De Velde was somethg\n a semen connoisseur. () This is a guy writg a book,\n""Ideal Marriage,"" you know. Very heavy hetero guy. But he wrote  this book,\n""Ideal Marriage""  he said that he could differentiate\nbetween the semen  a young man, which he said had a fresh,\nexhilaratg smell,  the semen  mature men,\nwhose semen smelled, quote, ""Remarkably like that  the flowers\n the Spanish chestnut. Sometimes quite freshly floral,  then aga sometimes\nextremely pungent."" () Okay. In 1999,  the state  Israel,\na man began hiccuppg. And this was one  those cases\nthat went on  on. He tried everythg his friends suggested. Nothg seemed to help. Days went by. At a certa pot, the man,\nstill hiccuppg, had sex with his wife. And lo  behold, the hiccups went away. He told his doctor,\nwho published a case report  a Canadian medical journal\nunder the title, ""Sexual Intercourse as a Potential\nTreatment for Intractable Hiccups."" I love this article because\nat a certa pot they suggested that unattached hiccuppers\ncould try masturbation. () I love that because there is like a whole\ndemographic: unattached hiccuppers. () Married, sgle, unattached hiccupper. In the 1900s, early 1900s, a lot  gynecologists believed\nthat when a woman has an orgasm, the contractions serve to suck\nthe semen up through the cervix  sort  deliver it\nreally quickly to the egg, thereby uppg the odds  conception. It was called the ""upsuck"" theory. () If you go all the way back to Hippocrates, physicians believed that orgasm  women was not just helpful\nfor conception, but necessary. Doctors back then\nwere routely tellg men the importance  pleasurg their wives. Marriagemanual author  semensniffer\nodoor van De Velde  () has a le  his book. I loved this guy. I got a lot  mileage\nout  odoor van De Velde. He had this le  his book that supposedly comes\nfrom the Habsburg Monarchy, where there was an empress Maria resa, who was havg trouble conceivg. And apparently the royal\ncourt physician said to her, ""I am  the opion that the vulva\n your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time\nprior to tercourse."" () It\'s apparently, I don\'t know,\non the record somewhere. Masters  Johnson: now we\'re movg forward to the 1950s. Masters  Johnson were upsuck skeptics, which is also really fun to say. y didn\'t buy it. And they decided,\nbeg Masters  Johnson, that they would get to the bottom  it. y brought women to the lab\n I thk it was five women   outfitted them with cervical caps\ncontag artificial semen. And  the artificial semen\nwas a radioopaque substance, such that it would show up on an Xray. This is the 1950s. Anyway, these women\nsat  front  an Xray device. And they masturbated. And Masters  Johnson looked to see\nif the semen was beg sucked up. Did not fd any evidence  upsuck. You may be wonderg,\n""How do you make artificial semen?"" () I have an answer for you.\nI have two answers. You can use flour  water,\nor cornstarch  water. I actually found three\nseparate recipes  the literature. () My favorite beg the one that says  you know, they have\nthe gredients listed,  then  a recipe\nit will say, for example, ""Yield: two dozen cupcakes."" This one said, ""Yield: one ejaculate."" () re\'s another way that orgasm\nmight boost fertility. This one volves men. Sperm that sit around  the body\nfor a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective\nat headbangg their way to the egg. British sexologist Roy Lev\nhas speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic\n frequent masturbators. He said, ""If I keep tossg myself f\nI get fresh sperm beg made."" Which I thought\nwas an terestg idea, theory. So now you have an evolutionary excuse. () Okay. () l righty. re is considerable evidence\nfor upsuck  the animal kgdom  pigs, for stance. In Denmark, the Danish ional Committee\nfor Pig Production found out that if you\nsexually stimulate a sow while you artificially semate her, you will see a sixpercent crease\n the farrowg rate, which is the number  piglets produced. So they came up with this fivepot\nstimulation plan for the sows. re is posters they put  the barn,\n they have a DVD. And I got a copy  this DVD. () This is my unveilg,\nbecause I am gog to show you a clip. () So, okay. Now, here we go, la la la, f to work. It all looks very nocent. He\'s gog to be dog thgs\nwith his hs that the boar would use\nhis snout, lackg hs. Okay. () This is it.  boar has a very odd\ncourtship repertoire. () This is to mimic the weight  the boar. () You should know, the clitoris\n the pig is side the vaga. So this may be\nsort  titillatg for her. Here we go. () And the happy result. () I love this video. re is a pot  this video,\ntowards the begng, where they zoom  for a close up\n his h with his weddg rg, as if to say,\n""It\'s okay, it\'s just his job. He really does like women."" () Okay. When I was  Denmark,\nmy host was named Anne Marie. And I said, ""So why don\'t you just\nstimulate the clitoris  the pig? Why don\'t you have the farmers do that? That\'s not one  your five steps."" I have to read you\nwhat she said, because I love it. She said, ""It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch\nunderneath the vulva. So we thought, let\'s not mention\nthe clitoris right now."" () Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however,\ncan purchase a  this is true  a sow vibrator, that hangs on the sperm\nfeeder tube to vibrate. Because, as I mentioned,\nthe clitoris is side the vaga. So possibly, you know,\na little more arousg than it looks. And I also said to her, ""Now, these sows. I mean,\nyou may have noticed there.  sow doesn\'t look to be\n the throes  ecstasy."" And she said, you can\'t make\nthat conclusion, because animals don\'t register\npa or pleasure on their faces  the same way that we do. Pigs, for example, are more like dogs. y use the upper half  the face;\nthe ears are very expressive. So you\'re not really sure\nwhat\'s gog on with the pig. Primates, on the other h,\nwe use our mouths more. This is the ejaculation face\n the stumptailed macaque. () And, terestgly, this has been\nobserved  female macaques, but only when mountg another female. () Masters  Johnson. In the 1950s, they decided,\nokay, we\'re gog to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle, from arousal, all the way through orgasm,\n men  women  everythg that happens  the human body. Okay, with women,\na lot  this is happeng side. This did not stop Masters  Johnson. y developed an artificial\ncoition mache. This is basically\na penis camera on a motor. re is a phallus, clear acrylic phallus,\nwith a camera  a light source, attached to a motor\nthat is kd  gog like this. And the woman would have sex with it. That is what they would do.\nPretty amazg. Sadly, this device has been dismantled. This just kills me,\nnot because I wanted to use it  I wanted to see it. () One fe day, fred Ksey decided to calculate the average distance\ntraveled by ejaculated semen. This was not idle curiosity. Doctor Ksey had heard   there was a theory gog around\nat the time, this beg the 190s  that the force with which\nsemen is thrown agast the cervix was a factor  fertility. Ksey thought it was bunk,\nso he got to work. He got together  his lab 300 men, a measurg tape,\n a movie camera. () And  fact, he found\nthat  three quarters  the men the stuff just kd  slopped out. It wasn\'t spurted or thrown\nor ejected under great force. However, the record holder led just shy  the eightfoot mark,\nwhich is impressive. () () Yes. Exactly. () Sadly, he\'s anonymous.\nHis name is not mentioned. () In his writeup\n this experiment  his book, Ksey wrote, ""Two sheets were laid down to protect\nthe oriental carpets."" () Which is my second favorite le\n the entire oeuvre  fred Ksey. My favorite beg, ""Cheese crumbs\nspread before a pair  copulatg rats will distract the female,\nbut not the male."" () Thank you very much. () Thanks!"

140,0.0,"re’s a sayg  Hong Kong kung fu movies: “Wai faai bat po.” It means ""only speed is unbreakable."" “Wai faai bat po.” That’s  Cantonese, a language with tones, which English speakers have trouble distguishg.\nSo when an American says that phrase with the wrong tones— “wifi bat po”—you\nget a Cantonese meme. ""It became kd  a joke that people will\nsend to each other. It\'s like oh, this badass wifi is so good. “Wai faai bat po.” It\'s\nquite funny. If English is your first language though,\nyou might be more familiar with a different joke: “Supplies!” That’s the notion that East Asians mix up\ntheir Rs  Ls  English: “Oh herro prease.” It’s a runng gag  Lost  Translation, an Oscarwng film about two Americans\nwho are sad  Japan. “Lat pack. You know lat pack?” “Rat?\nRat pack.”  movie makes communication with the locals\nseem hopeless. “Hey. Lip my stockg.” “Hey? Lip them?” And at one pot Scarlett Johansson\'s character asks: ""Why do they switch the Rs  the L’s here?"" ""Oh, for yucks."" This movie may be a bit rrrrr— rude, but it’s not a terrible question to ask.\nBecause if you’re genuely curious, a foreign accent gives us chance to learn somethg\nabout another language. So this trope has been applied to Japanese,\nKorean,  Chese speakers. ""McFry!"" ""Herro."" ""Fa ra ra ra ra."" But, all  these languages deal with Rs  Ls  different ways. First though, we need to talk about the R sound  English. It turns out that there isn’t\njust one way to pronounce it. ""Oh it’s credibly varied."" Eleanor Lawson uses ultrasound to study English phonetics.\n""You have trilled r’s which are sort  a rrr sound. You can probably hear my tapped\nr. So I do a ara sound. Varied. You can have a retrlex R where your tongue essentially\ncurls upside down under your palatal arch. ""Run. Run.""\nShe says the bunchedr, which is common  North American english, is particularly complex. ""Nurse. Nurse."" Say the word fur. Fur. How would you tell\nsomeone where to put their tongue to make that R?  middle  the tongue rises up  the mouth, while the root  the tongue is pullg backwards. You might have some lip roundg as well. R sounds like this, where the air flow isn’t\nblocked by the tongue or the lips, are called “approximates”  phonetics. ""So formg all  these structures at the same time could be very difficult for someone\nwho is not used to producg that.""  rsound is one  the last consonants\nthat englishspeakg kids learn to say. It takes up to 5 adorable years for them to figure\nit out. “Purple. And red” And the Lsound  English can change dependg on its position  a word. Say the words “ladle”\nor “level.” That first L is a ""clear L."" You can probably\nfeel your tongue touchg the top  the mouth, right behd your front teeth. As  “led.”\nBut the l at the end  the word is a “dark L,"" where the tip  the tongue might not\neven touch top  your mouth at all. ""A dark L is where the back  the tongue\nis movg up toward the st palate  it gives it an oish sound like an ""Uhh O"". “Level.”\n“Level.” So the English R  L are complicated, but\nstill, ""Lat Pack,"" rrr, llll they seem like pretty different sounds. It might help to look at Spanish  say the word salero. “Salero. Salt Shaker.” “Salero”\n“Salero” This R is made with a flap  the tongue on\nthe ridge behd the front teeth  \xa0that’s not too far away from where the L is pronounced. Japanese has that Rsound. It doesn’t have\nthe lll  “lake” or the rrr  “red.” ""We have ra ri ru re ro, which sounds kd\n similar to both L  R."" Those are the 5 syllables  Japanese that\nconta the tongueflap sound: “ra ri ru re ro"" Try sayg them: “ra ri ru re\nro.” When they’re converted to the Lat alphabet,\nthey’re spelled like this, with the letter “r”. But the Japanese Rsound is actually\ncloser to our Lsound “la” than it is to the english ""ra.""\n""My name is Mariko  for all my englishspeakg friends, their tuition to say is marieko.\nAnd how I expla to them is just image my name spelled with Maliko  you should\nbe fe. When words migrate from English to Japanese,\nboth Rs  Ls become Japanese Rs. “Garasu.” “Karendaa.” “Borgu.” “Raito.” re are thouss  these loan words that Japanese speakers have to relearn with rrrs\n llls, which are two sounds that Japanese ears weren’t tuned to distguish  the first\nplace. Like Japanese, Korean doesn’t have the English\nrrr sound. y have this letter. It\'s ""rieul."" ""leer?"" ""leeul."" ""leeer."" ""Ul."" ""Ul. Leeul."" ""Like my tongue is gog straight up to the ro  my mouth. Ul. ""Rieul.""\nIt takes on a different sound dependg on its position with the word.\nSo when it\'s followed by a vowel, it has the flap sound like a Japanese R. “Duriseo.\nDuriseo."" That also means it’s written with the letter “r” when converted to Lat\nscript. “Duriseo.” But when it’s at the end  a word or is followed by a consonant,\nit sounds more like an Lsound  it’s transcribed  the Lat alphabet as “L”. So it’s pretty unlikely that Korean speakers would say “herro” sce their Lsound\ncan map on to the english L. But the “dark L” doesn’t exist  Korean.\n\xa0So when they’re new to english, Koreans might to use their own L sound  spots\nwhere we would use a dark L, near the end  words. \xa0“As the story unfolds, someone\nmay change the world.” re are at least 8 major Chese languages,\nbut we’ll look at Mar  Cantonese. y both have a clear L sound. And it’s\nrestricted to the begng  syllables. ""Leng. It’s like ‘pretty.’"" ""La. ‘drag.’"" So the notion that they would switch “fa la la"" to “fa ra ra” is just wrong \nthe makers  a Christmas story should feel bad. Like Korean, Mar  Cantonese don\'t have the dark L sound as  “pull”. But\nwhen they come across an L near the end  a word  english, they tend pronounce it\nmore like a vowel. ""A hundred years old, 90 years old. I said\nwe should respect this kd  people."" ""He chose the coldest possible. Really."" Mar does have an r sound. At the begng  a syllable it sounds like this: ""zrr. zrr.\nSo like actually, maybe the R sounds more like the S  ""treasure."" zrr Rènxìng.” And at the end  a syllable: ""er."" It means ""son."" Cantonese, on the other h, doesn’t have an R sound at all. So when speakg English,\nthey sometimes use a w sound, or an L sound. ""We just tried very hard to prove ourselves."" Our ability to produce sounds  a new language\ndepends  part on whether those sounds are meangfully distct  our first language.\nSo a Japanese speaker hearg lll  rrr  it’s a lot like an English speaker hearg\ntones  Chese. ""Leng. Leng. Leng. Leng."" ""Ma. Ma. Ma. Ma. Yeah I know, people\'s mds\njust blown away."" We all carry the rules  our native language\nwith us when we learn new languages. ""Accent is your identity. So I don’t want\nto sound like an American person or British person."" So if you hear a foreign accent, remember that it’s a unique hybrid, it\'s like a lion with\nstripes — somethg you can only get if you’re brave enough to venture beyond the comfort\n your mother tongue.

Well the briefg has always been problematic sce television came to it.\n presence  the cameras means that there\'s a temptation towards\nselfdramatization  theatrical confrontation sort  for its own sake. A brutal openg statements, let\'s see how Loven deals with that: I would disagree\nwith the notion that it\'s that much more  a spectacle now than it used to be. Wait what? It is a show  it\'s a show for the White House  it\'s a show for\nthe reporters who are sittg  the room. No, it\'s not a doublekill they\'re\nbasically agreeg with each other. Goddamn it you guys. Okay, forget the cage\nmatch thg. DOMINA — I said forget it. So it turns out, nobody really loves the White House\npress conferences.  White House hates them because they have to answer tough\nquestions from reporters ""Are you worried at all that you\'ve lost control  the process on how this bill\'s received?"" And reporters hate them because the White House does\neverythg  its power to avoid answerg those questions. ""I don\'t have an update for you."" ""I don\'t have any formation with which to answer that\nquestion."" ""I appreciate the vitation to get volved  here, but I\'m not gonna RSVP."" y brg out rom guests to stall for time, ""I have two special guests\ntalk to you about a new rulg on labels for cigarettes."" y punt questions to\nother agencies. ""I\'d refer you to the State Department on that."" ""I\'d refer you to HHS."" ""I will refer you to the al Service."" You never really get the big gotcha\nmoments you\'re hopg for.  whole thg is like pullg teeth. Every admistration uses not only the briefg, but every tool at their disposal to go\naround the media. So the briefg is really no different. Tryg to get\nformation from a White House that doesn\'t want to give it to you unless\nthey want to give it to you. se press events became even more  a\nspectacle after Eisenhower troduced\ncameras  1955. ""Motion picture cameras jo newspaper reporters for an historic\npresidential press conference."" Once everyone could watch these thgs on TV, it became much more about puttg on a good show. ""I see we\'re tryg a new experiment\nthis morng. I hope it doesn\'t prove to be a disturbg fluence."" It did. So if nobody\'s really gettg what they want out  these press conferences, why\ndo we pay so much attention to them? Why air them on TV at all? Rosen has a theory. One way we could look at the White House briefg is that it\'s much more  a\nritual act  communication, than it is transmittg formation. Rituals like\nthe White House press conference are tended to show that there is some\naccountability there, that the president has to answer questions, respond to doubts. And this is one way  which American power legitimates itself  \ndemocratic system. You can\'t really see it here, but my bra lit up when he said\nthat because that ritual theory, it kd  makes everythg click. And  ritual, you\'re not tryg to move formation. Instead, you reaffirm values, you\nadvertise the community what it believes . We don\'t care about the press\nconference because it\'s important, it\'s important because we care about it. Because\nthey affirm this idea that the government has to answer to the public.  ideal  the briefg is that you have this operation  which you get a\nchance to ask questions  people who run the most powerful fice  the\nworld. That is accountability  that is important, even if the execution isn\'t\nperfect. Which is why we pay so much attention when the White House clashes\nwith reporters. ""What was it like side that very tense briefg room today?"" To those  us at home it looks like accountability. ""Why were you holdg back\nthis formation? This is directly relevant. Why did you hold it back?""  term that journalists had for this is ""sparrg,"" they loved the idea  sparrg\nwith the ficeholder. y\'re showg how they are the Accountability Police, which is a fascatg image because it suggests boxg, but it\'s\nreally boxg when you\'re practicg, it\'s like playactg  a way. Kd  like wrestlg? Which brgs us back to this: ""That\'s enough. That\'s enough. That\'s. Enough.""  thg about symbolic rituals like this is they only work if everyone agrees\nthey\'re important. If both sides can respect each other enough to keep the\nritual gog. If a pressional wrestler starts tryg to actually murder their\nopponent  the rg, the whole ritual falls apart.  same is true for these\npress conferences. ists don\'t like to talk about this, but there\'s always\nbeen a necessary level  cooperation. Person  power has to agree that is\nimportant to hold me to account. Trump doesn\'t agree with that. ""I called the fake\nnews the enemy  the people  they are. y are the enemy  the people."" His political strategy is built on attackg the press as illegitimate  dangerous,\nbut stead  abong the press conference altogether,\nTrump has transformed it to a platform for stagg high prile fights with the\npress. ""You\'re very rude person.  way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible."" Now the ritual has turned to a ritual  hate.  press has become a hate object  the\nbriefg actually assists  that. For Trump, the pot  the ritual isn\'t\naccountability, it\'s to create an enemy. To give viewers at home a visual  a\nbad guy to root agast. ""See when you talk about division, it\'s people like\nthis that cause division. Great division."" From a PR stpot it\'s a great\nstrategy. Trump can attack the media on Twitter all day, but these press\nconferences turn that anger to a real visceral image, one that gets looped on\nTV screens across the country. ""We also have highlights from the president\'s\nsmackdown  \'s Jim Acosta."" "" president smackg down mastream media\nfor fake news."" ""y\'re very fake news. That\'s right."" I\'m a hundred percent sure he relishes the\nbackforth  understs that with a certa segment  his base, it helps\nhim. Trump has taken other steps to make these press conferences as dramatic as\npossible.  White House is havg fewer press briefgs now than it used to.\nse les represent the number  press briefgs Obama  Bush held\nwhile  fice  this little guy down here is Trump. Which means when the White\nHouse does have a press conference, Trump knows everyone is watchg. ""It\'s very good to have you here, because a free press —"" ""I do too. Actually I do too."" ""It\'s called \'earned media.\' It\'s worth billions, go ahead."" se briefgs are gettg shorter too.  average White House Q&A is\nnow well under 20 mutes, which forces reporters to fight dramatically for\nquestions before time runs out. [Various reporters strugglg to ask questions] is a staple  Hollywood movies  television shows. When you have these confrontations, it\nhelps him cement his support with his core supporters. ""Did you see the sane\ngrstg  the White House press briefg today? He was badgered by some\nmembers  the national leftwg media. I don\'t know how you do your job."" Important underst that  symbolic politics, people not only identify with\nthe leader, but they identify agast the opponent. [Crowd chantg "" sucks.""] Which explas why, despite\nhatg , Trump  Sers keep callg on Acosta press conference after\npress conference. y know he\'ll put on a good show. ""Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you thk, Peter?"" And the\ngenius  Trump strategy is it\'s really temptg to play along. For one, news\nnetwork\'s benefit from the spectacle too. If you\'re not a trump supporter, these\npress conferences still look like a fight between a good guy  a bad guy,\njust with the roles reversed. From the journalist\'s side, theater works by\nportrayg a heroic battler for truth who says ""answer my question, you didn\'t\nanswer the question"" ""President, will you stop callg us the enemy  the people, sir?"" ""Will you stop callg the press the \'enemy  the people,\' sir?"" And that image is also\ndeeply graed  American culture. Which is why  keeps sendg Acosta\n these thgs  fixatg on the White House\'s reaction. It\'s good PR. ""Well, Jake when they go low we keep dog our jobs."" ""That is our job, to ask these\nquestions. We here at  keep dog our job the president should start dog his."" But more than that, it feels good watchg people yell at Trump \nSers when they lie. It\'s cathartic because we want to believe the ritual\nstill works, that the president can still be publicly shamed to tellg the\ntruth. But can he? I thk the most important yardstick we can use to\ndiscover whether these events are still worth it or not is, is the\npresident actually held accountable for anythg? Is he beg more discipled by the confrontation with the facts that\njournalists are tryg to state? If there\'s one thg we can say about the\nTrump admistration, is that this sort  accountability to fact has completely\nfailed. That doesn\'t mean we should abon the press conference altogether.\nre\'s a ton  useful formation reporters get out  these thgs when\nthey\'re not  WWE mode. I mean, I get that it feels like a spectacle when you\nsee the tense parts  it, but there\'s a lot  really prosaic daytoday\nformation gatherg that has to happen on that beat. ""What is the US stance on Venezuela at this pot?"" ""What will be executive order\nthat\'s comg out this afternoon?"" ""Is the president planng on pardong Paul Manafort?"" Tryg to gather a lot , really, just logistical formation about what is gog to happen here  this buildg so we can be prepared to cover it properly. But we should ask if watchg reporters  Trump scream at each other is\nactually that valuable anymore. ""We are awaitg the start  the White House\npress briefg  it should be quite a show."" If it\'s worth givg Trump the\ntitle fight he\'s lookg for. ""I love this, I\'m havg a good time dog it.  public gets it, you know. When I go to rallies, they turn around they start\nscreamg at ."" We can\'t make Trump care about the symbolic value  press conferences, but what we can do is avoid treatg these thgs like a highstakes\nstruggle between a hero  a villa. After all, nothg deflates a wrestlg\nmatch more than one side refusg to take the bait. It\'s borg, it rus the spectacle. And right\nnow, that might be our best option.

142,0.0," movie makeover is you know sort  the\nconvention is boiled down to the girl takes f her glasses  she\'s hot. That\'s Todd Verwerff, .com\'s culture\neditor. We got together to talk about makeover movies. You know the ones. ""Given the right look, the right boyfriend,\nbam,  six weeks she\'s the one beg crowned prom queen."" For all that it gets made fun ,  justifiably\nmade fun , I thk Rachel Leigh Cook sells the makeover sells the makeover  She\'s l\nThat to the degree that I\'m like ""Okay, sure"" nobody noticed that she looked like Rachel\nLeigh Cook until now. One  the very first movies with a makeover\nas its central plotle was a film called Now, Voyager starrg Bette Davis. Charlotte, played by Davis pretty much had\nevery sgle convention you see  makeover movies today. She was shy  nervous, she wore glasses,\nshe had a unibrow  after a brief stt  a sanatorium, she came out lookg like\nreal wner. ""I\'ve lost over 25 pounds it won\'t fit!"" It\'s rooted  Cderella it\'s rooted  any\nstory  the girl or the boy who discovers they are secretly royalty which is a famous\nfairytale convention. ""Me, a prcess? Shut up!"" right, so there are a few thgs that always\nhappen  a makeover movie. 1. You have to establish that the girl or guy\nis visible to the people around them or clumsy or both. 2. You have to fd them a seemgly unattaable\nlove terest. "" Yeah see what\'d I tell you? Hot right?"" 3. ir friends convce them that the only\nway to get out  their shitty situation is a makeover. ""Let\'s do a makeover"" .  big reveal. ""She looks beautiful"" It\'s occasionally been\ngender flipped  you have the guy like does his hair a different way  suddenly everyone\nis like ""Oh wow, what a good lookg guy!"" ""Yes yes, big improvement."" What I thk is terestg about the makeover\nstory is that, at least  past 30 years, we don\'t want it to be that easy. Clueless is perfect for this. ""Sher\'s ma thrill  life is a makeover\nokay it gives her a sense  control  a world full  chaos."" Clueless is based on the Jane Austen novel,\nEmma. It gets at some  her themes  social class\n propriety  what women are allowed to be.  character that who needs the makeover\nbasically is icia Silver Stone\'s character. She doesn\'t realize that until the very end\n like  someways the audience doesn\'t as well. It\'s a marvelously structured movie if you\nlook at it at that level. Let me just do a shout out the recent movie,\n Duff. ""How could you guys not tell me this whole\ntime that I was your ""Duff"" ""Your what?"" ""Your designated ugly fat friend.""  Duff really got understood that Mae Whitman\'s\ncharacter  that movie was not gog to put on a pk prom dress  suddenly be Taylor\nSwift. She was always gog to be kd  the quirky\nfunny girl. ""Are you wearg pajamas?"" ""Oh my God! You know, I get it Wesley! I\'m a disgustg, I\'m a swamp thg, I\'m a\nregular Bela Lugosi!""  makeover was not about becomg someone\nthat was conventionally attractive to dudes,  more about becomg the kd  girl she\nwould be when was a junior  college  had sort  figured her shit out. ""With some tensive work, she\'ll be ready\nfor the world\'s fest trailer park."" Makeover movies aren\'t the most sophisticated\nstories  the world, but it\'s a trope that resonates with people. Teenagers constantly want to hear they\'re\nokay the way they are. That\'s ultimately what the makeover movie\nis about. It\'s about that when you put the glasses back\non  the prom dress comes f, you\'re dressed  your artsy pa spattered overalls, you\'re\nstill a worthwhile person."
143,0.0,"So I was watchg Hannity\'s show a few weeks\nago  somethg really weird happened. It was November 5th  the show was airg from a Trump rally\n Missouri. It\'s election eve. We\'re  the great ShowMe State. How are we all dog? And while Hannity\'s show is always rah rah\nTrump, this one felt especially campaigny. So much is at stake. In a few short hours... you ready? Hannity opened the show by runng through a literal list  Trump\'s accomplishments, cludg gems like ""successful trip to Asia""  ""drafted plan to defeat ISIS."" Well, you gotta to start somewhere. He listed the Democrats agenda if they won\nthe midterms, cludg   course  open borders. He constantly repeated the phrase ""promises made, promises kept."" Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept."" Which, surprise surprise, was one  the GOP\'s\nmidterm slogans. Promises made, promises kept. And he tried to put on a brave face before the impendg Blue Wave. So what are we gog to see tomorrow? I mean, as far as I\'m concerned the polls\nare meangless. y are meangless.  show ended with Hannity privately terviewg\nTrump,  a cf I thk,  askg hardball questions like: ""you spent three  a half billion on the\nborder wall. And I know you\'re disappoted, you want the\nrest."" And that was the end  the show. But the weirdness was only begng. See, a few days earlier, the Trump campaign announced that Hannity would be appearg as a special guest durg\nthe rally. Hannity denied that he\'d appear on stage, claimg he was only gog there to terview\nTrump. But a few mutes after Hannity\'s show fished\nairg... Let\'s get it over with, right? Sean Hannity, come on up. Sean Hannity. Promises made, promises kept. By the way, all those people  the back are\nfake news. That freaked a lot  people out,  not just because Hannity was literally\ncallg other   reporters  the room fake\nnews.   issued a statement sayg they didn\'t condone talent participatg \ncampaign events  Hannity claimed the whole thg with a\ntotal surprise.  president, I had no idea. It was not planned. And then... nothg.  midterms came  went. Hannity went back to his show  that was\nit. Welcome to Hannity. Jam packed hour. What would have been an immediate firg on any other network was barely a PR blip\nfor . Because as shockg as that whole fiasco might\nlook, it\'s just the latest example  how  \nis transformg from a rightwg news network to a full blown campaign operation. You have the power to shock the world aga. Just thk  what it\'s gog to be like to watch the corrupt media. y will lose their mds. I want to start f by sayg this is not\na video about   beg too conservative. It is normal for journalists to have political\nbeliefs. Hannity is obviously a rightwger  I\nam obviously an antifa supersoldier. What\'s not normal is for news organizations to be directly volved  campaigns they\'re\ncoverg. It\'s why you\'ve never seen Rachel Maddow give a stump speech for Democrats. It\'s unethical. so that speech would be 5 mutes long  never get to the pot. Not aga. As an experiment, I asked my bosses if I could\nspeak at a Democratic campaign rally  that I made up because they have too much\nfree time on my hs   here\'s what they said. No. Come on. Of course not. Why not? Because you\'re journalists. You\'re not workg for a campaign. This is a pretty widely accepted rule  journalism  it\'s actually one that   used to\nfollow. In 2010, Hannity spent a week promotg his\nappearance at a Tax Day Tea Party rally  Ccnati. Tax Day, we will be  Ccnati. And hopefully you can be a part  the studio\naudience. But after   found out the rally organizers were usg Hannity\'s appearance to sell tickets, they pulled the plug. Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch said ""I don\'t thk we should be supportg the\nTea Party or any other party."" And that was the last time   pretended\nto give a shit. In 2016, Hannity appeared  a bananas proTrump\ncampaign ad. And  course he\'s gog to build that wall, he says he\'s gog to have Mexico pay for\nit. Sean! You shot it on an iPhone? With a tucked  polo? If any other journalist did that they\'d be\nso ridiculously fired. But   did not fire Hannity. Instead, they said they didn\'t know he was\nappearg  the ad  promised that he wouldn\'t do it aga. And sce then, the problem has exploded. Hannity now regularly appears at an\nfundraisg  campaign events. Here he is campaigng for Ted Cruz  Texas. We need Ted Cruz now than ever. And for Ron Desantis  Florida.  media hates that I\'m here  I\'m like\n""too bad."" But it\'s not even just Hannity anymore. Pete Hegseth, who cohosts   \non the weekend, has repeatedly spoken at GOP fundraisers. Here he is  Washgton  2017. Keep givg. Keep fightg. Don\'t apologize for President Trump. Here he is  Tennessee  April. Please write a bigger check than you thought you were gog to write tonight. He does a ton  these. We are correct. That\'s why you\'re a an. Here\'s  host Laura Ingraham campaigng for an Kelli Ward  Arizona. Let\'s push her over the fish le. Let\'s get it done for Kelli. Right after Hannity got pulled on stage at\nthat Trump rally, another  host, Jeane Pirro, also went\non stage. Get em\' out to vote for Donald Trump  all the people who are runng for the\nan Party. Pirro has bragged about speakg at GOP fundraisers\non TV. Last night, I was  Morgantown, West Virgia where I gave a speech at the annual an\nReagan Dner. She\'s a constant fixture at GOP fundraisers\nacross the country. God, you gotta love that sorority pose, though. I\'m gettg away with it!  problem goes deeper than  hosts appearg at these events. se campaigns are now slowly fectg   programmg. Before Hannity went onstage at that Trump\nrally, he went district by district attackg dividual\nDemocrats. Liberal radical leftist cumbent Claire McCaskill. Radical leftist Democrat Kyrsten Sema. Democratic donothg Schumer Democrat Bill\nNelson. While endorsg an cidates. American hero Martha McSally. Bob Hug. Mare. Semper Fi, Bob. Ted Cruz needs to be back  the U.S. Senate. It wasn\'t the first time he\'d done that. Hannity had been runng that segment for\ndays before the midterms. We will pot out 10 key races a night. So you know if it\'s your district that matters. an Mark Harris, he needs your help. We need that seat to stay an. And aga, it\'s not just Hannity. If you call yourself a conservative  a\nan, it\'s actually immoral not to vote for Donald\nTrump. Vote for the America that is great aga. And the more comfortable  has gotten with\ncampaigng, the more GOP cidates are relyg on  as part  their campaign strategies. Look at this stball terview Hannity did with GOP cidate Kar Housley  October. Kar Housley is with us. Kar, let\'s talk about Keith Ellison \nthe double stard. Yeah. Thank you so much for havg me, Sean. What the That is not a question. That is a campaign stop. And Housley knew it. She immediately repackaged that terview\nto a campaign ad. You can w this race. I believe tha Lots  ans do this now. Clip Hannity\'s stball coverage  repackage it for their campaign. A former police chief, Eddie Edwards. I\'m with the police chief tonight. an challenger Wendy Rogers,  a district that President Trump only carried\nby one pot. By the way good luck  your run for governor\ndown  South Carola. I have a lot  friends down there. It\'s become cliche to mock   as Trump\nTV or state propaga. But what\'s happened over the past few years goes way beyond ideology. Congressman Desantis jos us now. Full disclosure, I did do town halls with\nhim. And I endorsed you  I don\'t regret it.   is quietly allowg itself to evolve\nto a massive, highly fluential getoutthevote operation. Congressman Desantis, congratulations. I remember you  I talkg after we did\nthat debate on    you were like ""you\'re not gog to be behd much longer\nafter this."" And sure enough, I mean, we really pulled\nahead.  problem isn’t that Hannity got on stage\nat a campaign event. It\'s that   is the campaign event. One that\'s becomg deeply embedded  the\nGOP\'s strategy for wng elections from here on out. So let me get this straight. You got an email from Cele Dion\'s presidential\ncampaign  they want you to speak at a rally. At Panera Bread, yes. Carlos!"
144,0.0,"Look at this note. It's from the Blue\nBook Modelg Agency  195. It says Norma Jean, who you might also know as Marilyn Monroe, was  fact, a size 12. LYNN BOORADY: She was. but back  the 50s, a size 12 was very th. That was a model. You know, a size 12 then would be about a size 6 now. Well, to be exact, she would be a size 8 at\nTopshop, 6 at Zara,   to 6 at American Apparel. ..to actually show you the consistencies,\nI went shoppg. I bought 3 jeans at 3 different stores, all\n the same size. We’re already f to a bad start. se all look different. This is not a . This one is the one  the middle. This one fits! Hold up. It won’t zip. I give up. Let’s wd back a little bit. It was the Napoleonic wars  later\nthe Civil War  the US that demed a sizg system for the mass production  clothg for the first time. It was for men’s uniforms. After that, men’s suit sizes were based\non the chest measurement  the rest was calculated accordgly, assumg that their bodies were  proportion.  dems for mass production  uniforms escalated  readymade clothg became really popular. By the end  the neteenth century, most\npeople were wearg readymade clothes. In 1939, the US government funded statisticians\nto collect the weight  58 measurements  15,000 women. LYNN BOORADY: y only used white women, even\nthough they took measurements  women  color, they didn’t clude them  the study\nor the calculations.  women who would’ve turned out for these studies were the poor women because they would be paid. So the data set even back then was possibly malnourished women, certaly poor women,  not very diverse group  women…  that’s what\nwe started with. y were lookg for key measurements that\ncould predict the sizes  other parts  the body, the way chest sizes had for men. But women’s bodies, with variable breast\n hip sizes, were much harder to summarize with a sgle number. So, the data was used to create a\nsystem  1958 with sizes from 8 to 2, an arbitrary number based on bust size, combed\nwith a letter for height  a plus or mus for hips.  sizg chart was really unpopular, so\nthey made some updates, but fally  1983 it was completely withdrawn. In the 1970s  80s, companies started labelg the sizes down,  addg lower numbers like\n2, zero  now even double zero. So the waist measurement that used to be a\nsize 12 became an 8. LYNN BOORADY: Vanity sizg specifically, is when the size on the label is lowered artificially,  order to tempt to get somebody to buy\nthe garment. So you’re appealg to the person’s vanity. Sizg has become a marketg tool. LYNN BOORADY: I thk it’s done because the women are gettg bigger,\nwe’re just addressg that. When the first stardizg chart came out\n 1958 it was mostly built out  malnourished, white women. Now, that there’s such a wide group  people\nto cover, the retailers are pickg a certa group  people to sell to, hong  what\nworks with that group  what doesn’t. LYNN BOORADY: I thk we’re more aimg for our own target markets. So, when Abercrombie & Fitch does their sizg,\nthey’re sizg to their target market not to me. We kept tweakg that formation\nuntil we sold more garments  could lower the return rate. That means, even brs owned by the same company will have consistent sizes. A size 8 at Banana  will have the\nsame hip size as a size 2 at the Gap. So if you get frustrated while shoppg…. LYNN BOORADY: It’s not you, it’s the dustry, it’s not women’s bodies, we’re fe the way we are. y are just rom numbers, they don’t\nmean anythg. And if you don’t like your size just cut\nit out  your clothes."
145,0.0,"This is a chart that has never been seen before. This one hasn’t either nor has this one. None  these have. That because I made them, along with Matt\nhere. My name is Matt Daniels  I'm a journalist\nat the Puddg, which is a publication for visually led storytellg. Well, maly Matt made them, I just sent him\na bunch  emails. se charts are the result  a year long\nobsession I’ve had over a very specific trend I’ve noticed  . Men sgg really high. When I listen to the radio, I’ve come to\nexpect one thg. Male pop stars exploitg their upper register. Bruno Mars,  Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Charlie\nPuth, Just Bieber, Just Timberlake, Adam Lave, the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, Khalid,\nChildish Gambo, Frank Ocean, all  One Direction, BTS, Chris Mart, One ,\n Sam Smith. I’m not the first person to pick up on this. In 2015 alone it seemed every guy was sgg\nhigh. re was Jason Derulo “Just the thought  you, gets me so high\n(so high)” Maroon 5 “I’m right here, cause I need a little\nlove a little sympathy” And Just Bieber “Yeah, I know that I let you down\nIs it too late to say I'm sorry now?” But maybe this fact is best illustrated by\nthis 10 week period on the Billboard Charts. When  Weekend battled for the top spot\nagast Just Bieber “And I know she'll be the death  me” “What do you mean?” And then Himself “I only call you when it's half past five” until fally his Michael Jackson spired\nvoice was was dethroned by Adele’s “Hello.” “Hello, It’s Me” Really the only way to know if this hypothesis\nholds up, though, is to crunch the numbers  quantify it. And that’s where Matt came . It kd  fits a really good mold  the\nquestions that I really like, where we have a cultural question about vocal ranges \nusage  falsetto    there is no perfect data set for that. We wanted to make a chart that showed how\nprevalent the male falsetto was  pop , not just  the last 5 years, but as far back\nas we could go. That meant lookg at  streamg services. Every streamg platform tags the millions\n songs  their respective libraries with metadata, but each one does it a little differently. For example, Spotify has over 35 millions\nsongs  their library, but their metadata is algorithmically driven  pretty broad. Matt: some  it was around the tempo  \n how danceable it was or its somber or positive tone. Pora, on the other h has a smaller library,\nbut they are committed to very specific data. In their case it wasn’t algorithmically\ndriven. y were actually havg humans review songs\n say what its DNA, or what its genome was.  result is a library  2 million songs\nwith up to 50 dividual identifyg markers. So that was terestg to me because falsetto\n vocal range, while could be determed by a computer, ten lends itself to the human\near because there is some subjectivity to it. So, we asked Pora if they had vocal data. y did. And they shared it with us. So do you actually have available the origal\ndataset that we received? Oh yeah yeah I can. Should I just brg that up? It's forty two thous rows.  first entry is by rge P. Watson from\n1911 He was a Yodeler. One hundred  eight years later  2,98\nrows down we have the iconic high voice  Thom Yorke. Sudden words We’ll get to exactly how these are scored\n a bit, but damn that’s a lot  songs. So what we said was “OK this is great to\nsee these forty three thous songs but really we only care about songs that charted.” So we created a data set  the Billboard\nHot 100, a 28,000 song list  the 100 most popular songs  the US every week sce 1958.  we went back to Pora. And said we only really want the falsetto\ndata for these songs,  not only do we want the falsetto data, but we also\nneed data about the register. And a few other important thgs, like the\ngender  the person sgg. It’s not just a matter  like puttg\nto their system  it spits out the falsetto data. We need to match the names  the songs \nthe artists names to whatever Pora has. Wait. So you have to do that manually? We write fancy programs to guess that there's\na match  confirm that there's a match. So with Matt’s fancy program we matched\n20,075 songs. So the biggest gap  the data is actually\nthe missg songs that aren't on streamg services, but were on the Billboard Hot 100\n did have very valid falsetto data behd them. So  1958 we have data for 50%  the songs\nthat charted. In 2018 we have data for 95%  the songs\nthat charted.  good thg though is, you thk  an\naverage number one hit from 1958  that's more likely to appear on Pora than a song\nthat hit number 100 for one week. When I first sat down with this giant spreadsheet,\nI immediately wanted to see how songs that I thought had a lot  falsetto had actually\nbeen scored.  first song that I looked for was Childish\nGambo’s “Redbone.” “If you want it, you can have it, ohhhhhh” His voice is super high  very memorable. Not only that, a lot  articles about this\nsong mentioned it had a lot  falsetto. To my astonishment, Pora determed there\nwas no falsetto  the song, stead they said it was just sung  a high register This trend was most stark  the hard rock\n heavy metal genres. Def Leppard’s “Rock  Ages” had a falsetto\nscore  zero but register score  9 out  10. I don't care if it takes all night\nI gonna set this town alight, come on Knowg this, let’s defe what falsetto\n vocal register actually are. To do that I’ve brought  an actual opera\nsger. Hi I'm Anthony Roth Costanzo  I'm a countertenor\n opera sger. Prove it. Perfect, let’s talk about vocal range first.  voices startg from the bottom  the\nclassical tradition are bass, baritone, tenor, contralto, countertenor, mezzo soprano, Soprano. Countertenor is kd  a catch all term \nit's a range that goes up  down. Most male pop stars today are tenors. That means their average range is somewhere\nbetween here  here. Pora’s data scores vocal register  which\nmeasures a sgers ability to go up  down their range consistently. A super high register Pora rates songs from 010 from low to\nhigh. “Rock  Ages” ranked super high with\na 9  Pharrell’s voice  “Get Lucky” was\ngiven an 8 “I’m up all night to get some, she’s\nup all night for good fun, I’m up all night to get lucky” As was Elton John  “Crocodile Rock” “I never knew me a better time  I guess\nI never will” So I thk it's safe to say that between a\n7  8 is pretty high on the vocal register range. But it's not crazy. So when these artists want to access even\nhigher notes they’ll likely switch to their falsetto register. Falsetto is an Italian word which means “false\nlittle voice.” Falsetto is typically a technique ascribed\nto a male sger that switches from their chest voice to their head voice. Whenever you're gog from chest voice  meang\nthe speakg register  to head voice, there's ten a little break because there are two\ndifferent sets  muscles hg f to each other,  that's how you yodel right. [demonstrates yodelg] And that's what yodelg\nis. rge, you’re back! It’s not just Yodelg. It happens  pop all the time, though that\ntransition is ten more visible. Notice how Freddie Mercury goes from his chest\nvoice to falsetto when he says the word “decle” “A built remedy\nFor Kruschev  Kennedy At anytime an vitation\nYou can't decle” Okay so let me just pause for a second \nsay that “falsetto,” as a term, has been around forever, but its defition has changed \nevolved. Many vocal coaches would say that falsetto\nis that breathy, light sound you heard from Freddie Mercury. And they say the generic term “head voice”\nshould describe crisper, reforced high notes. A perfect example  that is from this 90s\nclassic. “I knew I loved you before I met you. I knew I loved you.” That's amazg. I mean you know that's like a really well\ntegrated strument. For your average  listener, aka me, the\ntechnical distction between head voice  falsetto is less important than the fact that\nthey both just sound impossibly high. That brgs us aga to the scorg system. A 10 on the Pora scale is a song that’s\nsung entirely  Falsetto “Stayg alive” That’s pretty extreme,  accordg to our data set, it’s also pretty\nrare. So here’s the tricky determation I’ve\ngot to make. What falsetto score is enough to really defe\na song. I thk a good place to start is a song literally\ncalled “Falsetto” “Now I got her talkg like this,  a falsetto. She’s like oooh oooh baby ahh ah ah” Pora gave this song a 6   their ears,\nDream only used the technique moderately. This is where I could split hairs all day. Because while, yeah, Dream doesn’t use\na falsetto the whole time, the technique plays does play a central role  the track.  hook  the song, the most memorable part,\nis sung  falsetto. Just Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River”\nalso got a 6. “Cry me a river (go on  just)\nCry me a river (go on  just) Cry me a river (baby, go on  just)” So, I’m gog to look at songs with a falsetto\nabove a 5 If there’s one thg I can’t stress enough,\nit’s that this data can be addressed  a 1,000 different ways. To keep thgs simple, though we’ve separated\nfalsetto  vocal register as two separate data pots. I thk this is probably the first chart I\nmade that just was super simple  just said all right “What is the average value \nall the songs that charted  a year.” First let's focus on vocal register. I was not expectg to see this just a very\nclear like march to the top  the late 80s  average vocal register for male sger\n 1988 was a 7.1. But as you can see across any time period,\nthat average never really dropped below 5.. Because there were so many songs  1988 that\nhad a register  7 or higher, we’re gog to make this a little bit tougher. I’m gog to boost the register to an 8\n only allow songs that made it  the top 10. We’ve got a strong hard rock  heavy metal\nshowg. “She's got a smile it seems to me” re’s my man Phil Colls “I'm always right there beside her\nWe're two hearts” I’ve literally never heard this song “I can rocket 2 u” Okay, wow. If we push the Falsetto score up to a 6, we’re\nleft with just two songs from 1988. “Smooth Crimal”\n“He came to her apartment He left the bloodstas on the carpet”  “Nite  Day” by  B Sure! “I can tell you how I feel about you night\n day” With Nite  Day just barely edgg out to\nw.  1980s blew a high male vocal register\nout  the water. So let’s see how this chart changes when\nwe just focus on falsetto. Thgs start to shift gog back from the\n1980s to the 1970s  the disco era. 1975 was the highest year for falsetto. Where 18%  songs had a value over . It also serves as a turng pot for the\nBee Gees. This might be surprisg to hear, but before\n1975 the Bee Gees’s average falsetto was around 0.8. After 1975 it rose to a 5.5. And that makes sense. y had to compete with the likes  Earth,\nWd,  Fire, Ohio Players, Eddie Kendricks, Curtis Mayfield  all artists whose careers\nwere defed by their high voices. I can image a record executive  a room\nlisteng to a song  they're like “Yeah that's great but you should put some falsetto\n there somewhere” It wasn’t until 1976 that their now trademark\nfalsetto hit number one. “You should be dancg, yeah” Lookg back at both  these charts, it’s\nobvious somethg shifted after the 1980s.  thg that changed after the 80s is you\nhave hip hop becomg massively popular. And today it's the most popular genre. If you look at the average song there just\nisn't as many opportunities for for a falsetto because there's just less sgg. So how do we account for that? So I created this toggle that basically said\nis there sgg  this song which is also from the Pora data, they basically have\na spoken variable. So first let’s see what happens when we\ntoggle the sgg function for songs  the top 10. 1996  2015 really shoot up. Let’s focus on 1996 first. This was the year NeoSeoul went mastream. Artists like D’Angelo  Maxwell led the\ncharge. ir voices were a modern twist on the soul\nartists  the 1970s. I mean just listen to D’Angelo next to Curtis\nMayfield. “When I first saw you baby\nI wanted to die Me  those dream' eyes  me” “So In Love, every time we kiss” 2\n1996 was a huge year for Falsetto, but so was 2015. And here are maybe your your your ears hearg\nthe right thg, relative to other years, 2015 was the year  high voices. Regardless  which toggle we select or which\ncombation  falsetto  register we choose, we did fd this: if a song has falsetto,\nwhether it’s a 1 or a 10, it’s gog to chart higher —  longer. This is true across nearly every year. Not only that, Top 10 Hits are more likely\nto use falsetto. Take a look at that huge spike  2015. 66%  songs that peaked  the top 10 had\nfalsetto. Regardless  the decade, high male voices\nare iconic. From the Frankie Vallie beltg Sherry “Sherry baby” To the 70s swagger  Bloodstone’s “ural\nHigh” “I'm tryg to make somethg out  nothg\nAnd I don't even know you” To the Weeknd’s hazy R&B “None  these toys on lease too, ah\nMade your whole year  a week too, yah” It feels like today is very good for the commercial\nviability  the high male voice. And I thk that's true if the wdow  time is the millennials' lifetime. But if you were to talk to your parents or\nyour parents parents they'd be like Oh you thk today is good. In neteen seventy five it's not even comparable.  reason why it might feel like a trend\ntoday is because this is all we've ever known."
146,0.0,"This is David Hogg. Press secretary for March for Our Lives. He\'s a survivor  the Parkl massacre,  he\'s become one  the most recognizable\nfaces  the movement for gun control. He\'s also probably one  the most vilified\npeople  rightwg media right now. It\'s literally been about six weeks,  I\'m already beg compared to Hitler. Google Hogg\'s name  you\'ll fd sites accusg\nhim  beg a crisis actor, an FBI plant, a brawashed hatemonger, a fascist. I can\'t really even thk  the top five because there\'s about 50 million. If I experienced even a fraction  that, I would collapse to a puddle  soy milk. But rather than crumblg under the pressure, Hogg  his friends have flourished, keepg their cause  the national spotlight while repeatedly dunkg on their critics. So, David,  guy, is it David Hogg? He started f as this balanced, nice kid. He\'s just now become a real bomb thrower. Someone like this I thk isn\'t helpg the\nconversation. To David six weeks ago, I would say get some more cfee  get an external charger. You\'re gog to need it. It\'s kd  hard to believe, but just a few months ago, David Hogg was a typical nerdy high school\nkid. A debater, his school\'s news director, an amateur video producer. And like any good nerd journalist, Hogg knew a bit about the rightwg fever\nswamp. Before all  this, I did know who ex Jones\nwas. I did know who Laura Ingraham was. Well, actually, I didn\'t know who Laura was. But I did know who ex Jones was because  all the sane thgs that he said to the Sy Hook survivors. That background ended up comg  hy. After the Parkl shootg, Hogg  his\nfriends became central figures  the debate over\ngun control. And that made them prime targets for the rightwg smear mache. Forgive me if I don\'t want a lesson on the Second Amendment from a 16yearold. You\'re too immature to carry a firearm, you\'re too immature to make policy. What a conceited, arrogant knowitall. It\'s hard not to just go after this kid. Authoritarianism is always about youth marches. se poor children, they have no soul. Hogg is funded by rge Soros, a literal Nazi collaborator. Honestly, I figured a lot more  our attacks would be agast our policies, not really\nagast me.  most notable  these have been the conspiracy theories. On social media, rightwg conspiracy theories gog viral about David Hogg. Falsely accused survivor David Hogg  beg\na crisis actor. That video was viewed more than 200,000 times before it was taken down. And when I ask Hogg about those, he\'s visibly frustrated. I literally terviewed people  the school durg the shootg thkg I was gog to\nfuckg die. I don\'t know how else to prove to these people that I was there, because I was. This is how the rightwg smear mache works: by bombardg the target with a flood  ridiculous but flammatory personal attacks. Victims can either ignore the smears  risk becomg defed by them, or they can try to respond, burng a ton  time  energy tryg to keep up with each new attack. Either way, the target’s origal message\ngets lost. It\'s like a neverendg game  bullshit\nwhackamole. No matter what I show, it\'s always gog to\nbe, ""Oh, that\'s false."" Or, ""Oh, that..."" It\'s sane. You can see the toll that tryg to keep up with all this stuff has taken on Hogg. But then somethg happens. Hogg catches himself. And for the rest  the terview, he’s\nway more relaxed. y\'ve gone from sayg that I wasn\'t at\nthe school at the time to sayg that I\'m a crisis actor to sayg that I\'m a 27yearold that has\na facelift to sayg that I\'m actually 135 years old\n that I\'m a, like, shapeshiftg lizard, essentially. I mean, I don\'t know about you guys, but last time I checked, gettg a facelift doesn\'t make your actg career any better. So. That moment, that ""breathe,"" is really important. Hogg realizes he\'s gettg caught up  the\nbullshit  decides not to take the bait. I\'m a debate kid,  I\'ve always been made\nfun  throughout my life. I\'m used to it,  a lot  us are too, sadly. Yeah, I feel that. If you contue to pursue whatever path they\'re leadg you down, which is a dead\nend, it\'s gog to end up distractg you  drag your resources,  you don\'t need that. Instead  playg whackamole, the Parkl students have chosen to pick\ntheir battles, engagg their trolls strategically. One  the most notable ways they do this\nis through humor. Some  them called you actors. Well, I am an actor, actually. I’m  Sprg Awakeng right now. We just joke around a lot,  that\'s how we\'re dealg with a lot  this  kd\n copg  some weird way. Look at the Twitter feeds  many  the Parkl\nsurvivors  you\'ll fd them usg humor to respond\nto their critics, turng smears  conspiracy theories to\njokes that get them thouss  retweets. At this pot, it\'s just, it\'s so stupid. It is funny for all  us to witness the ridiculousness\n the situation. Laughg it f is a copg mechanism, for\nsure. But Hogg says it\'s also a good PR move. Laughg it f is great because it keeps\nyou  the news more. Not only do you get a laugh but your followers\nget a laugh,  you get a follow too. Laughg it f also works because it lets students respond to their critics without givg them too much credit. When you\'re laughg, you\'re showg that\nyou don\'t care,  it makes people realize how ridiculous\nthese dividuals are, because they\'re only gog to be taken seriously if you take them seriously. That approach works well when you\'re dealg with frge commentators like ex Jones, people who are already ripe for mockery. I don\'t want to see him kissg gobls. Havg political succubus with gobls. Ingratiatg gobls. But sometimes the troll isn\'t some frge\nperson you can laugh at. Sometimes it\'s the host  a major television\ntalk show, like  \'s Laura Ingraham, who  March decided to mock Hogg on Twitter for gettg turned down by a few colleges. In cases like that, Hogg responds a little\ndifferently. I was actually sittg at dner with my sister,  I was thkg about it for a mute. My friends have responded plenty; maybe I\njust should lay f. And then I\'m like, ""Mmm, I\'m too petty for that."" Hogg responded by tweetg a list  Laura\nIngraham\'s advertisers,  before long, he had tens  thouss\n retweets. What\'s the one thg that\'s common  all\nconflict? Economics. What does Laura care about more than anythg? Her $ million salary. With 2 hours, major advertisers had yanked their ads from Ingraham\'s show. Ingraham publicly apologized "" the spirit\n Holy Week."" And Hogg got another round  earned national media coverage for his cause. What I want to get on from is the negativity\n this situation,  I want to focus on what\'s ahead for our\nmovement. You don\'t need to go after these people personally because that\'s just immature,  that\'s what they\'re tryg to do to you. Go after their advertisers  them makg\nmoney. This is a DavidGoliath story. It appears David has won. Before we ended our terview, I asked Hogg what advice he\'d give to other\nactivists, especially students, who might fd themselves  the crosshairs  the rightwg smear mache. Whenever somebody calls you a dick or whatever, just say, “I love you,” honestly. That\'s what this world needs. We don\'t need anybody else beg super mean\nto each other like Laura was to me or anybody else. Pot out the few that are just absolutely\nridiculous,  after that, people will start fightg\nfor you because you shouldn\'t have to, obviously. Yeah, they shouldn\'t. It is deeply disturbg that teenagers who survived a mass shootg have to worry about how to deal with this stuff. But under the weight  tense media attention\n pressure, these students are puttg on a master class  how to deal with bullies."
147,0.0,"I have to admit that when it comes to food,\nI’m a total sucker. Whether it’s sugar or grease or carbs, pretty\nmuch brg it on! And I spend a lot  time  Montana, so for\nme, that medium rare, grass fed ribeye steak? Pretty much as good as it gets. I know. I don’t do it ten  when I do, I gotta\nadmit I feel a little conflicted. And that’s for a lot  reasons, cludg\nthe planet. But how big  a problem is what I eat? I mean, does it really make much  a dent\n somethg as huge as global warmg? It turns out, what we put on our plates matters\na lot. About 25 percent  all the global climate\nchange problems we’re seeg can be attributed back to the food  the choices that we’re\nactually makg about what we eat on a daily basis. This is greater than all  the cars on the\nplanet. In fact, it’s about twice as much global\nwarmg pollution as the cars. Ben Houlton  Maya maraz study the connection\nbetween climate  diet at the   California, Davis. y track how the way we produce food creates\ngreenhouse gases that contribute to global warmg. With their data, the team has crunched the\nnumbers to figure out how much carbon pollution is produced by different foods  different\ndiets. A lot  people feel really helpless when\nit comes to climate change, like they can’t make a difference. And what our research is showg is that your\npersonal decisions really can have a big impact. So, take that grass fed ribeye steak I love. If you really look at everythg that went\nto makg a sgle servg  beef, you end up emittg about 330 grams  carbon. That’s like drivg a car three miles. Now, if I choose to have chicken stead,\nthere’s more than a fivefold drop  emissions. Switch to fish  you see the number go down\neven more. Now, look at veggies. If I swapped beef out entirely for lentils,\nwell, I’m down to practically nothg! So, why does beef  lamb, too, for that\nmatter  pack such a powerful punch to the planet? Livestock accounts for a little over 1 percent\n global greenhouse gas emissions. If that sort  seems low to you, consider\nit’s about equal to transportation. We’re talkg all the cars, trucks, planes,\ntras  ships on the planet combed! This is partly because rumant animals like\ncows  sheep  they’re just gassy! And the methane they produce is at least 25\ntimes more potent than carbon dioxide. Plus it takes lot  l, fertilizer \nabout a billion tons  gra to feed all that livestock. And you could feed 3.5 billion people with\nthat gra; if we were just directly eatg these gras ourselves, it would elimate\na lot  the CO2 that is emitted from cattle production. So it’s clear that meat has a pretty big\ncarbon load, but it’s also worth rememberg that not all livestock is raised equally. In parts  the American West, for stance,\nranchers are workg to raise livestock  ways that actually help restore the l. And they’re experimentg with ways that\nsoil  grassls can be used to keep carbon pollution out  the air. But even these sustaable ranchers will really\ntell you, we’re probably eatg too much meat. I know a lot  people who if you don’t\nserve them meat for lunch or dner, they’re kd  like ""well, when is the meat comg out?"" It\'s to the pot now where the U.S. actually\nhas one  the highest meat footprts per capita. So, what about not eatg meat at all? Vegan is the way to go for the least impact\non the planet, but it’s not that much different,  terms  emissions, than say, a vegetarian\ndiet. And the team found that the environmental\nimpact  the Mediterranean diet is pretty similar to vegan  vegetarian diets. It’s a lot less meatheavy than what Americans\nare used to  so, fish  poultry a few times a week; beef maybe once a month, plenty \nplantbased foods,   course, loads  olive oil. Elimatg like 90 percent  your meat take\nis more important than elimatg all  your meat. We don’t all have to be vegan. We don’t all even have to be vegetarian. If we can just reduce our meat take, every\nlittle bit helps. And if you can brg it down a lot, you can\nhelp the climate a lot. If we all just switched to a Mediterranean\ndiet, it could actually solve 15 percent  global warmg pollution by 2050. If everyone were to move towards it, that\nis equivalent to takg somewhere around a billion cars f  the streets,  terms\n vehicle emissions each year. So, that kd  a footprt is bigtime. But say you still want more meat than the\nMediterranean diet recommends? Just cuttg down your portion size to the\ndoctorrecommended  ounces can reduce your emissions by half. That’s huge! In fact, the doctors are tellg us we’re\neatg about twice as much meat as we really need for a healthy diet.  good news is, we are listeng to our\ndoctors. In the last decade, there’s been a 19 percent\ndrop  the amount  beef we eat. l these thgs that you\'re already beg\ntold are good for you also happen to be good for the planet. So what we eat really is a big part  the\nclimate puzzle. I mean, we may not all be able to afford an\nelectric car or puttg solar panels on our house, but we all have to eat every day. And these choices we make can add up to really\nbig numbers. And sce meat has a pretty big carbon load,\nwe need to be thoughtful about how much we eat. As for that ribeye steak that I really love,\nI am honestly tryg to cut back! Maybe it’s just a smaller piece  steak;\nor simply swappg out a meat dish for a veggie burger. It may seem like a small thg, but it really\ndoes add up to big impacts. Hey, so what did you have for dner last\nnight?

148,0.0,"A few weeks ago, I terviewed one  my favorite\nrappers, Open Mike Eagle. And immediately we started geekg out over the masked emcee,\nMF Doom. His flow I have to be careful with his flow\nbecause his flow lives  my md   my heart. I can almost get to his md on how\nhe writes. You know? This is what MF Doom sounds like. Just listen. He’ll have entire bars that rhyme. Like\nthe entire set up bar rhymes with every syllable  the punchle bar. It’s credible. It made me wonder: What can I learn from rappers simply by lookg\nat how they rhyme with the beat? I try to start f with 16 dots on the paper. That’s Rakim. He’s widely regarded as\none  the most fluential MCs  all time. If  bars was this long. I see like a graph\nbetween them four bars. I could place so many words  so many syllables. I could take\nit to the pot where there were no other words you could put  those  bars. So, before we get to rhymes we need to know\nwhat beats  bars are. Mart: I always try to fd the beat  the\n first. That’s Mart Connor. He’s analyzed the\nmost rhythmically dense rap songs down to the last syllable. And he writes about it. Mart: A bar is a groupg together  \nbeats. Before guys like Rakim came along, rhymes\n rap songs were pretty basic. Take one  the first commercially successful\nrap songs from 1980, “ Breaks” by Kurtis Blow This simple AA BB rhymg pattern with no\nword play or puns is pretty predictable, lyrically  ally But, fast forward to 1986  you’ve got\nsongs like “Eric B. Is President” from Eric B. & Rakim. Compare this to “ Breaks”  it’s\nclear the frequency  rhymes is greater. But not only are you seeg more rhymes you’re\nalso startg to see different kds  rhymes. “Indeed”  “Proceed” are ternal\nrhymes because they happen side the sentence. “Man made a mix”  “baid to fix”\nare multisyllable rhymes  other thg Rakim does later  the verse\nis cross the bar le  he does it  a tremendously clever way. Crossg the bar le happens when a sentence\nlike “ rhyme can’t be kept side” doesn’t end when the bar ends. If you listen closely you’ll hear that the\nsecond syllable  SIDE Ls on the first beat  the next bar. Rakim even references this  the lyric. And\nit’s pretty clever. Now, fast forward 11 years  Notorious B.I.G\'s\n“Hypnotize"" cleverly used Rakim’s techniques to make one  the smoothest rap songs ever. Mart: What I like most about this is that\nit’s not predictable  it’s always changg. So sometimes Notorious B.I.G.s sentences are\nlong. Sometimes they’re short. Like the moment  this verse here: He’s also completely comfortable deliverg\na sentence across the barle. But, what makes this song st out the most to me\nis that before one rhyme scheme ends, another one begs. Like this moment  verse 2.  first group  rhymes is the “oo”\nrhymes  it lks the first  second sentence which then begs the “ih”  so on. It’s a huge reason gie sounds so smooth\nhere. Now, as much as gie daisy chaed an entire\nsong together with rhymes, he was, for the most part usg sgle syllable  sgle\nword rhymes. And this is where artists like Mos Def push\nthgs even further. His verse on “Re:Defition” from 2002\nhits nearly every note with the bar with  syllable rhymes. And he does it across a whoppg 1 bars. In Re:Defition, Mos Def is very clearly\nrhymg each word with the beat. This is where Andre 3000 shakes thgs up\nwith his verse  Aquemi.  on the beat first. Now listen to each syllable, with the beat  md. Most rappers would have dollars, parlors,\n bottles all rhyme similarly on the beat. But Andre is accentg each rhyme with different\nplaces relative to the beat  bar. People say that the word orange doesn\'t rhyme with anythg. \nAnd that kda pisses me f because I can thk  a lot  thgs that rhyme with orange... In fact, Emem, does this exact thg on\nhis 2002 song “” Emem doesn’t just pack  tremendously\ndense multi syllable rhymes, he also tells credibly vivid stories. And for a lot  people that ws  a battle. This is where “Lose Yourself” comes .\nIt was the first rap song to w an Academy Award. Whew the Oscar goes to Emem, for Lose Yourself\nfrom 8 Mile. Mart: I’ll see the le  I’ll separate it all to not just words or sentences, but to their syllables. When you group all  these rhymes together,\nthis credibly complex rhyme scheme emerges. It’s unpredictable, it’s complex rhythmically\n lyrically but  It’s not just that you’re rhymg, \nIt’s that while you’re rhymg you’re still tellg a good story. And ""Lose Yourself"" is like that. Today, rappers like Kendrick Lamar are carryg on the tradition  artists \nthat are able to use the ality  rhymes to create really memorable songs. Let’s look at Kendrick Lamar’s “Rigamortus”  first thg you’ll notice is that Kendrick\nhas created a very clear motive with his rhymes. What’s a motive? It’s a short al\nidea. A al fragment or succession  notes that has some special importance \na composition. Here’s probably the most recognizable motive\n the history  . That “du du du dummmmm” is carried out\nthrough the entire piece. It’s 3 quick notes followed by a long note.  al motive  “Rigamortus” is\ntwo short notes followed by a long note, strgg the entire\nsong together. When Kendrick goes to th gear he\nkeeps the motive gog. And the motive keeps him  check. As much as gie’s “Hypnotize” sounds\ncompletely different from “Rigamortus” there are a lot  al similarities. Remember how gie daisy chaed rhymes?\nKendrick does that too here. In “Hypnotize” gie also creates a motive with the sequence\n rhymes here: Now, let’s get back to MF Doom. Two years\nafter “Lose Yourself” won an Academy Award, MF Doom released 3 full albums cludg Madvillay  which is widely considered one\n the best underground hip hop records period. Mos Def can’t even conta his excitement\ntalkg about Doom. For the most part, MF Doom rhymes on the beat\nbut he uses multi syllable rhymg phrases up with wazoo ten rhymg entire les together. This is called a holorime. Mike: He’ll do setup punchle. Like his\nfollowg bar will be referencg the punchle but not  a way that he’ll be settg up\na another one, he just starts to go  another direction, but just acknowledges where the last bar was. This is what Mike is talkg about. MF Doom understs the power  rhyme \nthe beat  completely manipulates it  a humorous way. As Pitchfork pots out “the rhyme\'s pattern\n rap\'s topical stereotype dems the word ""bitches,"" yet Doom hilariously says ""booze""\n uses that rhyme to connect the next sentence. Where artists like Kendrick Lamar, Emem,\n Andre 3000 are tellg very vivid stories with their rhymes, MF Doom is usg his dense\nrhymes like a villa would use his superpower. Before you know it you’re beg hit with\na killer punchle, double entendres,  clever wordplay. Mart: I love rappers with that  syncopated uneven phrasg where the sentences don\'t le up with the bars because, like you said, you can\'t predict what\'s gog to happen.  pot  appreciatg it is to see what the very most clever human begs are capable  dog that you didn\'t thk possible."
149,0.0,"Aretha Frankl is the Queen  Soul  she\nnot only embodied the spirit  Soul  her  but she lived it. Because, very simply, she doesn\'t sg soul — she is soul. Soul is rooted  gospel, a genre  \nthat combes rhythm  blues with church hymns. Aretha was exposed to those sounds her entire\nchildhood. She was raised  the church where her father,\nCL Frankl, was the most well known preacher  the US durg the golden age  gospel\n the 190s  50s. You could hear any one  Aretha’s hits\n witness a master class  the power  gospel , but it’s her covers  her\nlive performances that really reveal all the gospel techniques she had at her disposal. Aretha could turn any song to a gospel song. Just take a look at these two tracks.  top is British soul sger, Dusty Sprgfield’s,\nmost iconic song “Son  a Preacher Man” Dusty  Aretha shared the same producer,\nJerry Wexler at Atlantic Records.  song first went to Aretha, who ended up\npassg on it. Dusty took it,   early 1969 her version\nrose to the top  the charts. A year later, Aretha released a cover  it\n it sounded completely different. Where Dusty started with a smooth electric\nguitar riff, Aretha started on the piano. An strument\nthat, along with the hammond organ, played a central role \n the sound  gospel   her career.  fgers  the voice are all part  that same tradition. And she was traed by the best. Aretha comes up durg the golden era  gospel   actually her piano teacher is the late Rever James Clevel, who became kg  gospel. Here he is, backg her on the piano. Aretha sat behd a piano her whole career\n at any pot she could speed up or slow down, creatg a spectrum  emotional moments. Like this moment here: re\'s an old sayg  the black church: This valley is there to build to that fal\nclimactic moment  the song. In gospel  it’s ten called the “special\nchorus” or vamp.  vamp is almost like\nyou take the essence  the song. the most memorable rhythmic piece is repeated\nover  over. Clara Ward  the Ward Sgers, Aretha Frankl’s\nbiggest mentors, perfected this  their gospel recordg  “Packg Up” This key component  gospel was everywhere\n the   the 1960s. Listen to the Rollg Stones imitate those high notes \nMarion Williams  “Sympathy for the Devil.” Aretha carried that gospel tradition  repetition\n vocal improvisation over to her  too. In this recordg she improvises over her backup vocal group, the Sweet Inspirations. I thk  the case  the preacher man they were even\nsayg literally Hallelujah. You know, right on the top  the groove.  same sgers were on Dusty\'s version too. But their voicg on Aretha\'s recordg is completely different. One  the most excitg differences is when they echo “Sock it to me” a phrase they also sg\n “Respect”. y added ""sock it to me"" to that, it became like a thg. [Repeatg ""Sock it to me""] Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to me. Sock it to yourself. Sock it to me? Sock it to me. Lay it on me. Give me a high five. Know what I\'m say\'? Was that nocent, or.. cocidental? Now what did you thk it meant? Well, you\'d come home  give me my propers. Son  a Preacher Man lives on vyl as a\nstudio recordg, but Aretha’s gospel roots really she when she’s playg live. Take her performance  “Dr. Feelgood,""\nlive at Fillmore West  San Francisco. In a 1971 review, Ebony magaze\nsaid “ album captures the spirit  her person performances that are never merely\nshows but more rituals  an almost religious nature."" This  has to be spired  the moment. re’s always a sgle moment  every\nsgle one  her live performances where the crowd erupts. In Dr. Feelgood it happens about 2 mutes\n  almost the endg  the song. [ Aretha Franklg performg live at the Fillmore West  San Francisco] [Cheers  shoutg eruptg from the audience.] [Aretha Frankl contues sgg."" She can literally control the crowd when she\'s\nat that moment  the song. This is a blues song, but at this moment she’s\nprimg people for a spiritual awakeng. At the very end, where she just starts to kd  talk to the crowd,  she said you want to sit\ndown  cross your arms  crossed her legs  look up to heaven. So she\'s now talkg about ecstasy but she\'s\nsgg about it  a way that\'s very spiritual  sacred. You know, she’s usg gospel to\nget us there. [Aretha Frankl teractg with the crowd at the Fillmore West.] She habits these songs to a degree that we\'re not used to seeg much anymore, that naked vulnerability. It\'s comg from a church tradition. You may only have an audience  10, but you may have been put\nthere to reach one person. It was very rare that a gospel sger could\ngo back  forth between gospel  pop so freely, but Aretha’s voice  authenticity\ntranscended genres. So this is 1971  if anyone  gospel as a performer\nwould have done that, it would have been controversial. Somehow Aretha was able to bounce back  forth  stay, to the end, true to both worlds."
150,0.0,"This might be the most important chart for understg American politics. It shows the ideology  both parties  Congress over the past few decades. Researchers looked at every politician\'s votg\nrecord  then gave them a score based on how extreme or moderate they were. And if you look at the past 0 years, somethg dramatic has happened. Both parties have moved away from the center, but ans  Congress have moved much further than Democrats have. That difference is even more jarrg if you look at the past few presidents. an presidents have become more  more conservative over the past few\ndecades while Democrats have stayed fairly consistent. Political scientists have a name for this. y call it asymmetrical polarization. It\'s one  the most important trends  recent\nAmerican politics. But it\'s also one  the hardest to talk about. And that\'s posg a big challenge for journalists who want to stay neutral while coverg a\nparty that\'s creasgly gog f the rails. This is not the an Party that any\n us recognize. This is not the an Party I joed\n0 years ago. What happened to the an Party? I\'ve been askg myself that question. It\'s soul crushg for me. Let\'s just address the soy boy  the room. I am not a great person to be makg this\nargument. I\'m a queer, treehuggg atheist with immigrant\nparents. Me criticizg ans is about as shockg as  havg marimbas  the background \na video. So I brought some backup. I\'m Norm Ornste. I\'m a political scientist. I\'ve been thktankg it for longer than most  the people watchg this have been\nalive. Norm Ornste is kd  a legend. He\'s spent the past four decades writg about Congress  American politics. He\'s been named one  the Top 100 \ners. I used to w debate competitions  high\nschool usg articles that Ornste wrote. A fun fact that he did not fd to be that\nfun. Most  Ornste\'s work has focused on how to make sure that Congress stays functional. I worked very closely with a lot  Democrats  with a lot  ans. In all the years that I wrote about Congress, I was very, very careful to be not a partisan. But if you look at the titles  Ornste\'s\nbooks, you can see a quiet transformation happeng. It starts f normal enough. Congress  Change: Evolution  Reform Campaign Fance: An Illustrated Guide n it gets a little darker.  Permanent Campaign  Its Future  Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failg\nAmerica And then,  2012, Ornste  his writg\npartner Thomas Mann write this book: It\'s Even Worse Than It Looks: How  American Constitutional System Collided With  New   Extremism. In it, they write: "" an Party is\nan surgent outlier. It has become ideologically extreme, scornful  compromise,  dismissive \nthe legitimacy  its political opposition.  Democratic Party, while no paragon \nvirtue, is more open to cremental changes fashioned through bargag with the ans. This asymmetry constitutes a huge obstacle to effective governance."" Holy sh. Tom Mann  I came to the conclusion that we couldn\'t sugarcoat this anymore.  fact is that Congress changed. Ornste\'s critique  the modern GOP falls to two major categories: their goals  their methods. re\'s no question that the an Party\'s\ngoals have become more extreme over the past few\nyears. In 2006, rge Bush was talkg about immigration\nlike this: re is a rational middle ground between grantg an automatic path to citizenship  a program  mass deportation. Compare that to Donald Trump: You\'re gog to have a deportation force. In 1970, a an president created the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate\npollution. se problems will not st still for politics or for partisanship. Now, ans campaign on abolishg that\nsame agency. We are gog to end the EPA trusion to\nyour lives. Even the an obsession with tax cuts is a relatively new phenomenon. Reagan is worshipped as a tax hawk now, but he actually raised taxes 11 times durg\nhis presidency. Do you thk the millionaire ought to pay\nmore  taxes than the bus driver or less? More! Ronald Reagan, welcome to the resistance? On its own, that ideological shift isn\'t a\nhuge problem as long as the two parties still work together. Our political parties are supposed to view\nthe other side as adversaries who may view the world differently, but we can work with them. And that\'s where Ornste\'s second critique\ncomes . About ans methods.  way they pursue their policy goals. Over the past few decades, ans have\ngotten less  less willg to work with Democrats\non anythg. This chart shows how ten the filibuster\nwas used to block a vote  the Senate. When ans aren\'t  power, they\'re more willg to stop Democrats from gettg anythg done. And you can really see it escalate after Obama ws the presidency  ’08. That year, Democrats won both houses  Congress. And  a normal world, ans would have taken the L, reworked their campaign strategy,  focused on the next election. Instead, Mitch McConnell came out  said\nthis: Our top political priority over the next two\nyears should be to deny President Obama a second\nterm. Cool beans. And it wasn\'t just McConnell. In a private meetg before Obama\'s auguration, leadg ans reportedly agreed, ""If you act like you\'re the mority, you\'re gog to stay  the mority. We\'ve got to challenge them on every sgle\nbill  challenge them on every sgle campaign."" And they did. In 2011, ans held the debt ceilg\nhostage, threateng to let the country default if the Democratic majority didn\'t agree to major cuts  Medicare  Social Security. As long as this president is  the Oval Office, a real solution is probably unattaable. In 2013, they actually shut the government\ndown tryg to force Obama to defund Obamacare. That was a remarkable victory to see the House engage  a prile  courage. A lot  this obstruction wasn\'t even ideological. Some  it was ""no"" for the sake  ""no."" In 2016, ans rejected Obama\'s budget before they even saw what was  it. And then,  course, there\'s Merrick Garl. ans flat out refused to meet with Obama\'s Supreme Court nomee for months. Not because he was too liberal. Garl was objectively a centrist. But because they wanted a an to fill\nthe seat. We don\'t tend to take up a nomee. You ever watch someone\'s soul wither away\nmidsentence?  thg is, if Hillary had won the election, many ans said they would have kept the seat open permanently, preferrg to have an complete Supreme Court than let a Democrat appot a justice. That is not normal behavior by party leaders. And it is a reflection  a strategy designed to divide Americans  use your leverage to hold power even if you are not a majority\n the country. Regardless  how you feel about tax cuts\nor Obamacare, this mywayorthehighway approach is bad\nfor democracy. And Ornste\'s book was his attempt to get\nneutral observers, cludg journalists, to admit that. And it really is a party that I would say\nhas gone rogue. And I don\'t say that as a partisan. It is a fact  life. An unfortunate one for the country.  problem is admittg that fact makes you sound like a liberal hack. And if you look at the comments on this video, you know exactly what I mean. Talkg about asymmetric polarization, by defition, means you treat the two parties differently. And that means beg accused  liberal bias. This is tough for media to do. Tough because you get caught  the crosshairs. It\'s tough because you can lose viewers or\nlisteners. So stead, many networks have framed political\nfights as just bitter disputes between two parties\nthat can\'t get along. A stalemate now exists as both sides dig \ntheir heels. Both sides blamg one another for this impasse. Both sides playg politics. You saw it durg the 2013 government shutdown. ans literally held the government\nhostage to underme Obamacare. But stead  potg that out, a lot  coverage blamed both sides for not\ncompromisg. With both sides diggg , we are now \nuncharted territory. Both sides refuse to budge. Washgton is a dysfunctional town  there\'s plenty  blame to go around on\nboth sides. Obama went out  his way to avoid that framg. I want every American to underst why it\ndid happen. y demed ransom just for dog their\njob. But the media\'s affity for that ""both sides""\nframe meant that even those comments got criticized. President Obama playg the blame game. Playg the blame game.  blame game contues. This kd  kneejerk neutrality makes it really hard to underst who\'s responsible for breakg our politics. If you are monomaniacal  pursuit  both\nsides, you ignore a reality where there may be one\nside. And the scary thg about asymmetrical polarization is that it forces the other party to play\nhardball too. When ans refused to vote on a huge number  Obama\'s judicial appotees, Democrats changed the rules. Democrats voted to lower the threshold to\nbreak a filibuster from 60 votes to 51 votes. It\'s time to change the Senate before this\nstitution becomes obsolete. It was a bad but necessary response to an\nunusual situation. One created by ans. But that decision to change the rules has haunted Democrats for years. As tensions flared over Brett Kavanaugh\'s nomation to the Supreme Court, ’s Kasie Hunt blamed Democrats for\nstartg the problem. You know there\'s a lot  people you can blame\nfor that. Started with the Democrats  Harry Reid when he took away the filibuster for those\ncircuit court judges  it got lower when Mitch McConnell did\nit for the Supreme Court. Ornste actually got to a Twitter fight\nwith Hunt over that comment, writg, I know the desire to show you are balanced. But the truth is not always balance. And equatg Reid — who is no angel — with McConnell, who blew up more norms \npractices  the Senate than all other leaders before\nhim combed, is just wrong. Damn Norm. This problem is likely to get worse as time\ngoes on.  more ans move to the extreme, the more Democrats are gog to seem obstructionist\n response. Look at this filibuster graph aga. Every time ans raise the stakes, Democrats react by matchg them. That\'s gog to make it really temptg to\nsay, “Both sides are equally bad.” Guess what the Democrats are dog. Punchg back, tit for tat. Neither side here has clean hs. re seem to be no grownups  charge. And what that does is it means that people who behave badly get f the hook. Nobody blames them for it. And it\'s easy for them to say, ""Hey, the other side is worse.""  only way to discourage this kd  normbreakg\nbehavior is to be really clear about who\'s causg\nit. And that\'s gog to require journalists to\nbe brutally honest about what\'s happeng to the an Party. It doesn\'t mean that you all become tribal\nadvocates. It means that you call out people who are\nviolatg norms or who are behavg  a corrupt fashion. But if you don\'t do that, then you\'re not\ndog what you\'re supposed to do as a vital part\n a free society. Some  the worst thgs have been said about me over the years have been said by\nNorm Ornste. One thg we agree on. Some  the worst thgs that have been said\nabout me have been said by you."
151,0.0,"We have this idea that if we want to lose\nweight, we jo a gym on January 1st, we start workg out regularly,  eventually we’ll\nslim down. Well, here’s some bad news.\nI read more than sixty studies on this,  it turns out exercise is actually pretty useless\nwhen it comes to weight loss. Dr. Kev Hall at the ional Institutes  Health has done some  the most important studies on exercise  weight loss\nWe need to rebr exercise … exercise isn’t a weight loss tool per se, it's excellent\nfor health is probably the best sgle thg that you can do other than stoppg smokg\nto improve your health. But don’t look at it as a weight loss tool.\nExercise will defitely help you live a longer, happier life…. It’s just not the best\nway to lose weight. And the reason has to do with how our bodies use energy.\nYou may not realize it, but physical activity is actually a ty component  your daily\nenergy burn. re are three ma ways our bodies burn\ncalories. se clude your restg metabolism, so\nthat's how much energy your body burns just for its basic functiong, just to keep you\nalive, basically.  other part  energy expenditure is the\nthermic effect  food,  that’s just how much energy is required to break food\ndown  your body.  third part  energy expenditure is physical\nactivity. For most people, physical activity  that’s\nany movement you do, only accounts for about 10 to 30 percent  energy use.\nSo the vast majority  energy or calories you burn every day comes from your basal or\nrestg metabolism, over which you have very little control.\nWhile 100%  your “calories ” are up to you, only up to about 30%  your “calories\nout” are  your control. One study found that if a 200pound man ran\nfor an hour,  days a week for a month, he’d lose about 5 pounds at most, assumg everythg\nelse stays the same. And everythg else doesn’t stay the same!\nResearchers have found we make all kds  behavioral  physiological adaptations when\nwe start creasg the amount  exercise we’re gettg every day.\nFor one thg, exercise tends to make people hungry.\nAnd I'm sure you know the feelg: you go for a spng class  the morng, \nthen by the time you eat breakfast you're so hungry you maybe double the size  the\nportion  oatmeal you normally eat. re's also evidence to suggest that some\npeople simply slow down after a work out, so if you went runng  the morng you\nmight be less cled to take the stairs at work.\nse are called “compensatory behaviors”  the various ways we unknowgly underme\nour workouts. Researchers have also discovered a phenomenon\ncalled metabolic compensation. As people start to slim down, their restg metabolism can slow down. So the amount  energy you burn while at rest is lower. That means this bar might shrk as you start to lose weight. re’s still a lot  research to be done,\nbut one study from 2012 is particularly terestg. y went out to the middle  the Savannah\n Tanzania to measure the energy burn among a group  hunter gathers called the Hadza.\nse are superactive, lean huntergatherers. y’re not spendg their days behd a computer at a desk. And what they found was shockg. What we found is that there was no difference at all. So even though the Hadza have a much more physically active lifestyle, they weren't burng any more calories every day than adults  the US  Europe.\nSomehow the energy they used for physical activity was beg fset or conserved elsewhere.\nSo how do they stay slim? y don’t overeat. We can undo the calories that we burn f  exercise pretty quickly. It would take about an hour  runng to burn f a  Mac  fries. You’d have to spend about an hour dancg\npretty vigorously to burn f three glasses  we you might drk with dner.\nAn hour  cyclg really tensely on exercise bikes to burn f about two doughnuts.\nThat’s why exercise is best seen as a healthy supplement for a strategy that’s focused\non food. But despite extremely high obesity rates \nthe US, government agencies contue to present exercise as a solution\n... as do companies with a real terest  makg sure we keep eatg  drkg their\nproducts. Sce the 1920s, companies like CocaCola\nhave been aligng themselves with the exercise message.\n idea here is that you can drk all these extra bottles  soda as long as you work\nout. But as we're seeg, it doesn't work like that. Actually burng f those extra calories from a can  soda is really, really hard. We have an obesity problem  this country,  we shouldn't treat low physical activity   eatg too many calories as equally responsible for it. Public health policymakers should really prioritize improvg our food environment to help people make healthier choices about what they eat. It's not impossible to lose weight through exercise, it's just a lot harder. And we need to recognize how that works. If you do go to the gym,  you burn all these calories, it takes you a long time to do so  you put  a great amount  effort, you can erase all  that  five mutes  eatg a slice  pizza. Relative magnitude is actually quite surprisg,  most people don't fully appreciate that."
152,0.0,"This is Fiery Cross isl. It\'s a little more than one square mile  size  it\'s home to a Chese military base. re\'s a 10,000 foot airstrip, an advanced radar station, a missile defense system,  about 200 troops. But the strangest thg about Fiery Cross Isl is that two years ago, it didn\'t exist. And neither did the six other Chese military bases that have been built on manmade isls  the South  Sea. If you look at this satellite image from 201, you can see huge Chese ships collectg around remote reefs  the Spratly Isls. An archipelago  the South  Sea. In this image, these ships are rapidly pumpg s  rock up onto the reef. y\'re buildg isls. And less than a year later, the Chese had seaports air bases  buildgs on their new isls  the world had taken notice. We contue our look this morng on what  does not want you to see the superpower is reclaimg l  seven spots  the South  Sea addg on average more than threeahalf acres everyday. With these isls times tryg to lay claim to one  the most important areas  ocean  the world the South  Sea.  South  Sea is credibly rich  natural resources 11 billion barrels  oil, 190 trillion cubic feet  natural gas  ten percent  the world\'s fisheries. Most importantly though, 30%  the world\'s shippg trade flows through here to the boomg population centers  economic markets  Southeast Asia. It\'s an extremely important body  water  right now five countries lay claim to some part  it. Now, most countries base their claim f the UN Law  the Seas, which says a country\'s territorial waters extend 200 miles f their shore. An area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Countries have exclusive rights to all the resources  trade  there EEZ. It\'s their sovereign territory. So for example, any oil that\'s found with 200 miles f the coast  Vietnam belongs exclusively to Vietnam. But any area that isn\'t  an EEZ is regarded as ternational waters  it falls under UN maritime law which means everybody shares it. Now, every country  the South  Sea region uses this 200mile EEZ threshold to determe its claims. l except .  argued they have a historical claim to the South  Sea datg back to naval expeditions  the 15th century. And they mark it usg a really confusg border called the nedash le. Followg  War II, Japan who had domated the entire region, lost all control  its surroundg seas.  used the moment to claim the South  Sea by drawg this imprecise le on the map that encompassed nety percent  the South  Sea. It became known as the nedash le. When the UN established the 200mile EEZ  1973  stuck to its own le, refusg to clarify its boundaries  ignorg claims by other countries. Now that brgs us to the Spratly Isls. It\'s a remote barely habited cluster  isls currently claimed by , Vietnam, the Philippes,  Malaysia.  Spratlys are both geographically  symbolically at the heart  South  Sea. That\'s because any country that can claim the Spratly isls can extend their EEZs to clude them  ga exclusive rights to the surroundg territory. But it\'s really hard to legitimately claim unhabited piles  s so a few nations have built small buildgs  ports on their claimed isls  even stuck a few people there. But  believes all the Spratly Isls belong to them which brgs us back to why they\'re buildg isls there. Installg military bases on these new artificial isls took the dispute to a whole new level showg how \'s potentially willg to defend its claims with force. Now this is about when the United States took notice. While the US has no claim  the South  Sea, it is the world\'s lone superpower  uses its massive Navy to defend ternational waters.  sees the US presence  the area as an encroachment  their backyard. When a US destroyer ship sailed just 12 miles f the shore  one  \'s manmade isls  the Spratlys  sent out their own destroyer  a patrol boat as a warng.  is buildg these isls  order to crease control around the surroundg waters. Usg a strategy that they\'ve deemed "" Cabbage Strategy"". Where they surround a contested isl with as many ships as possible. In May  2013  sent several ships to Ayung shoal, which is just 105 nautical miles f the coast  the Philippes, well with that 200 mile EEZ.  Philippes has eight soldiers stationed there. Like wrappg leaves around a cabbage the Chese sealed f the Philippes access to Ayung Shoal with fishg boats, surveillance ships,  navy destroyers creatg blockade so that the Filipos can\'t receive shipments  food  supplies. By buildg their own manmade Isls \'s essentially buildg naval bases.  more Isls they have the more ships they can support  more territory they can slowly take control . And the Chese cautiously use the cabbage strategy  the Spratly isls, takg over contested territory but  small steps avoidg the possibility  ignitg a bigger conflict. But the disputes are tensifyg. Countries are now actively arrestg trespassers  waters that they claim   could go a step further. Sce 2015 they\'ve threatened to declare an air identification zone above the South  Sea, declarg that all aircraft that fly through it would need Chese permission. Now, publicly  sists that their tentions are not militaristic but their actions say otherwise  it\'s heighteng tensions  the region Steve Bannon who sits on the US ional Security Council  who is one  President Trump\'s closest advisors is almost certa that the US will go to war  the South  Sea. ""We\'re gog to war  the South  Sea, I was a sailor there, a naval ficer, we\'re gog to war the South  Sea  five to ten years aren\'t we?"" ""there\'s no doubt about it"" But for now the disputes rema only  the legal  diplomatic realms that only occasionally break to mor clashes. In July 2016 the ternational court at the Hague ruled  favor  the Philippes who charged  with vadg their rightful territory  the South  Sea.  dismissed the rulg  enforcement  the law doesn\'t seem likely. Even from the US who released a vague statement urgg the two countries to ""clarify their claims""  ""work together to resolve their disputes"" which is another way  sayg ""we don\'t really want to deal with this"". In fact, as the conflict escalates  ternational courts get volved, the US is stuck  a tricky position. On one h, they do not want to risk provokg a conflict with . But on the other they want  to stop bullyg their allies  the region. Up until now the US has managed the situation by contug to patrol through the South  Sea. It\'s also likely that the US would fly fighter jets above the sea if  actually does declare an air identification zone. se are symbolic but effective ways  keepg Che  check while not gettg too volved  the details  the conflict. So far the disputes  the South  Sea have not become violent but countries are startg to defend their claims by creasg troop numbers, weaponizg their territory  provokg each other. It\'s a complex situation that will contue to ga ternational attention for better or for worse."

It\'s everywhere. re\'s no escape. Thank god for  . Thank god for  . Thank god for . You get the truth out. Thank god for  , or otherwise, no one would be talkg about these issues. In an ideal world, political journalism looks\nlike this. On either side, you\'ve got the parties fightg for the attention  the press. And  the middle, you\'ve got journalists sortg through what\'s important  what\'s just partisan bullshit. This is called gatekeepg,  it\'s one  the most important thgs\njournalists do. Political operatives can sp whatever talkg pots they want, but ultimately it\'s the journalists who decide what\'s newsworthy enough to pay attention\nto. But that is  an ideal world,  we don\'t live  an ideal world. We live  hell. And  hell, there\'s  .  exists  this weird between space because it claims to be a news organization but it\'s essentially a an front group.  network was founded by GOP political operative\nRoger Ailes. Not sure why he\'s posg like Shirley Temple\n this picture. Ailes spent his career advisg an presidents like Reagan, Bush Sr.,  surprise, surprise, Nixon. A memo from the Nixon Library detailed Ailes\' dream  launchg a an news\nnetwork. A plan for puttg the GOP on TV news. Which was described as a way to get around the ""prejudices  network news selectors."" Wow, nightmares really do come true. Ailes eventually founded  . And with it, he turned partisan hackery to\nan art form. Obama salutes while holdg cfee? Everyone\'s talkg about the disrespectful\nway the president saluted a Mare yesterday. Clton coughs durg a campaign event? We all have our coughg spells, but it doesn\'t look good when you have all these conspiracy theories about her health. Rashida Tlaib says a naughty word about Trump? We\'re gog to go  there, we\'re gog to\nimpeach the motherfucker. Is this what the Democratic Party has become? Buckle up, folks. This is the new Democratic Party. This is the Democratic Party  2019.  knows this fuckg bullshit doesn\'t actually\nmatter. But that\'s not the pot.  pot is pretendg that it matters, so voters at home thk it does too. Now, I know what you\'re thkg. Oh, my god. Who cares. It\'s . None  us actually watch that crap. Except you do watch that crap, Mary. You just don\'t realize it. Mary? Because once   goes all on a story, other networks pay attention. ""What\'s  conservative media? What are conservatives talkg about? Take Benghazi, for example. You\'re still mad about this? I\'m still mad about this. In 2012,  began peddlg wild conspiracy theories about a terror attack  Benghazi. Explosive new details about a possible White House coverup on Benghazi. Unanswered questions about Benghazi. Questions still rema unanswered. Some have suggested this is bigger than Watergate. \'s goal was to smear the Obama admistration,\nsure. But it was also to get other news outlets to take that smear seriously. I thk most journalists would be cled Why is the media not dealg with a clear\ncoverup here? And you say to yourself, And eventually, Mary, it worked. Aren\'t there still legitimate questions to be answered on Benghazi? Very serious unanswered questions. Legitimate questions. Too many questions. It\'s not just for   anymore, it\'s all\n cable news. So the result  that is that y all go talk about somethg, Thank god for   for beg tenacious\nenough to cause the mastream media not to ignore\nthis. re is no equivalent to this on the left. And that creates what Matt calls a ""hack gap."" Because conservatives can manufacture their own outrage cycles, mastream outlets pay a lot more attention to their bullshit. Which means even mor slipups by Democrats\ncan become careerdefg scals. In March, Democrat Ilhan Omar gave a speech about how Muslim organizations had to fight\nIslamophobia after 9/11. Pretty noncontroversial, right? Wrong aga, Mary. Because  April, an Dan Crenshaw accused Omar  trivializg 9/11 because she didn\'t say the word terrorist,\nI guess? I don\'t know. Am I bleedg aga? And the next morng,   knew what it\nhad to do. Really? Few people did somethg? You have to wonder if she\'s an American first. Downplayg one  the darkest days  our nation\'s history.  Democratic Party has a problem. Ilhan Omar is embroiled  another controversy\ntoday. After makg controversial comments. Do you feel she should apologize? Do you thk she should have rethought her\nwords? How do you thk this controversy is playg\nout among Democrats?  congresswoman needs to be careful about\nher own words too. This is the kd  hacky nonsense that good\ngatekeepg is supposed to protect us from. And it almost did. Nobody even cared about Omar’s speech for\nweeks after she gave it. But once  made it a story, it was over. Look at how many mastream news segments cluded clips from . How do you thk this controversy is playg out among Democrats?  hack gap is a nightmare  a normal year, but it\'s especially bad durg election season. In 2016, a lot  journalists realized that the Clton email server was not the national crisis  was makg it out\nto be. Could this new development put her behd\nbars? You\'ve got destruction  evidence. You\'ve got obstruction  justice. re\'s three specific laws that we found. re\'s at least seven that I\'ve found. Lock her up! Yes, lock her up. Ah, that pleases me. But because  viewers became fixated on Hillary\'s emails, Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! the story became newsworthy. I remember talkg to somebody who was a highrankg ficial  a major newspaper  I was askg him, And he said, ""Well, you know, Benghazi, her private email server. It\'s all part  the same narrative  why many voters don\'t trust her. Okay, fair enough. y came from  ; they came from conservative . talk radio.  American public know they can\'t trust\nher. Can\'t trust her. We can\'t trust her. So you put this stuff out. this email server. Years later, when it turns out that the Trump\nWhite House is also usg unsecured communication les, it doesn\'t spark the same monthslong crisis that Hillary\'s emails did, because there\'s no leftwg propaga mache baitg journalists to overreactg. It\'s not that there\'s nothg to these stories. Clton\'s email server was a mistake. Benghazi was a mess. Omar could have said the word terrorists more,\nI guess? Oh, god, it\'s  my ear now. It\'s that they get blown way out  proportion by a propaga mache that\'s tryg to score\npolitical pots. And by mastream journalists who are too afraid  lookg biased agast conservatives to call bullshit. And the weird genius  the hack gap is that if you\'re not watchg  , you won\'t\neven notice it. Because it doesn\'t look like  & \nor Hannity. It looks like serious journalists coverg\na serious controversy that they\'ve decided is important. But they aren\'t decidg. y\'re reactg to a political operation that was created to get you to pay attention. You can try to ignore   all you want. But as long as journalists are gettg their\nstory assignments from conservative media, you can\'t escape\nit. Thanks for watchg.

154,0.0,"That’s my wife. And she’s pregnant.When\nyou have a baby, there are lots  costs to consider. Isabel: Carseat,  a basset,\na baby carrier, thermometer. Johnny: Wait, wait, but how much is the actual hospital\nbirth gog to cost? Healthcare  the US is significantly more\nexpensive than  other countries. Some experts say that this is partly because consumers\ndon’t go around lookg for prices comparg them between hospitals. Like they do when\nthey buy a car or anythg else for that matter. So I decided it’d try it out. And see if\nthere was any way to discover  advance how much we would be payg for our baby’s birth.\nWhat happens next is at once depressg  horrifyg, showg how broken  expensive\nthe American health care system is. re\'s no way I\'m the only person who\'s ever\nhad this question. Childbirth  the US is the number one reason why people go to the\nhospital. most  million women are gog to give birth this year  most births are\nrelatively uncomplicated. So you would thk that with such a common procedure the price\nwould be generally well known. VO: I wanted to know how much child birth\nusually costs, so I did what any good child  the ternet would do I found this really disturbg study from\nthe Yale medical school .It analyzed almost 800,000 low risk deliveries  the US, lookg\nfor the variation  cost just for the facilities, meang the hospital rooms  supplies \nstuff like that. For just the cost  the hospital room, this\nstudy found that the price varied between $1,189  $11,986. So I realized I am gog\nto have to go ask the specific hospital where my wife is givg birth figure this out. Every\nhospital has a giant list they call the chargemaster which details all the services they provide\n what they cost. And each item  service  the hospital has a code. If a doctor spends\n20 mutes with you, that’s a different code  a different price than if they spent\n0 mutes with you. Your surance company then negotiates a lower price for every sgle\nitem on the list. So when my wife goes to the hospital,  nurses have a bar code scanner\nthat they use to scan every item she will use. Everythg from the IV tubes to the Ibupren\ngets scanned onto the bill. At the end  it all, they put all the codes  prices\nonto one piece  paper which they call a “claim""  send it f the surance. \nsurance looks at it  pays a certa percentage  it based on my policy.  hospital then\nsends the remag balance to me. So I figured if I could get my hs on that master list\n prices I could add up the price  the delivery. Right? Well it wasn’t that easy.\nI called the hospital where Isabel is gog to give birth  got a message mache. So\nI decided to call a some other hospitals to see if anyone could give me general pricg\nformation about the cost  birth. So my wife is pregnant. My wife is pregnant. My\nwife will be givg birth. My wife\'s pregnant  I\'m tryg to get an idea  how much\ndifferent services cost. Items that would be on a bill. Different costs associated with\nlabor  delivery. Hospital: One moment. Ok give me one moment let me talk to my team\nlead. Certaly, let me connect you with the billg fice. I can connect you with our\nfancial coordator. What I\'ll have to do is transfer you to the pricg le. I can\ntransfer you. Johnny: So now I\'m beg transferred to another le. Or somethg. I don\'t know.\ny\'re transferrg me somewhere. Answer the phone. Message Mache: I will be out\n the fice until Monday February 18th. Johnny: I\'m gog to hang up  try this\naga. Message Mache: You\'ve reached the voicemail  Patient Pricele. I will be\nout  the fice until February 18th. Johnny: Everyone\'s out  the fice. l agents are\ncurrently busy with other customers. Currently, all  our operators are busy. I\'m sorry,\nextension 59 didn\'t answer. Mash up  hold messages. Johnny: No  this time? I just\nhave to sit her on hold with no . I\'m just tryg to see if I can get a number.\nHospital: You will not get a copy  that until after the procedure. Johnny: Ok. Do\nyou have that formation though  terms  like how much certa items cost? Hospital:\nno, um they will not present the cost until after. Johnny: So there\'s literally no way\nfor me to discover what the cost is until after I buy is that right? Hospital: We do\nnot keep that formation on h. Everythg is processed after. Johnny: Certaly that\nformation exists  your hospital system somewhere. Hospital:  itemized copy, all\n that formation is done after the procedure, not before. Johnny: I haven\'t heard a sgle\nnumber from anyone about how much anythg costs. This is actually startg to become\nfrustratg. Fally, after two weeks  thirty phone calls I got ahold  a pricg\nconsultant from the hospital where Isabel\'s gog to give birth. I fally just got a\ncall back from a pricg consultant I wasn\'t able to record it because she called me out\n the blue. She had taken down all my surance formation  was able to run it through\nher system  come up with an estimate quote. And fally for the first time  two weeks,\nI heard a number. She said I would be payg $37 for my wife\'s birth. She wasn\'t able\nto give me a breakdown  what that meant or any items specifically. She was able to\nonly give me that number. And when I pushed on certa items she said she frankly didn\'t\nknow. Apparently prices  a hospital are beyond even a pricg consultant. And then\none day, this happened. I thk Izzy may be gog to labor. Here we go. I forgot about\nhealthcare prices for a moment  watched my amazg wife go through a night  paful\nlabor. She was the hero  the night  at the end  it, we had a new member  our\nlittle family. Oliver was born with no complications  a two day stay  the hospital. l very\ntypical. Well, I got the bill back  the mail  surance negotiated a lower[Oliver\ncries]. So the bill that came to us[Oliver cries] So the bill that came to  [Oliver\ncries]. Isabel: We got the fal bill back  the hospital charged sixteen thous\ndollars.  negotiated price with the surance company was eight thous dollars. y covered\n90%  it  sent us the bill for $81 dollars. Johnny: That\'s 500 dollars more than the pricg\nconsultant quotes me for a typical, uncomplicated birth which is what Isabel had. Our healthcare\nsystem suffers from a big problem which is that there\'s huge variation  costs. But\nwhat seems to be the bigger problem is that us consumers have no tools to fd out where\nwe fall  that pricg variation.  hospital down the street could be a fairly cheap hospital\nor it could be an extremely expensive oneit could be 10 time more expensive than the cheap\nones. You have no idea  there\'s no way to tell. And hopefully someday this will change.\nBut  the meantime, we got a really cute baby out  this whole thg. So, I\'m not\ncomplag. Thank you for for callg the patient Pricele.\nAt this time we are assistg other callers. But your call is important to us. Please speak\nclearly  leave your name  a number where you can be reached  someone will return\nyour call with..."

our own ocean I heard that on the dock somewhere well if you heard it on a documentary James I guess you're set no okay there's an old sayg but it's easier to explore the moon than the bottom  the ocean that's true for three reasons the ocean is cold it's crushg  it's corrosive that's why it's easier with boculars to explore the moon than it is with a scuba mask from a department store  just observe the bottom  the ocean carryon James David Blanche flower BSc he asks now that tardigrades have settled on the moon I wonder what their future holds will they successfully rehydrate can they

pump the heat out  this room or the balloon you're sittg on puttg outside the outside gets a little bit warmer but the scale  it hope surprises you the amount  heat we pump out  buildgs a't no nothg compared to with the amount  heat that we're holdg  by addg greenhouse gases to the Earth's atmosphere the heat isl effect  cities is as more from hard scape paved surfaces buildgs are not soil for

that the oceans are not boilg  the earth remas very warm side is evidence  an aphorism I hope you will embrace a sayg a way  lookg at the world that I hope you Liam will take to heart if thgs were any other way thgs would be different  here's what we mean by that deed the earth does radiate a large amount but relatively small amount  heat to the icy blackness  space the bottom  the ocean is the

know that it reflects  all different directions when it hits the ocean just you as the observer see a straight le  if you don't believe me get your friends to st  the le along the beach where you can call out to each other  ask each other if you each see a straight le  then ask yourself they're parallel or if you don't trust your friends  I don't blame you set up cameras take pictures along a kilometer or two carry on drew Andrew Ralston says okay okay I'll say how the planes work  I presume by that Andrew you mean airplanes because the Carpenters plane has a blade  you push it along the carpenter pushes it along  peels up the wood but an airplane works like a bird you get the momentum  air molecules gog down hasn't produces enough force to hold the wg up  the way you get air molecules gog down is get the wg gog fast what about a helicopter helicopter is wgs that are spng  the propeller blades either the exposed ones that you might see on what we would call a propeller aircraft or the turbe blades side the tubes on a jet airplane are they're gog around  a circle  they're pushg air molecules back so fast that they push the airplane forward it's not magic its science Gogi Rossum's asks I'm dog my best to pronounce your name go gyro sons Bill Nye if we took all the animals out  the ocean how much shallower do you thk the ocean would get  other words how much water do you animals displace I'll bet it's less than you thk animals like you  I are mostly water animals that live  the ocean are almost all water I don't thk it would change that much sce you asked how much do you thk my answer is not much carry on go Jiro Suns drew asked Bill Nye do you thk aliens actually exist so you want me to resist makg a joke about my old boss I don't know if he was an alien there are 200 billion stars  our galaxy  there are at least that many galaxies when I was  school it was speculated that there what might be a planet a sgle planet around one  every hundred stars now with observations from Hubble Space Telescope Kepler space telescope other ferential methods people thk there probably about ten planets around every star so that's another factor  a thous that takes you to the to trillions  just our galaxy if you got two trillion  anythg you got to figure somethg's gog to happen so there probably are aliens through the cturón  do fabulous  important Twitter style

I am an alien has been I've been sent here like the lg party that that one astronaut claims he believes  no I'm not an M one  you I'm one  us we're all  this together lks shall kill 89 Bill Nye how does fusion work do you thk we'll be able to have fusion power plants where we use nuclear power plants for 2050 fusion works by overcomg what's called the strong nuclear force the strong nuclear teraction  I believe it is quite reasonable we will have fusion not by runng a stream  protons to deuterium or tritium oh no but by runng a stream  neutrons to boron hydride gas stay tuned kc Koong writes bill nye I've been fascated  quite obsessed parenthetically with the alternate parallel universe theory oh you know that theory that theory about the alternate parallel universe so my question is this if such a thg where exists with the laws  physics necessarily have to apply to every sgle universe well so here's the th KC let's let's just take history  physics for example people got by they built pyramids they built they discovered round thgs roll made wheels all kds  agriculture was developed without really formalizg the laws or rules  physics or natural laws  so people presume that they knew what we call Newton's laws  motion were it for centuries  it was great we made all sorts  progress but then relativity was discovered  then quantum electrodynamics  we refed the laws  physics people when you're sophomoric view  the world the Isaac Newton was wrong I thk was pretty flipp right but then was we made more discoveries about the nature  mass  white  quantum electrodynamics we refed it so I presume if another universe exists  it has what we might call different laws  physics it doesn't mean that our laws  physics are necessarily wrong it just means they're complete every day we learn a little more Terry on kacie Brian Schmidt asks didn't I hear we could get to the next habitable planet  a few years with this space sail just need to say all the size  Texas  order to do it say all the size  Texas is not gog to take us to another habitable when  a few years but solar sails such as light sail too may revolutionize space exploration here  the solar system because we can go to extraordary speeds with no rocket fuel there are certa missions that solar sails are ideal for put a solar sail spacecraft at an ferior orbit closer to the Sun than the earth is  keep an eye out for asteroids or maybe more importantly importantly coronal mass ejections from the Sun which send a beam  charged particles slashg through space toward the earth which could disable many many  our communication systems so there are certa missions that solar sails are ideal for but a texassized one gog to a nearby habitable planet is probably not among them  I remd you that it's not the solar wd it's not particle streamg from the Sun that give a solar sail spacecraft to push it is light itself photons there's about a hundred times more pressure from photons than charged particles fascatg I hope carry on Brian bill nighy do sects feel gravity the same way we do yes the spiderman does whatever a spider can  course the spiders aren't sects but he doesn't do it because his understg  gravity is different he does it because because he's not real thank you for your questions we'll be back with more science support number four comg soon  when it does turn it up loud
156,0.0,I always felt like the difference between the United States  the Russian space programs could be summed up by the toilet because it was dicative  what a lot  the differences were I'm Mike Massimo  this is how hygiene is different  space [] hygiene  space is very important you're gonna have to do the same sort  thgs that you do want earth like brushg your teeth  keepg yourself clean usg the bathroom all  these thgs are very important  very different because you're dog them  space so they do require some trag  you want to do it correctly because if you don't it could lead to trouble on earth we deal with flush toilets if that's available hopefully to you you do what you need to do  then you clean yourself up then it's on to the remader  your day but  space it's different the flights that I had  space were on the space show  on the space shuttle we had a lavatory it was called the WCS the waste contament system I thk that was primarily because if he had a problem you didn't want to call houston we have a problem we messed up the toilet it didn't have a lot  privacy but it had some it had a privacy curta  the WCS had a hose for ure for you to urate to  a commode more or less for you to poop to  we want to use the word poop what do you want to poops okay we're not gonna fend then he went around a planet here okay takg a pee on the Space Shuttle was was pretty pretty quick  easy the holes came with an attachment that you would put on which was a funnel so everyone had their own we didn't share funnels  it was  a little compartment  you'd open up the compartment  there would be the seven funnels  you would take the appropriate one  attach it to the ure collection hose  then you would turn the system f what it does is it creates a little airflow so that it'll take the liquid down the hose  to the tank  when that tank reached a level that it was full we would do a ure dump out to space it would kd  crystallize  disappear more or less  the vacuum  space so it was okay to dump to dump ure out there if the Sun was shg who was shg through the dumped ure  beauty kd  like a rabow effect  that was kd  cool  when you were fished you would then turn f the system you would remove your funnel you would clean it  you would put it back  its appropriate space then you would clean up a little bit the quickest way to do that was just a wet wipe we had h sanitizer you could use some  that cause you don't want to spread any germs or anythg like that you want to be very cautious after you get a little experience you could do other thgs like peeg upside down this was a challenge given to me by a more experienced astronaut who said it is possible to pee upside down you should try it  you can you just flip yourself upside down I need to be a little more careful you don't want to do that on day one you know you don't want a hot dog it too much but it is possible to pee upside down which is kd  cool I've done that as well people on the space station is a little bit different than what we had on the space shuttle you still pee to a hose but unlike these dividual funnels it's a big yellow funnel  one size fits all but on the space station they recycle the ure along with recyclg sweat  condensation all that water is collected  then it is cleaned  it is treated  it is reused so as my friend Don Pettit says today's cfee is tomorrow's cfee poopg  space was very volved because you really don't want to mess this up this is our orbital outhouse right here I'll show you but you see it's pretty small so you have to have pretty good aim the key to this the way it was explaed to us  I agree the key to this is alignment next to our real shuttle toilet  the simulator we had a practice toilet that was not for defecatg it was made for alignment practice this is actually one  's deepest darkest secrets that we're gog over here  this camera poted up at you when you sat on this you had a call circuit TV right here so you would see on the camera whether or not you were aligned with the target area you would sit on there like you went on maybe on it like you thk you're on a regular on a regular toilet  here  then you check you're alive like whoaho I'm go we're near where I want to be on this  when you get yourself perfectly aligned the idea was to then try to memorize what that body position was so on the front  this thg there were like little platform to put your feet underneath okay as you're sittg on this thg but you can still you but could still come f the back  it  that's not good so  order to keep you but on the toilet seat we had these two little arms that would press you to the seat actually to help myself get the right position as I put my arms up like this like I was ridg a chopper I thought  Peter Fonda  a movie called Easy Rider that wasn't good alignment for me after you take care  busess we had a couple thgs to watch out for we had a mirror that we would be traed to then take from there was velcro to the wall we would take this mirror  then put it behd us so as we got f the toilet we saw if anythg was followg us if you get that what I mean okay  if there was somethg followg you you would sit back down  do whatever you thk was necessary to make sure whatever was followg you f the seat remaed where am I supposed to do you do a little shake if you need to  then if thgs get really out  control we have disfectant wipes just to make sure we clean up here the numberone stuff can sort  go all over the place if you don't aim correctly the poop remaed  the toilet we led with all  our poop  then the toilet was serviced once we got on the ground  on occasion people had messed up the procedure  therefore broken the toilet  that's really bad if you break the toilet  you can't poop  the toilet on a space shuttle the backup to that was what we called Apollo bags that had adhesive that you would tape to your butt that's the way they pooped  Apollo they did not have a regular toilet to use  that seemed extremely unpleasant right so we did not want to get to the Apollo bags  so that was kd  like enough to scare you you would make sure you did the procedure correctly on earth cleanless is very important what most  us do is we'll take a shower every day brush your teeth very important to brush your teeth brush your hair we need to shave but  space it's a little different water is somewhat  a resource particularly on the space station  so we want to conserve what we have  a big shower would use with these those lots  water so we really can't afford to do that so what we did  space  what the astronaut still do  space is you take more  a sponge bath where you have one washcloth that you would put a little water on  then you could put some soap to it  then soap yourself f this is our body wash so there's soap side  here we would fill this just like a drk bag as a valve at the top  we can squeeze the liquid soap out  it after we added water to it  then you would hang all  those thgs up to dry the ventilation system the circulation  air will allow it to dry  space space is a problem so the washcloths we use were packed very tightly on the space station now they have ones they look like almost like a hockey puck with  autumn there the wash clothes are kd  cool but you want to pack them as tightly as you can  the towels we have these big fluffy towels you can get on earth that's that happeng  space they're generally thner towels but pretty absorbent so they work really well the use  water is so important for our life havg clean water  a lot  places don't have clean water source right so we have this problem  space where we need to have water to live for drkg for hygiene  for preparg food because a lot  our food items are dehydrated so you add a little bit  water to those  so we've done a good job  learng how to effectively recycle water  be able to clean ure  water we use for different thgs so that it's usable aga  so that is the type  technology that can be very useful   parts  the world where gettg clean water is an issue washg our hair usually requires a lot  water on earth but  space we use rse less shampoo the Heron is right there it's got velcro on it if I wanted to put it down I could stick it to the wall  it's got a piece  Kapton tape on the top so it won't leak Kapton tape is space approved tape so what I did was add a little bit  water to a wash cloth  then rse with shampoo  then get a good lather gog  then aga take a towel   just dry f my hair with the tile  it worked great because you didn't have to rse her hair that way you generally used your own washcloth  towel that was somewhat  a personal item yeah shavg the way I shave on earth I use shavg cream  a  a razor on the sk  that requires runng water you can do that  space  they do have a special shavg cream you can use they call it astro edge  you can also use a razor but then you've got to do somethg with the cream  the whiskers that are comg f what I opted for was an electric razor  the whiskers were contaed  the unit itself  then you would clean it if you needed to very carefully with a vacuum we generally get a haircut pretty close at a time that we're gonna fly  space on the space station you're up there for six months  so you need to be concerned about a haircut  so for that to have an electric Clipper aga that's attached directly to a vac so that as you create hair it'll get sucked right to the vacuum stuff like dead sk cuttg your fgernails or toenails you want to do that stuff near the vent so that it gets captured by the vent  then you can clean it f this was a toothbrush that I took with me to space  could provide you with the stard governmentissue toothbrush but if you provided one  your own they would pack it for you  fly it  you could use that  space if he had a favorite toothbrush so I saw this as an opportunity to do somethg fun so I went out  purchased this astronaut toothbrush to have  space   then converted it to a space toothbrush by puttg a piece  velcro on it  space you brush your teeth the same way more or less you used toothbrush  toothpaste  then you rse your mouth but then the question is what do you do with that stuff  there are two options you can either be a spitter or a swallower if you're a spitter I felt that was a little more complicated because you have to you know sp to a washcloth  deal with it so what I do is I just swallow the toothpaste space sounds glamorous doesn't it I wear contact lenses  even spacewalk with my contact lenses some guys didn't want to do that but I always warm I figured you know as long as I wasn't messg with my eyes I'd be ok there was a concern though with the docks about us havg clean hs when we put the contacts   so he had wipes  I guess you can use on earth as well if you were concerned I did not lose a contact  space I felt very fortunate that the nab to do laundry on earth is fairly straightforward then we have maches that help us but  space it's different because we don't have a lot  water  space it is hard to wash clothes on the space shuttle we had a different shirt everyday  we had a different pair  underwear every day  we had pants  shorts that would be worn for a few days  so we didn't do laundry we just packed that stuff up once we wore the shirt  we put it  a kd  a clothg b but it was like a big bag  then that stuff would be returned to Earth   cleaned  returned to us clean on the space station they kd  rely on the supply ships to brg them the new clothes the dirty laundry will get packaged put to a supply ship  has been emptied  supplies  now becomes a dumpster  that stuff will burn up under the entry it does however on occasion get stky  space what you smell  space  the cab is generally each other when we led on the shuttle after this situation for a few weeks the people that would open up the hatch would get a whiff  this  be like was usually the reaction the more experienced recovery technicians would know that ahead  time  be prepared for you go to your spacesuit to spacewalk that becomes your dividual spacecraft it does not come with its own toilet the rule was on spacewalkg days the two people gog out to spacewalk have first dibs on the toilet you want it take care  that as best you can before you go out  then you put your diaper on to make it astronaut pro some nice person who packs our stuff writes front on the diapers so we don't put it on backwards  then we put our fancy coolg garment on  then we start gettg dressed with the rest  the space you know once you're locked side  there you have no access to the toilet any longer so if you're gonna go you're gonna do it  the  the diaper  you're really discouraged from poopg  that thg because you really don't want that stuff gettg loose  there  the diapers should work but why take the risk when we were launchg on the space shuttle we were gog to be puttg a diaper on as well  when we got dressed so you'd want to use the bathroom at crew quarters  then you put on your spacesuit with a diaper  you go out to the launch pad now on the launch pad itself there is a toilet we call it the last toilet on earth because you use it  then you go to space the last thg you do before you go flyg or go to a simulator where you're gonna be stuck is you go to the bathroom it's part  the checklist we do have a thermal control so you try to keep yourself cool while you're spacewalkg so you don't sweat prusely but still you're gonna be movg around  you're gonna be sweatg a bit one thg you learn  aviation as you go to different altitudes thgs are gog to exp meang your stomach I remember the the who was a Navy guy that was trag us  this  he said your social graces go out the wdow when you're  get side  the airplane you know you might have some extra gas so he said you don't worry about that you because you don't want to get a stomachache  so the same thg is  your spacesuit but if you break wd side  your spacesuit you're the only guy that's gog to be smellg it  you won't smell it I thk for the future hygiene  course is gonna be important on the spatial it was a shortterm issue you know you could conta all the poop for a couple weeks on the space station now they have a better plan because you're up there longer periods  time but still the proximity to the earth gives you some advantages you can get resupplied  clothg you can get resupplied  water you can get resupplied  a lot  the thgs you need because we're  low Earth orbit once we start movg further away from the planet it's gog to be harder to do that  resupply it's not gog to be as easy as it is now so I thk we are gog to need a way to wash clothes when we go further away from our planet  we're gog to need a way to do that that doesn't require a lot  water also we're able to conta a lot  the the germs  bacteria we try to go to space very healthy you have a quarante period ahead  time so you don't have that we have just about every medice imagable available to us hygiene wise but eventually as we get further  further away that may be more  an issue as well  contag some  the contamants bacteria if you're very far away from Earth you're gog to have to solve that problem on your own so I thk dealg with germs cleanless  resupply are gonna be a bigger issue as we go forward where you're gonna need to take all your toothpaste with you or figure out a way to make it or somethg so we've got to thk about these issues as you move forward [] you
157,0.0,five four three two one hi I'm commer Chris Hadfield astronaut spaceship commer space Walker parttime ian I'm here today to hopefully debunk some common space myths here's this common perception that you will immediately fry to a crisp by the unfiltered unadulterated solar radiation if you get sucked out  the airlock  truth it's way worse than that  the shade  space it's like mus 250 degrees but the part  you that's  the Sun it's plus 250 degrees at least so it's gonna start boilg  burng so it's like lyg on a redhot stove with a piece  dry ice on your back  your lungs are gonna be sucked flat stantaneously but even worse than that is your blood is gonna boil like openg a can  pop where suddenly that all the little bubbles come out because there's no air pressure around you so simultaneously you are gog to freeze boil burn get the bends  no longer be able to breathe not a good way to go I've done two spacewalks  I was very thankful to have a spacesuit around my body so that none  those thgs that happen to me [] sometimes you hear that you have to work out constantly or you will pass out  possibly die  space not true livg on a spaceship is the most lazy existence you can image you're weightless you do not have to lift a fger you don't have to hold your head up your heart doesn't have to lift your blood agast gravity you can be the laziest person  the universe  space but eventually you need to come back to earth  if you don't exercise for your whole 6 months  space you're sort  turn to a jellyfish so we do exercise two hours a day on a spaceship we have a resistive mache we have a unicycle  we have a treadmill where elastics hold us down just to keep our bodies strong enough  our bones dense enough so when we get home we don't just fall over like a pole but you don't need to work out you've probably heard that space has a smell maybe like burnt steak or some type  barbecue that's true when you come  from a spacewalk you're surrounded by the emptess  space it's sort  like the opposite  air there's nothg there at all when you quickly repressurize the hatch  you open up the hatch  you smell what is that lgerg smell from a place that used to be exposed to space but smell  there is a little bit like that trace  a smell  gunpowder or a burnt steak or to me it's sort  like brimstone like a which has just been there it's a cool lgerg trace  a smell I thk what it really is is the emptess  space the vacuum  space is actually pullg trace chemicals out  the metal  the walls  the ship little bits  stuff you never smell because normally there's air pressure holdg them to the metal they're slowly f gassg those ty little trace gasses  trace particles that otherwise they never get to your nose  those are released sort  that metallic gunpowder fired smell that's where the smell is comg from maybe it's not even comg from space it's just sort  comg from spaces effect on our ship yeah  truth smells a little bit like a burnt steak so there's a lot  word out there that if you go credibly fast like the speed  light if you could travel at the speed  light that you won't age  despite thouss  years gog by you'll stay the same but everybody that you know will die that's not really true Este called it relativity because what he meant was your agg will be different relative to people's agg on earth you'll still age time will still pass for you but people on earth will age at a different rate so that if you came back after gog credibly fast you would have gotten older by the amount  time that it took for you to travel but people on earth would have aged much much faster they would have had a longer period  time because even get gog fast enough your speed is sort  proportional to the time passg so you'll still age but you just a't a different rate than people back on earth Este did this cool thought experiment image if you were lookg at a clock that the light from the clock is comg  hittg your eyeballs  tellg you it's 12 o'clock I'll image if you could move away from that clock at the speed  light it would only say 12 o'clock because that light  you would be movg away from the clock at the same speed so for you it would look like it was always 12 o'clock forever you'd still be gettg older but that clock would always look like it was the same time the people on earth were contug to live they're not aware  you go on the speed  light so you can see that the time for you because  your speed is relatively different than the time for the people on earth it's a really unusual thg to try  grasp  your head what happens when somethg blows up  space if somethg explodes  space will it make a sound  could a human hear it it's a pretty easy question to answer the Sun is just an explosion the Sun is the biggest explosion any  us can image it's a huge contuous thermonuclear explosions every atom bomb we've ever built way more than that contuously explodg it would be the loudest thg imagable it's constantly happeng but we don't hear a whisper  it  that's because there's nothg to carry the sound from the Sun to us even though it's credibly violent there's nowhere for the pressure  all  that sound all  that noise to be carried across the emptess  space to shake my eardrum   let me hear the sound  the Sun it's a good thg it'd be deafeng so if somethg explodes  space it makes sound but there's no way for that sound to be carried across space so that I could hear there is this idea out there that maybe the only way that we could really create gravity is to sp the spaceship so that everybody is stuck to the sides like one  those rides at the fair where you're pned agast the wall  for now that's actually true we don't know how to control gravity we have no way to control gravity we can sort  pretend there's gravity by spng a ship  everythg stick to the sides like a ball on the end  a strg maybe someday we'll figure out how to control gravity but for now we have to sp the whole ship only  the middle would they be weightless I've seen that people thk that  is workg on warp speed so that we can travel at the speed  light to terstellar planets warp speed is an vention  science fiction if we knew how to work on warp speed we would we don't know how to go anywhere near the speed  light it takes an unlimited amount  energy the faster you go the more energy it takes a equals MC squared it goes up with the square  the speed  fact so how can you generate that much electricity  what does it do to your mast we don't know we thk maybe it's possible that you could go faster than the speed  light but we sure don't underst how right now so we're not really workg on it so it's not really true we're hopg for  so many movies you see that the only way that they survive terstellar travel from one star to another is to freeze yourself to cryo sleep we don't know how to do that right now when you freeze water which is what we're mostly made  our blood  everythg it goes to crystals it turns to ice crystals  if you allow the beautiful delicate nature  your human body to exp to ice crystals it'll destroy the structure  you it'll kill you you know frostbite destroys it so that you get gangrene  your h you'd end up with entirely destroyed body so right now we do not know how to successfully freeze a human body so that it is not gog to be permanently destroyed maybe we'll figure it out someday but all  those movies that rely on freezg the crew we don't know how to do that it's not real you see on the ternet all the time someone has built a balloon  they've launched some little figure with a camera attached to it where they take a picture way up high  the atmosphere you can see the curvature  the earth it's pretty cool but there's some people thkg you could fly yourself all the way up to the stratosphere with some sort  highaltitude balloon you can actually but it's really complicated Felix Baumgartner when he did his his leap out  a balloon  actually go through the speed  sound fallg down towards the Earth  lg with a parachute he was way up to the stratosphere the stratosphere starts at about six or seven miles up it's not all that high then that goes on for a long way there's not enough air to breathe you kd  need to have an airler with the pressure side to keep your body healthy if you're that high but if you take the right equipment with you yes we can use a balloon to lift us high enough to get all the way up to the stratosphere so if you have the right equipment it's true you've probably read somewhere on the ternet that if you go to the Space Station your body will get taller sort  exp  it'll be paful  you're gonna be taller forever an irreversible experience  it's not really true as I'm stg here talkg right now gravity is pushg me down towards the floor every sgle bone  my body  a little bit  gristle that's  between the bones like each  the vertebra  my back everyone has a little disk  between each  the bones  even my hip bones on my knee bones there's a little bit  a gap well if there's no gravity pushg me down  those gaps can all get a ty bit bigger if you stay  weightlessness for a few weeks  fact your body just sort  stretches because the gap between each  the bones gets a little bigger   my case I got about that much taller but you aren't really taller you're just sort  temporarily longer but it's not permanent as soon as you get home  gravity starts dog its its work on you  grdg you down everythg squishes back down to its launch so you maybe for a little while a little bit taller  space  it may hurt your back a little cuz everythg's sort  gettg pulled tight some people have back pa  space as a result but it's not really growg it's just sort  stretchg to your natural maximum that you're gonna get squished back aga as soon as you get home if you do get maybe that much longer after you've been  space for a few weeks thk what your pants would be like you're you know they're gonna they're gonna be high above your ankle  if you put on a spacesuit who customfit the spacesuit to the size  your body but we know it's gog to happen so we actually plan  advance we fit our spacesuits knowg that the astronauts are gonna be a little bit taller when they're  space or at least their bodies are gonna be a little bit stretched  even the seat that protects us when we come back to earth the crash seat so that when we hit the ground it protects us properly we allow for the fact that our back bones are gonna be slightly longer when we're up there but your clothes you don't really know how they fit because you're floatg around weightless your shirt is always floatg around your body so you never really have a sense up there how well your clothes fit just because there's no gravity to pull them down  look  see how well they're fittg on your body it's more like they're just floatg next I've read somewhere that onboard the International Space Station bacteria multiplies ten times faster  space so if you get sick your body is gonna be like torn apart by this ravenous stra  mutant Salmonella now it is a different place than Earth the space station we run around with little swabs all the time to measure what microbes  what viruses  what little ty bits  life might be growg on the spaceship we also go around with little cleaners  wet wipes  wipe down the whole space station all the time like  a hospital to try  keep the whole thg clean  hygienic  we are fdg that some  those primitive forms  life do mutate slightly differently  the high radiation weightless environment  the spaceship but no one has died yet because  the mutant Salmonella I'm Chris Hadfield hopefully this has helped answer some  those comments basements
158,0.0,"so I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson your personal astrophysicist  I was vited  with these fun props like flated planets to answer questions your questions about the universe so brg it on [] questions from the ternet I got one here from Ca Jackson how many stars are born per year how many died well it's about a hundred a year  our galaxy we've had like a stable amount for the last several billion years  where you calculate that is we have about a hundred billion stars  the galaxies  universes ten or so billion years old about a hundred a year maybe ten  a hundred a year so you got it next up from Maccabees dude love questions that beg with dude there's literally a quark called strangeness because nobody freakg knows what the hell it's dog but what is gog on damn I hate physics that's not a question we have quarks named updown bottom top strange  charmed we don't see them directly we can't tell you what we can't show you a photo  them so they're just placeholder words for them so just like just get used to that all  quantum physics transcends our personal life experience so to describe it we have to sort  vent words one  them is just strange that doesn't mean we can't describe it  know what it how it behaves    itself  with other quarks so don't put too much meang  the word itself it's the idea that matters next Jordan is it just a cocidence the two major hurricanes a spreadg wildfire  now  8. magnitude earthquake followed the solar eclipse yes by the way there's solar eclipses every 18 months or so fd somethg to happen there  you want to blame it on the eclipse okay go ahead people did that for millennia no no what do we have here a dagger a p.m. if dark energy makes the universe exp it makes it might make more or new space can we use that space to make dark energy um I I don't know by the way dark energy is not so much makg us exp we were already expg it is makg the expg universe accelerate that's what's gog on evidence shows that dark energy is not beg created  the expansion  the universe so I thk the answer to this is no but if one day we could control dark energy  a lab maybe we might discover terestg properties  its relationship to dark matter I don't know to be determed watch this space next up on Twitter charles william johnson if the Higgs boson etc forms an essential part  reality which it does why can't it be found  our front room or all around us there's certa parts  our fundamental reality that you only ga access to under certa conditions  pressure  temperature  energy you don't experience a proton  your life but it's a fundamental part  nuclei that make up the atoms that comprise your body so just because you don't see it feel it touch it taste it or smell it does not mean it does not exist  part  the entire purpose  why we have science at all  particular the methods  tools  science is to decode that which is true about nature that otherwise transcends your sensory perceptions that is what science is you wouldn't need the tools if our bra sensory system accurately decoded the world around us but it doesn't  that's why science tries to fd any way it can to remove your bra ie R nose mouth touch from the operation  the more we can successfully do it the less bias shows up  the result just get the human out  it so yeah reality is not what you perceive it's what the methods  tools  science reveal next up Wow across the universe is a al I don't know is it I love als if it is I'm embarrassed that I haven't heard  it but it ought to be seems to me the universe would be really good next Marilyn Baker what is a quantum particle is it like say a quark where's an electron what quantum physics is the study  everythg that matters on that scale electrons quarks neutrons nuclei themselves atoms themselves molecules themselves there is no understg  what they do without quantum physics that's how small particles roll  this world hope that answers your question with these hundreds  newly confirmed exoplanets how many are possibly habitable by the actual scientific method we have so you look for exoplanets planets orbitg other stars some fraction  them are  the Goldilocks zone not too close if it had liquid water would evaporate not too far they haven't had liquid water would freeze now you can calculate what that is for any star  so there's a subset  all the thouss  exoplanets there's a few hundred that orbit  the Goldilocks zone life as we know it could thrive there haven't found life still lookg for life but it could thrive there by the way there are other sources  heat sources  heat from tides that are created from the ma planet Jupiter for example on to its moons so there are moons  Jupiter Jupiter's way outside the Goldilocks zone the moons  Jupiter are kept warm by this sort  gravitational massagg it's called tidal heatg tid  tidal heatg so you might have life as we know it on the moons  planets that have tidally heated those moons so that opens the net forecast a much wider net  a search for life  the universe I'm not sure if anyone has asked or answered but I'm curious where was Neil Tyson for the solar eclipse hopefully it was a clear sky thank you for those warm wishes it was a state secret where I was right up until the Eclipse I was at deadwood lookout 7,200 feet up  the mountas  Idaho checkg out the total solar it is the universe expg to a space bigger than the universe itself is there a clear limit to the expansion so yeah we're expg but if that's what we defe all  space to be then there's higher dimensions to which this is happeng  prciple you can go outside  our universe  look down on it or up to it but then you're  another dimension so we don't have access to that dimension so we're stuck we did dimension you're given three spatial one time dimension get over time for just a couple more whatever a Donnie yell if aliens exist how do I know I'm not one well if you visited another planet with life you'd be an alien to them clearly you're probably not an alien because you share all the same organs  the same place with the same biochemistry  highly common DNA with the person sittg across from you  everyone else walkg this earth you have DNA  common with yeast cells with an apple with oak trees so that's some  the best evidence we know that you yourself are not an alien Jacob Warren you all believe  quantum mechanics or a theory  relativity which one is better you don't have that choice they each exist  work  make predictions that are verified they're both kd  crazy but they apply to reality now it turns out we already know the limits  relativity it can't describe the center  a black hole so we know relativity will have to be extended or modified  those extremes to underst that quantum physics quantum mechanics it works every sgle place we have ever applied it every sgle place so  that regard it is the most successful theory  the universe that has ever been put forth it could be possible that  the future quantum physics will subsume relativity entirely to get you to those sgularities the center  the black hole  the begng  the universe but right now they both work  we're completely happy with them last one naphthalene Twitter so the theory  relativity the prediction  the effects gravitational fields  space than peace I thk the rise  science has promoted greater peace  prosperity  the world certaly prosperity  ten where there's prosperity there's less  a need to take your neighbor's stuff if you look at the era  science  look at the kds  wars people fought  what fraction  people would die  a war  a culture  spite  even these aberrations such as the first  second world war a much smaller fraction  all humans died  those wars than who died  tribal wars if you go back thouss  years you could lose a third  your men fightg  a battle just to ga access to a property that does not happen  organized war no war is good  course but it may be that science as a path to prosperity  health will remove many  the reasons why we ever had war  the first place so a theory  relativity has another branch physics science  general peace yeah peace yes so very impressed with the cosmic curiosity out there keep them comg  as always keep lookg up guys know about this especially a thermometer it's a closed system  this air  here room temperature is generally cooler than your body temperature this is why we have to eat contuously as warmblooded creatures to mata this temperature difference we're basically 100 degree organisms right air is 70 degrees so if I warm this air then [] cool"
159,0.0,bill  I here I'm back to answer some  your science questions this is science support part 2 angel supreme could be an El supremo if the earth is round why doesn't all the water fall f the water is held on the earth by gravity  get this so is the air wait there's more not only is the earth gravitationally pullg on the water the water is ever so slightly gravitationally pullg on the earth  sea this is Isaac Newton's sight he saw the Apple fall f the tree  he realized that not only is the earth somehow pullg the Apple down but the Apple is mutually gravitationally pullg the earth up like dude that's so out there I know I know miss misery how charmg my dad I don't get the Internet seriously where does it come from how does it work the Internet is a system  computers  we are able to store formation for example an alphabet or numbers can be represented by a code that everyone's agreed on  the code is a pattern or a system  bary bits this is to say either ons or fs  you sir miss misery's dad I'll bet you are  a certa age or you remember Morse code Morse codes the same thg it's either a dot or a dash a dit or a da so we've taken it to a whole nother level  dits  DAHS where we are able to store  transmit billions  trillions  quadrillions  sextillion z'  bits to represent language numbers calculations  you are part  this greater whole what a time to be alive man way to go Chelsea Briggs whoa did a meteor just hit my home state  Michigan everyone is callg me is the world comg to an end I would say based on my presence here or how you can't see it but there's a crew  camera  audio people here I don't thk the world ended as we know it just judgg  so far as you were able to send the text I bet the world didn't end for you either so once  a while a meteor streaks through the sky now for fun I'll give you these three words meteor means somethg streakg through the sky Meteor has to do with the sky  greek a meteorite is what you call it when it makes it all the way to the Earth's surface as an tact rock an asteroid is different a comet is different yes that's four words but yeah meteors come to our atmosphere streak through the sky all the time meteorites once  a while if you like to worry about thgs you're livg at a great time because we discovered that the ancient dosaurs were almost certaly wiped out by a great big asteroid or a cluster  asteroids midjune wha why can't I walk through solid objects  all I made  his neurons protons  electrons so let me say I thk you tossed  the word neuron when you may have meant Neutron but neurons enable you to thk about this  keep  md that protons  electrons are not all you're made  there's also some energy drivg these thgs around makg them teract  there are this fabulous subatomic particles the subatomic particles are  turn made  others even smaller particles quarks  so these thgs all teract  if you like to wonder about thgs this is a great thg we are made  protons neutrons  electrons  the reason you can't walk through solid objects the reason objects like you are solid is because these thgs especially the electrons repel each other so when you try to push on somethg the electrons repel each other so strongly that we perceive it as a solid object all the electrons neutrons  protons came together  they are almost entirely made  exploded ancient stars so you  I are made  Stardust you  I are at least one way that the universe knows itself oh I hope that fills you with reverence I hope you stop  thk about that at least once every day middle school span teacher  drew are the seats  the front  the plane the best to avoid turbulence generally yeah especially sweptwg aircraft will do this  remded some aeronautical engeers  a Dutch person on ice skates so traditionally it's called Dutch roll  you damp out the Dutch roll with the rudder on the vertical tail so yeah generally the front  an airplane is smoother than back but this is a pretty subtle effect  the modern world maybe on an old md80 or dc9 McDonnell Douglas  ne aircraft or maybe even on md80  maybe even an old 707 you'd feel that but nowadays hardly ever why because  the couplg  stability  control  our understg  computers  our ability to have computers to not only do position velocity acceleration  jerk but also snap whoa carry on sit wherever you like that Elisha underscore Blackburn writes does anyone really know how gravity works the answer is we know with extraordary precision what gravity will do we can l spacecraft on Mars takg to account general  special relativity speed  the spacecraft  the fluence  the Earth's gravity on the rate at which we perceive time passg we can take that to account to have your cell phone tell you which side  the street you're stg on we can do that but where gravity actually comes from remas a mystery icia Blackburn you are livg at a time when we may discover how this happens last summer we built these big terferometry gravitational observatories  we

you we underst that very well  we use waves to analyze this flow  energy well people who discovered relativity Este's the famous guy realize that gravity should perhaps also travel  waves  we could make predictions with that  we built these observatories  we've discovered them prove that they existed who knows what the future holds is an excitg time go wild Shea at Sger under Explorer 7 teen if trees produce oxygen then can't paper do the same thg if it's made out  trees I underst the premise  your question but compare how well a fish swims when it's alive with how well it swims after you've caught it  killed it we make paper out  dead trees dead trees don't move around as much  they don't produce nearly as much oxygen carry on che Jules watch them I was just thkg gog that's good I'm glad Jules artificial telligence becomes more telligent we might want to stop usg the term artificial to describe it I mean the best AI is one that learns itself right so is it really artificial either way let's not start f on the wrong foot heart symbol icon emoji thg artificial telligence gets the term because humans created computers that act as though they are what you  I call telligent for me the le that will be crossed is when our computer systems which are artificially telligence choose to make art when our artificial telligence decides to do somethg just for the sake  dog it then we will have cross the le to telligence so right now I'd stick with AI  don't be freaked out about AI you get on a you go to an airport you get on the tram that takes you from termal a to termal C  you trust it because engeers have designed a system that figures out how much you weigh how much your luggage weighs how fast the door should open where it should stop how fast it should accelerate how fast it should slow down it's all that done  you trust it it's just the next few levels with the thg would get more  more complicated what we don't want is for worldwide systems  the artificial telligence to become so sophisticated that we can't predict what they're gog to do or there's there's so many movg parts you can't tell what's gonna happen that's what we don't want that's how we get blackouts  electrical grids  stuff but you're out there Jules you're thkg deep thoughts way to go at a yo Tristan did I just hear thunder  a snowstorm is that a thg yeah it's a thg thunderstorms happen when it's

by the premise by the bit what makes you thk climate change the cause the ice age was a good thg oh can I get over there  what is now France they had it gog on they lived  caves they hunted gathered  scavenged they had sex they carried on who knows what they buried their dead carefully well I was at a good thg everythg got hot people started walkg all over the earth I mean was that really good but why the reason climate change today is a bad thg is the speed it's the rate at which humans like you  I are causg climate change that's the problem you  I are causg climate change  it's the speed people are gonna have to abon coastal cities as their floods come  more  more frequently the pests that fect our crops pests are showg up earlier  stickg around later it's the speed Lattimore alder that is the trouble  whether or not ice age endg was a good thg it depends on whom you ask go out there if go back  time take a meetg with OGG  I'll get  see if they thought it was great when there

can you please expla the science tryg to answer this question for me wet is sort  defed by water yeah so if there's water present it's generally gonna be wet with that set we  fluid mechanics thk  air wettg the surface  a baseball or a bird's wg or an airplane way we talk about weddg  here's the defition  weddg from a fluid mechanical stpot for your consideration Myra Brunetta it's when the fluid sticks to the surface air is a fluid anythg it flows is a fluid so if it sticks to the surface then the surface is wetted so try this get a flask sp it with water  it sp it  you'll see the water takes on some  the sp  the glass because it's stuck to the surface take a pgpong ball  give it a lot  sp either with a racquet a paddle or your fgers the AR stickg to the surface wettg the surface fluences its flight but now whacks the hood  a car  put water droplets on it they beat up they don't wet the surface thank you for these questions I'm really glad you all are ponderg these thgs I am NOT some brilliant guy okay I'm just scientifically literate but the questions so far have been addressed  science when you're very well understood  you  I depend on them that's why we have shapes made  glass

160,0.0,"my name is Chris Hadfield I'm dog the wired autocomplete terview let's beg what Chris Hadfield  the search enge here we go what spired Chris Hadfield to become an astronaut the first people to walk  the moon when Buzz dr  Neil Armstrong walked on the moon  July 20th 69 I thought if they could do that I could do that that spired me what was Chris Hadfield education I went to a bunch  different schools but basically I'm a farmer  mechanical engeer  a pilot fighter pilot test pilot that's was my education become an astronaut what was Chris Hadfield first job I grew up on a farm but when you growg up on a farm it's not really sort  a job was just what you do every day after school my first real job was workg  a scientific shippg warehouse when a school ordered scientific equipment I was the guy back   the shippg department that would collect the the pig fetuses or the the weigh scale put him  a box   mail them to your school that was my first job what did Chris Hadfield fd  space did I fd  space a new way to look at the world what did Chris Hadfield this is terrible English what did Chris Hadfield learned from gog bld well I learned better English from this sensor durg my first spacewalk there was contamation side my space they've gotten both my eyes blded me what did I learn from that number one don't panic panic doesn't really help especially if you're all alone  space  the second was you need to do a better job  cleang the visor  your space helmet because it was actually the antifog  the visor that good to my eyes that made me go  bld so remember if you're dog a spacewalk clean your visor really carefully  don't let it get  your eyes  you probably won't go bld emergg from below as ten Scrolls on a computer screen these are the questions that beg with where where Chris Hadfield where does Chris Hadfield live I live on earth wasn't always true but right now I live  Toronto Ontario Canada  I like it there it's a nice city it's wellrun good place you get a chance live  Toronto where was Chris Hadfield born I was born about I don't know maybe a couple hundred yards from the US border right on the edge  Canada  a town called Sarnia Ontario  Sarnia General Hospital August 29th 1959 makes me a Virgo where is Chris Hadfield right now on earth I'm  Las Vegas baby  what happens here falls on the floor where did Chris Hadfield go  space I went around  around  around the world we launched out  Florida we're actually on my third flight we launched out  Kazakhstan just south  Russia you go straight up for a while then the spaceship turns over start gog faster  faster  faster parallel to the surface  the earth so that the whole trajectory  the spaceship is to go around the world  if you can get gog seventeen  a half thous miles an hour five miles a second 25 times the speed  sound then you'll stay  space basically forever you'll just coast once you get there so that's what I did gotten three different rocket ships blasted f went around the world two thous six hundred  fifty times so I went on a pretty amazg world tour more than Keith Richards I thk all right oops all right this one at risk  puttg shadows on my face says when Chris Hadfield when when Chris Hadfield let's choose him verb here when did Chris Hadfield first walk  space I first walked  space durg my second spaceflight we were on board space shuttle Endeavour we were buildg the International Space Station image you're wearg the most uncomfortable clothes you've ever worn like like a big snow suit or somethg end gloves  a hat  big boots you can hardly move you grab on to both sides  the hatch  you sort  like maybe a chick comg out  an egg you know you have to sort  fight your way out but then you pull yourself out  you're weightless let go with one h  you float around gently the other way  suddenly you've gone from this claustrophobic little dark place to now beg surrounded by eternity where the whole world is silent next to you like this big magic globe but it's separate from you but all around you is the three dimensions   everythg  it's perfectly black it's it's unbelievable like you've given birth to yourself to a whole new place if you get a chance go on a space walk when was Chris Hadfield last Space Flight seven years ago right now I was onboard the International Space Station it was 2012 2013 it was so cool cuz I was up for half a year so we went halfway across the solar system like we went from one side  the Sun to the other while I was on board the ship pretty neat watch the whole world like swap ends what was wter  the northern hemisphere became sprg got to watch the snow  everythg move  thgs start turng green the time I was up there okay when will when will Chris Hadfield while drum roll please get out  space I don't even know what that question means maybe people out there searchg on Google maybe they thk I'm still  space I'm still spaced out well I know I've been back for seven years  happily so there's no choices we're all  space all the time where would I go space is all around us why Chris Hadfield all right why is Chris Hadfield a hero he's not why is Chris Hadfield important to Canada I was the first dog several thgs I was the first Canadian to do a spacewalk I was the first Canadian to comm a space ship I was the first one to use the big robot arm  if you're Canadian you're really payg attention you'll notice the name  the robot arm is the canid arm so there's this great big arm with Canadian flags on it out  space beg operated by a Canadian with a Canadian flag on her shoulder for the first time big ridiculously Canadian moment so I thk that's why I'm important to Canada white why did Chris Hadfield retire because I got a Holt look at my hair because I was never gonna fly  space aga  once you've done all the thgs you should do an astronaut it's time to go do somethg else why is Chris Hadfield Space Oddity an odd phraseology but I get a version  David Bowie's classic tune Space Oddity which was a play on the word Space Odyssey  I played it on guitar  recorded on the space station  lots  people have seen it it's actually a really beautiful song  David Bowie loved my version  it which was a huge compliment he said really nice thgs which was great why is Chris Hadfield under the ocean this you may not know I lived at the bottom  the ocean for like two weeks because livg at the bottom  the ocean side a habitat it's sort  like livg  space side a habitat it's a good way to tra for the technical stuff but also psychologically if you can't immediately come up to the surface if you have to solve all your problems yourself it's not a bad psychological trag ground for beg an astronaut so if you see Chris Hadfield under the ocean that's probably why what Chris Hadfield okay let's choose a word what is Chris Hadfield famous for I thk I'm most famous for strangely enough playg  I mean I'm an astronaut I've done spacewalks I was 's director  operations  Russia I tercepted Soviet bombers f the coast  North America durg the height  the Cold War but I thk I'm most famous for playg guitar  sgg Space Oddity  orbit I've made a lot  effort to communicate with people usg social media durg my third spaceflight I made a bunch  videos if I go to any school around the world they've been watchg those videos sort  as as part  their science classes the ease   Twitter  such allowed me to communicate with so many people around the world almost on a oneonone basis what is Chris Hadfield favorite color blue sort  a sky blue it's a nice place to be color around my eyes what awards because chris hadfield one how about a lot  awards  grade 8 I won the public speakg contest  my school  grade five I won the posture contest I was also the top test pilot at the US Air Force test pilot school  top test pilot  the US Navy the award that actually meant the most to me was as I was a test pilot they did this really complicated test to put a hydrogen burng enge for a hypersonic airplane out on the wg tip  an f18  I presented at the Society for experimental test pilots big annual conference  I won best project for for beg a test pilot for the whole world  that kd  opened the doors to get chosen as an astronaut your life sort  trundles long you'd hit a big watershed  after that everythg after is sort  the result  one moment  time or that might have been the one I'm most proud  one that had the biggest impact on my life anyway what is Chris Hadfield it's a little ty one what is Chris Hadfield Oh IQ I don't know but I actually when I was a teenager I was kd  you know secure like everybody  I wanted to jo Mensa the organization  people that were that had high enough IQs  it turns out when I did the Mensa test Mikey was high enough to jo Mensa but then once I jo Mensa I didn't really know what to do next but it at the time it seemed important all right what languages does Chris Hadfield speak I speak English  then I'm from Canada  so we teach French  Canada a donkey pollen food for a COC aid  then as an astronaut I wanted to be able to fly a Russian spaceship  work with Russians  so you never do Puerto sceetos yeah I speak a little bit  Russian a little bit  German but I've kd  forgotten all  it how to eat  space Chris Hadfield well your food floats for one thg so you don't need a plate like a plate would be useless so what you do is you get your package you either make it cold or hot  there's just like this little easy bake oven where you can warm up to package you can't really cook it might be dehydrated food  then you slide it over a needle  you dial  you push a button  it fills up the package the right amount  water now you've got your package  you mix it up  your velcro it to the wall let it sit soak up the water  then you carefully slid it open because if you open it quick you'll get like a little spooky stuff all over the room so you don't want that so you carefully open so nothg comes flyg out because nothg's gonna fall to the floor  then you get a spoon spoon is a great utensil  you want a a long spoon so we can go all the way to the back  the package  then you eat everythg out  one package you don't like have peas  meat  potatoes  corn you just eat all  your piece first  they have to be creamed piece they don't float all over  then you ball it up super tight because you have to get rid  your garbage put it  the garbage  then you open your next thg which might be I don't know or tortilla so that's how we eat  space one thg at a time  its package it's sort  like I don't know eaten on the bus or eatg on a campg trip or somethg here's a funny thg about beg  space  that is because there's no gravity that means that the stuff  your nose  your suses never dras so it's sort  like you always have a head cold you can't really taste your food as much you know  here like this your food all sort  tastes bl because you're not smellg it you're not gettg it  through all  your sensors so food  space taste sort  bl  the food that has the strongest spice naturally  it is shrimp cocktail because we've got cocktail sauce on which is you know a lot  horseradish now you wouldn't thk you would have shrimp cocktail  a spaceship filled with a nice red hot sauce on it you bite to it it's got that nice crunch  then you get that surge  eye waterg horseradish cocktail sauce  for a moment or two it clears your suses so my favorite space food was shrimp cocktail how to sleep  space Chris Hadfield first you have to decide when right because you're gog around the world sixteen times a day so when is it night it's night every you know 5 mutes  course you're gonna get a sunrise every 90 mutes so you have to cover all the wdows so the Sun doesn't get  your eyes  then you float to your little sleep pod  there's a sleepg bag tied to the wall with a strg you you float  carefully you float to your sleepg bag it's got arm holes  then you could zip up your sleepg bag  now you're just sort  loadg like a fish  an aquarium side your sleepg bag you pull the little doors closed on your sleep pod you turn the fan down as low as you can don't want to suffocate but make it quiet  then you shut f the light  then you relax every muscle  your body  your arms float up  your knees float  your butt waist bends  your head comes forward  your whole body's perfectly relaxed  you don't need a pillow  you never have to roll over your shoulder doesn't get sore it's like the most calm  comfortable sleep you've ever had  your life I thk if we start flyg tourists  space it's gonna be feel like the space spa the best sleep you've ever had how to meet Chris Hadfield hmm well let's see I speak all over the world I'm constantly travelg I've been millions  people I don't just hide so if you want to meet me you could go to my website Chris Hadfield CA I thk  see when I'm gonna be somewhere or you can send me a note we could eat meat I'm on Twitter  Facebook  Instagram  such you could write me a nice letter I'd love to get a letter from you  if you draw me a really nice picture I'll stick it up on my fridge how long was Chris Hadfield commer  the International Space Station about two or three months we take turns  we go up  a little spaceship or the Russian one the Soyuz pretty soon we'll be gog up  down on American ships built by Boeg  built by SpaceX but when I went we took turns there were new crews every three months so if you thk about it we rotate who's  charge every two or three months okay this is a big question at least you know physically how did Chris Hadfield contribute to space exploration well when you're the first to do thgs people notice because if say for example there'd never been a Canadian who was the mission specialist which was like a fully tegrated crew member on the space shuttle I was the first Canadian so that was sort  a big contribution for the 37 million people that live  Canada did a bunch  research while I was up there I helped run the 200 experiments on the space station I helped build two space stations that's kd  a you know with your hs kd  contribution but I was 's director  operations  Russia so I helped helped the space program across cosmos  Russia    the United States work  get along so I contributed there  I served as an astronaut for 21 years every sgle day for 21 years so that was that was a big contribution as well this question is unnamed it just has my name I can open it from right to left just for variety okay the first Canadian  space  now we have to choose the modifier was ah was Chris I'd field the first Canadian  space no the first Canadian space was Marc Garneau the second was Roberta Bondar the third was Steve McLane I was fourth fourth Canadian  space very proud did Chris Hadfield walk on the moon I never got the chance  we haven't had anybody walk  the moon sce I was 12 soon we will there are their astronauts trag right now   we're buildg hardware right now for people to not just walk  the moon but actually start settlg the moon start livg there just like we live  Antarctica or some  the more remote parts  the world so what's happeng so maybe I'll still get a chance to do what I dreamed about when I was a little boy okay here's the next question go to space with who did who did Chris Hadfield go to space with I went to space with Russians  German  Americans I thk but that's all just kd  arbitrary I went to space with people from Earth okay one more question here  the unnamed section  that is is Chris Hadfield okay yeah thanks for askg okay part  what happens  space though is a lot  thgs degrade  your body you lose part  your skeleton your muscles sort  waste away because there's no gravity that you have to fight so your body gets lazy your heart gets smaller your balance system gets confused because there's no gravity some astronauts  fact their eyeballs because  the change  the ternal fluid pressures  your body their eyeballs change shape so they see not as well after they've been  space but I've been back from space six or seven years now  my bones are dense my muscles are strong my eyeballs are okay everythg seems to be alright my balance systems good so yeah I'm okay Thanks so that's a lot  questions about me how about you have any questions about I don't know astronauts  general all right oh cool what astronaut here we go what are the requirements to be an astronaut that may be changg right now because with Elon Musk  Richard Branson  Jeff Bezos   other companies tryg to allow anybody who can buy a ticket to be an astronaut or at least to fly  space I thk that'll be good but up until now you had to kd  really be ready to fly a spaceship so if you want to fly a spaceship what are the requirements well you need to underst complicated thgs like orbital mechanics how do you maneuver  space how do you how do you make thgs accurately work how does a spacesuit work or the physiology  the human body or a little understg  solar physics  rocket propulsion systems  communication systems  beg able to reprogram the computers  plus it's an International Space Station so learn to speak some other languages  so there's a lot  requirements but the fundamental three thgs you need are number one a healthy body that fits  your spacesuit so not too big not too small  healthy number two the proven ability to learn complicated stuff so how do you know somebody can learn complicated stuff choose people with multiple university degrees who've proven that they can get a high score on a test or do origal research  then the third people who can make good decisions so we choose people who have had complicated jobs like test pilots  medical doctors life or death where people have run programs  my case to become an astronaut I didn't really know what to do I'm from a country that doesn't have very many astronauts but I looked at the astronauts  the world  the cosmonauts  I thought okay everybody needs a university education so I went to four different universities  I did it all  technical mechanical engeerg  I thought okay I need I look at you know Neil  Buzz  Sally Ride   everybody  they have good healthy bodies so okay I need to keep my body  shape so thk about what I eat  exercise a little bit  keep myself strong  then I thought astronauts fly  space you know that's a verb I can learn to fly I just have to do it so I started learng to fly when I was a teen I joed the Air Cadets they taught me to fly gliders  then powered airplanes  then I joed the Royal Canadian Air Force  flew a bunch airplanes eventually flew fighters as I was a sea f18 pilot  then I went to test pilot school but the US Air Force  then was a test pilot with the US Navy then Canada had an astronaut recruitment  they hired me to be an astronaut so so I guessed right I was a kid what is astronaut ice cream made  you've probably tried to ask for an ice cream it you bite to it  it sort  melts  your mouth  crumbles it's like a block  cotton cy I thk ice cream Western  ice cream is mostly made  sugar like whipped sugar the secret is we don't actually eat astronaut ice cream  space it's not really astronaut ice cream it's  Center ice cream because if you thk about when you bite to that astronaut ice cream it makes crumbs because it's that hard brittle sugary stuff  those crumbs would go everywhere without gravity they they'd be  your eyes you breathe them they'd be  the filters so it would be bad space food what is astronaut centrifuge when you fly a rocket ship because it's acceleratg through the atmosphere so hard with the big enges pushg you you could push back  your chair  you sort  get crushed by the force  this rocket F equals MA right force equals mass times acceleration we've got that big force  you're a mass so you're gettg accelerated  you feel that acceleration is like multiples  your own weight  the big rocket motors can crush you  your chair with like four or five times your weight  when you come back to the atmosphere  we're lettg the air slow us down you can get crushed like with eight times your weight which is really brutal but how do you get ready for that well what we do is we get  a little simulated spaceship  that's on the end  this huge arm  it sps us around  around  around until we're gettg pned agast the outside  this little thg  then we have to operate the spaceship  show we can do what we're supposed to do this thg is called a centrifuge dependg on on how you operate your capsule comg home if you mess it up  you're gonna pull a whole bunch  gee you're gonna crushed a lot  you have to wear the the result  your mistakes so it's a really good reforcg place to Tra what kd   do astronauts like astronauts come from everywhere we like all the  there is we actually disagree about  on board this astronaut likes  that has a melody that stays  your head  words that mean somethg  there's lots  astronauts who are ians we keep al struments up on the space station there's a guitar up there there's a ukulele there's a keyboard powered by batteries so when we're relaxg  the eveng or when it's somebody's birthday or when it's a holiday then we get together with the struments on board   play  it's just like you do on earth the next questions are where we're asked you're not where I thk it's gonna say do know where is where is astronaut trag astronaut trag for the United States is primarily at the Johnson Space Center  Houston Texas are just outside  Houston  then  Russia it's at the Yuri Gagar cosmonaut trag center but then we also tra  Canada at the Canadian Space Agency on the outskirts  Montreal  we tra  Europe  Germany at the European astronaut Center which is just outside  Cologne Germany  then also  Japan because it's an International Space Station so everyone's got their own trag  that one is  a little scientific trag town called scuba all around the planet where astronauts feel the atmosphere beg that's cool you're floatg weightless  space you turn your spaceship around backwards because you're gog around the world  this perfect circle  you fire your big enge for like maybe four mutes  it changes you're perfectly circular orbit to kd  like an oval where there's a low part nano  a high part  that low part  your oval starts to just touch the top  the atmosphere like like if you stuck your h out the wdow  the car not gog too fast you can just feel a little bit  air pressure but you're gog so fast where you're gog five miles a second so even a ty little bit  air really starts to slow you down  when you feel the top  the atmosphere the only way you can really feel it like is if you hold your checklist up  you let go  it  stead  just floatg  front  you it now starts to gently fall towards the floor everythg starts to behave like a feather  you're still kd  just hardly sittg  your seat that you're strapped to but with every passg second you start to see the effects  gravity more  more  we sort  really call atmospheric entry about four hundred thous feet up we call that entry terface that's where you start to feel the atmosphere beg  if you look out the wdows  the spaceship you can see that they're startg to get hot  as you come  it gets hotter  hotter  there's flames pourg all around until if you can image that you were somehow side a blast furnace  the red  yellow flames are rippg all around your ship as that that huge deceleration is causg all the friction  pressure  drag that's that's what the atmosphere does to you a little later but the early wispy atmosphere 00,000 feet where astronauts hang out huh at the space bar yeah stard jokes well we have to live near our trag equipment so most astronauts live close to the Yuri Gagar cosmonaut trag center  Star City Russia or the Johnson Space Center  Houston Texas there's a few obvious favorite places nearby to those space centers where where we go  the eveng there was one classic called the outpost which was close to the Johnson Space Center  it had all sorts  sort  contrab paraphernalia old astronaut pictures  sign pictures  stuff people had brought back from space  stuck to the wall  this crappy old firetrap  a buildg eventually the fire spector said now we you know we need to be grownup about this  the outpost got torn down but for a lot  years that's where the astronauts hung out at the outpost these next questions by popular dem started with why why astronauts never cry  space well it's not because we're not sad actually sometimes you cry because you're happy  what I found actually it's such a rich experience that my emotions were closer to the surface the whole time I found myself laughg  cryg way more ten than I do on earth but you can't really cry without gravity gravity pushes the weight  the tears down out  your eye well without gravity then the tears are not gonna get dra out  your eye  fact they're just gonna stay  your eye until you can't really see properly  then you need a hanky or somethg to dry your eyes now if you watch the movie gravity I thk when when Sra Bullock was cryg somehow her tears were propelled across the spaceship her tears were squirtg across the room I don't know anybody who cries like that  space tears don't fall why astronaut not use pencil  space that's not true we do we use pencils  space all the time pencils don't care where where gravity is you can write up you can write down you can write sideways so we use pencils all the time we use grease pencils because grease pencils are really tough we use sharpies sharpies work great ballpot pens don't work too well because you know take a pen  write upside down for a while if your pen won't write upside down like a lot  them do then it's not gog to be a good pen to use  a place where there's no gravity I don't have a Sharpie but if I did I would cross oh not why astronaut use pencil  space a little bit  a caveman phrasg but we use pencil  space because pencil work all right why do astronauts exercise  space beg  space is the ultimate lazy existence it's the ultimate place for a couch potato you don't have to fight gravity you don't have to lift a fger you don't have to hold your head up everythg just floats nothg sags it's a great place to be but as a result  the fact that you don't have to fight gravity you can be super lazy even your heart gets lazy because it it doesn't need to lift the blood from the bottom  your feet all the way up to the top  your head it just has to push it through your blood vessels your heart actually gets smaller your muscles would waste away you wouldn't have this big skeleton fightg gravity so your skeleton would dissolve so we have to exercise  space because we're comg home aga  we don't want to come back as like you know jellyfish so we exercise about two hours a day on the spaceship we have a stationary bicycle no seat because you don't need a seat it's more like I don't know a unicycle without a seat  then we have a treadmill that we can run on  there are big elastics that we wear on our hips  our shoulders to hold us down on the treadmill so we can run  pound away  then we have a resistive mache you can't lift weights because you're weightless so between the treadmill  the bicycle  the reason system exercise 2 hours a day you want to be conscious  your own sweat when you're weightless  so what we do is we keep a towel nearby  if you're good you can take the towel  just float it there  space next you  you workout for a while until you get  the sweaty  then you dry the sweat f  so your towel becomes sort  disgustg after a while  then you just velcro the towel to the wall  the sweat evaporates out  it it becomes humidity side the spaceship that's collected  the dehumidifier  it's turned back to drkg water  gettg onboard your sweat becomes becomes what you drk the next day yes long as you have a good purifier it works all right I came home the same weight is what I launched but with 20% less fat so 20% more muscle so it was good came back kd  ripped it was ok  my cardiovascular was good but I didn't keep the bone density up the bone density  my hips  my upper femur had I lost about eight  a half percent  my bone which is a lot  so you runng a big risk  breakg your hip when you get back until your body goes whoa I'm back on earth  starts to build dense bones aga why do astronauts go to the moon well so far only 12 astronauts have walked on the moon 2 astronauts have gone to the moon a lot  them just orbited it they didn't walk it's not like a lot  astronauts have kds  the moon but why do astronauts go to the moon we went because  May  1961 President John F Kennedy stood up  said we choose to go to the moon that's why we went it was a form  cold war between the United States  the Soviet Union it was pro that we could it was to challenge the the whole dustrial capability  the United States like why climb Everest challenge yourself see if he can do it make it part  who you are but now that we've done it why go back to the moon I thk now it's just like all exploration first prove that you can do it  then make it part  the experience eventually we'll go to the moon to stay  live just like everywhere else why do astronauts tra underwater how do you simulate beg weightless I mean sittg here  this chair I'm beg crushed down all the time so it's a lousy simulation  weightlessness now we could all ride  the back  an airplane  have the airplane push over  have us all sort  float for a second  the back or if you got the airplane gog like this if you could float for maybe 20 or 30 seconds  we do that because it's it's good for little short experiments but if you really want to Tra like for a an eight hour spacewalk you can't do it  little 20second segments so we decided a long time ago let's let's tra underwater  we'll use the buoyancy  the water  then the weight  the suit to balance out  then it's sort  like beg weightless it's not  course because if you go upside down  the water the blood still rushes to your head  you have the drag  the water movg through the water is way different than movg through the emptess  space it's it's like you image how big a normal Olympic swimmg pool is  then make it 5 feet deep that's what the space station swimmg pool trag pool is like we call it the neutral buoyancy laboratory all right how how astronaut how many astronauts have walked on the moon well it started with a Neil  Buzz it ended with Harrison Schmitt  jeans sermon Cernan so that's four  there were eight others  between Apollo 11 12 not 13 because they had problems  the weight  the moon 1 15 16  17 so 12 human begs have walked  the middle brave guys how astronaut communicate  space we talked to each other on board the spaceship  people are from all over the world so you have to choose a common language the majority  the International Space Station was built by englishspeakg people  russianspeakg people so on board we speak primarily English but lots  Russian to sort   a mixture  both is such as yoga voodoo Petroski but the Muslim will  the keep our genus Dancy so I had to learn to speak Russian because I was a member  a crew onboard the space station  the cosmonauts equivalently learned to speak English but that's just amongst ourselves we have to talk to earth so here's what you do you grab the microphone  the space station or you push a little transmit button on the wall  your voice goes through the air to a little microphone on the wall the microphone turns to an electric signal that then goes through the wires to a little digital thg that turns it to a digital signal  then that goes outside  the ship to a big antenna  we send it up to a geostationary satellite twenty you know two thous miles away from the earth  it collects that signal from us  then redirects it down to a great big dish antenna somewhere on the planet like the ones   New Mexico  then they collect that little digital fat signal  then they take that digital signal to send it through wires across the United States  it gets to the Johnson Space Center  Houston Texas where there's another little mache that takes a digital signal  turns it back to sort  a analog signal  then it comes through a wire up to a little speaker that shakes the same way that microphone did on the space station  moves the air molecules  they come across  goes to someone here  they hear you how long that takes depends on how far away we are sometimes we're on the other side  the world radio waves go basically at the speed  light 186,000 miles a second but that's still you know 186,000 miles it is the world is 25,000 miles around so if you got to go all the way out to 22,000  back aga  maybe even twice it can take a second or two so when I phoned my wife from the Space Station it would go through all  those lks  then get you know through the Houston telephone system  it would rg on her phone but the delay was so long that she'd pick it up  she'd go hello  I go hello but by the time she said hello  it got to me  I said hello back to her it might be three seconds  she always thought it was like a sales call  she'd hang up on me so she actually got the numbers from  so that stead  it comg up as some unknown number it would say space so her phone would say space Oh space is callg  then she'd wait for me to answer the next question is how astronaut come back to earth when you say how do you get back to Earth your real question is how do you slow down you don't want to hit the world at seventeen  a half thous miles an hour we don't have enough fuel to just like fire our rocket  slow down we couldn't brg that much fuel with us so we just used Frick we use the drag  the air to slow us down we just start to fall to the atmosphere  then once we're  the atmosphere it catches us  then we fly the spaceship as carefully as we can to not have too much drag or too much heat big s turns all the way down to let ourselves get aligned  then when we get close to the earth if your spaceship has wgs like the space shuttle then you can l it on a runway but if your spaceship is just a little capsule like a gumdrop then it would just suck to the world so we have a great big parachute or maybe two or three parachutes  then you can l  the water which isn't too hard you've done a bellyflop water can be hard but waters a little more forgivg than dirt or rock so you can l your spaceship  the water  then run the risk  it skg or you can have it l on l  if you're gog to l on l you can use airbags on the bottom  that's what Boeg is dog now or you can have little Rockets that just before you hit the ground they go perfect  fire so that it slows you down just before you hit the ground  that's what we did  my third spaceflight  the Soyuz has little little retro rockets to cushion you or as the Russian let's call them st lg rockets it's like Greenl or the Cape  Good Hope you don't believe the you know the sales pitch it's a pretty rough lg all right last questions how do astronauts poop I don't thk you're askg how we poop I thk it's how we use the toilet we poop like everybody okay I'm gonna get graphic here for a second how do you know when you have to poop on earth it's actually because  the weight  the poop side you tells you hey it's time to poop you know how sometimes you're lyg  bed  you're okay poetry to stup you go wow I really got a poop well if you're weightless  your body's not gonna tell you it's time to poop so you almost have to learn this new sort  fullness symptom that tells you it's time to poop you're countg on gravity because gravity is gog to pull it away from you  without gravity even when you're done poopg the there's the poops just gog to stay sort  stickg to you so we wear a rubber glove  sometimes you have to like physically separate the poop from your body but then takg the place  gravity to pull the poop down to the toilet is airflow we have air pulled down to the toilets got fans  it so  that works for the P as well so when you want to poop on the space station then you you wait till it's your turn  the toilet because there's a limited number  toilets on a spaceship two four six people go to the toilet it's look we have it's sort  like a little closed f area take your pants f completely because you don't want them floatg around when you're on the toilet  then you sit on the toilet  it's got you could either hook your toes under some toe loops so that you don't float f the toilet or on the Space Shuttle we had sort  like a little seatbelt thg that claimed like image wearg a seatbelt so you don't float f your toilet but you don't want to float f the toilet partway through it be a mess then you turn the toilet on great loudest thg on the spaceship because  all those big fans to pull the air down to the toilet  then you pee  poop just like you do everywhere  the pee goes down to a sewage system that has purifiers  filters  gets turned back to drkg water aga just like on earth except it's not quite as personal on earth  then your poop though goes down  gets pulled side a tank it looks like a big milk bottle on the space station when you're done we use wet wipes because you don't have a sewage system so you don't have to use toilet paper get yourself nice  clean everythg goes  there  then it goes down side the toilet  then you clean up for the next person you put the lid on the toilet  when the milkcan is completely full  poop then we seal it with these great big knurled knob dogs on the top so that none  the smell will come out then we store it down  sort  a cold storage area  this station  then when one  the unmanned ships comes up with all the food  supplies  scientific equipment  then we fill it with all  our garbage cludg our solid waste or our poop  we seal that up  then when it undocks it separates from the station   we fire it down to the atmosphere  then it it burns up  the atmosphere so the next time you wish on a shootg star thk about maybe what you're lookg at I'm Chris ad field thank you for beg part  my wired autocomplete exercise I hope you learned a few thgs about spaceflight  maybe a little bit about Chris Hadfield astronaut"

162,1.0,"(dramatic )   Boeg saga this past year is an example  how\nnot to hle a crisis.  A relatively small design issue that exploded to massive catastrophe.  y did not build \nmarg for human error.  This br new plane crashed twice  the span  about five months. How could this possibly happen?  How long has this plane\ngog to be grounded? Boeg says there\'s a fix. When is it comg?  Boeg was once held up\nto be the gold stard  engeerg excellence. And today it has lost\na lot  credibility.   737 MAX scal will\nchange aviation history like no other event  the\npast five or six decades.  [Narrator] Until relatively recently, Boeg\'s reputation among\npilots  passengers was second to none. Today, that faith has\nbeen significantly shaken as America\'s aviation\ngiant contues to reel from the fall out \ntwo devastatg crashes that killed 36 people.  MAX crisis has severely crippled the nation\'s biggest exporter. Exposed critical flaws  the relationship between the FAA  the\nbusesses it regulates. And raised serious questions,\nhow was this able to happen? Who is to blame,  what does this mean for the future  the aviation dustry? (dramatic ) In late 2018, thgs were\ngog pretty well for Boeg.  Before the first crash,\nBoeg thought  the MAX as a cash cow that\nwould keep on producg.  y were just breakg\nall sorts  records for revenue  airplane deliveries.  [Narrator] A global boom  air travel had helped the company\nearn record prits, which drove it\'s stock\nprice to new heights.  Problem prior to the crash for Boeg was that Boeg couldn\'t\nmake the MAX fast enough. We wrote about how Boeg was runng out \nparkg spots for the MAX.  [Narrator]  MAX\nis the latest iteration  Boeg\'s 737 aircraft, which first entered\ncommercial service  1968.  It\'s kd  the work\nhorse  Boeg\'s fleet if you\'ve kd  done any\nkd  medium length travel, domestically, you\'ve almost\ndefitely flown on a 737.  [Narrator] As times\nchanged so did the 737. Over the years, Boeg has\nupdated the jet dozens  times. l the while matag\nthe origal air frame. And this system worked well for Boeg.  737 is the most successful commercial airplane ever made. In 2017, 50 years after\nthe first 737 took f, Boeg was followg a\nlong established play book when it delivered one \nthe first 737 MAX eight\'s to a budget Indonesian\nairle called Lion Air.  [reader] An\nIndonesia passenger plane crashg to the sea\nmutes after take f.  [reader] 189 people on board.  [Narrator] On October 29th, 2018, a Boeg 737 MAX eight jet\ncrashed to the Java sea, killg everyone on board.  re are a bunch  questions\nthat immediately come up. A br new plane went\nto commercial service about a year before it crashed. That\'s unusual. What could have happened? Could there have been pilot error? Was there a matenance issue?  [Narrator] Some  the\nmost important reportg to come out after the crash was the story about an\nobscure piece  stware.  We were obviously tryg\nto underst thgs about this airplane  the\nsystems on the airplane,  so I went to a\naviation safety conference. One  the people we talked to was a pretty senior Boeg executive,  he acknowledged that\nthey never told pilots about the system. And essentially what\'s the big deal.  [Narrator] Boeg at the time argued that pilots didn\'t need to know about the existence  the\nautomated flight control system, who\'s name the public would\neventually learn was MCAS.  Well how can that be? How can there be somethg on a plane, not only that pilots\ndidn\'t fully underst  weren\'t traed on, but also just didn\'t know that it existed.  After the first crash I thk\nwe still didn\'t yet realize how big the story would become. (mellow )  [Narrator]  orig  the MAX scal has it\'s roots  the rivalry\nbetween Airbus  Boeg. Ever sce the 1990\'s the two companies have\nbeen locked  competition. By the 2010\'s the\ncommercial aviation market was essentially a stable duopoly, with each company controllg\nroughly half  the market. At the heart  this rivalry has long been each company\'s flagship commercial passenger plane. For Boeg, that aircraft is the 737, for Airbus, it\'s the A320. (dramatic ) In 2010, Airbus shook up the market when it announced the A320 Neo, an updated version \nthe A320 aircraft le. Neo planes wouldn\'t\njust be updated versions  a familiar aircraft, they\nwould also be cheaper to run.  Fuel efficiency\'s the\ntouchstone  anythg that airles do. I mean, if you talk about bean\ncounters  penny pchers, airles are the ultimate  those areas.  [Narrator] It\'s time to thk max.  Boeg did not design\na completely new plane from the ground up because\nit would have taken too long.  [Narrator] To make the MAX, Boeg took the existg 737 air frame  paired it with a new,\nmore powerful enge. But dog that changed\nthe plane\'s aerodynamics. One effect was that \nrare flyg conditions the aircraft\'s nose would pitch up. This is where the MCAS stware came . It was designed to automatically\npush the plane\'s nose down.  One former Boeg engeer\nwho didn\'t work on the MAX, characterized the stware\nfix as a b aid. We\'ve been learng for the last year how the b aid wasn\'t as\nstrong as Boeg needed it to be. (slow piano )  [Narrator] On March\n10th 2019, a second crash. This time  Ethiopia. l 157 people on board were killed.  [Male] I heard about the second crash.  When on Sunday morng.  I woke up  kd  rolled\nover  looked at my phone.  I got a text from an airle ficial,  it simply read, ""MAX eight"". I thought, how could this be, another one?  From the moment that\nthe second crash happened, we\'ve really thought or written\nabout almost nothg else.  Plane crashes \ngeneral are pretty rare. Plane crash with five\nmonths  each other, is pretty stunng. (dramatic )  This is unparalleled \nmodern commercial aviation. It doesn\'t happen.  [Narrator] A day after the crash,  an unprecedented move,\n grounded the MAX. Other nations quickly followed.   groundg the planes before the FAA had done\nthat was a huge deal,  it came as a huge\nsurprise to all  us.  Historically speakg,\nthe FAA has always been the, the leader that all the\nother countries followed.  [Narrator] This was the\nfirst time  aviation history that any nation\'s regulatory\nbody had overruled the FAA.  An emergency order  prohibition to ground all flights\n the 737 MAX eight.  [Narrator] Two days\nlater, the FAA relented  decided to ground the MAX. This marked the begng\n the agency\'s troubles, as the MAX crisis brought the regulator under creased scruty. In April, Boeg began to face\nthe fancial consequences  the scal.  then emerged that Boeg\nhadn\'t formed the FAA the warng system that\nhelped pilots diagnose an MCAS malfunction wasn\'t\nworkg as tended. Boeg\'s lack  transparency about MCAS was highlighted yet aga when a recordg emerged  a meetg.  [Michael] If you\'re\ngonna give us a system that we are gonna be affected by, it\'s hugely important that\nwe get briefed on what it is.  [Narrator]  story was\nbased partially on a recordg made about a month after the first crash, when a group  Boeg executives met with the American\nAirles pilot union. In the tape, the pilots\nconfront the executives, sayg they were not told\nenough about the plane.  [Michael] Most people say, ""If it a\'t Boeg, it a\'t go\'."" That\'s where most  us get that from because we thk we\'ve\nbeen dealt with honestly by the company. We\'re gettg told via the news media that you know what, the average pilot, that\'s a little bit too much formation for him to underst \nbe able to comprehend.  [Narrator] n  July it was revealed that after the first crash, the FAA had done it\'s own\nternal risk analysis  a potential second crash.  ir analysis showed that if the FAA  Boeg didn\'t do anythg  just kept the planes\noperatg as they had been, there would be 15 crashes\nover some two decades. That would make the 737 MAX\nthe most dangerous jet airler ever developed  the modern world.  What was gog on side Boeg? What was gog on side FAA? Did anyone discuss groundg the plane after the first crash?  A lot  questions have been raised about what the FAA\'s role was. Whether the agency was\nreally dog it\'s job  overseeg the design\n production  the MAX. You know, the FAA\ndelegates Boeg employees to do some  that oversight itself,  I thk some people\nhave questioned whether that has gone too far. You know, whether it\'s sort  the fox guardg the hen house. (mellow )  We set out to p pot the root cause  how Boeg created\na plane that crashes. We really tried to get to the heart  how they came to these decisions.  Why didn\'t they use two sensors? y only used one sensor  that is sort  a\nviolation  basic engeerg.  At the root  it Boeg made an credibly\nflawed assumption.  But they failed to recognize badly, that all these other emergency\nsignals would be confusg. Would make it very very\ndifficult for a crew to do the right thg\n a fast enough way.  [Narrator] Despite the tense scruty surroundg the MAX, at that time Boeg wasn\'t\nespecially forthcomg with formation about the plane.  I spent much  the summer\nknockg a lot  doors  the Seattle area, tryg\nto fd Boeg  FAA people who would help us underst\nhow all this happened. People would politely\nsay no, close the door, sometimes it was more  a\ndoor beg slammed  our face.  We went to, I thk it was\nsomethg like 200 houses, you know, drove 500 miles. It was really difficult to get people to agree to talk with us.  [Narrator] That fall,\nBoeg CEO, Dennis Muilenburg appeared before congress, where he was sharply\ncriticized by senators.  How did you not,  February, set out a ne alarm fire to say, we need to figure out\nexactly what happened.  We\'re not quite sure\nwhat Mr Faulkner meant by that exchange.  I thk it was widely thought that he did not perform\nwell  those heargs.  He survived two days \nreally tough questiong, but he was brutally wounded.  In conjunction with those heargs he sat down with family members\n a closed door meetg,  they sat there with large posters with photos  their loved ones. In one case, a family\nmember brought photos just  the cfs  his\nwife  his mother  law,  his three children,  he lost  he told the Boeg ficials, cludg Dennis Muilenburg, that he didn\'t feel they deserved to see his family members\' faces. In December, the company fally said, we can\'t keep makg these planes, we\'re gog to have to\nshut down our factory. And that has a huge ripple effect throughout the supply cha,  I thk, all  the relatively rosy projections that Dennis Muilenburg had been\nmakg throughout the year, fally it came to a head,  the board said enough is enough.  [Narrator] Less than a month\nlater, Muilenburg was fired.  It wasn\'t surprisg when\nMuilenburg was pushed out, it was more surprisg\nthat it took the board as long as it did to push Muilenburg out.  He wasn\'t visible. You know a question that came up a lot was ""Where is Dennis?""  [Narrator] In the new year, Boeg has contued to\ngrapple with the fall out from the MAX scal.  end  which doesn\'t\nseem to be anywhere  sight. On January 10th, Boeg released a batch \nternal communications.  y showed Boeg employees talkg about trickg regulators  say some really unflatterg thgs about the regulators that\nthey were dealg with.  It gives you a real glimpse\nto culture side Boeg.  [Narrator] It was\nthese ternal messages that likely led to\nBoeg\'s h beg forced to reverse their long held stance that pilots didn\'t need\nsimulator trag.  That is a stunng development.  We had been writg about\nhow gog back nearly a decade, Boeg had designed the MAX from the start to not require additional\nsimulator trag for pilots.  [Narrator] Flight simulators are highly specialized maches, built to tra pilots on the ground. One  the MAX\'s biggest sellg pots, touted by Boeg from the begng, was that the pilots who\nknew earlier 737 models, like the 737 NG, wouldn\'t need much more\ntrag to pilot the MAX. For years, Boeg assured\npilots, airles  regulators that pilots who knew the\nNG could easily fly the MAX after just a few hours\n trag on an iPad.  Requirg pilots to go\nthrough simulator trag before flyg the MAX\nsort  raises questions about the fundamental, you know, value proposition  the MAX. You know, what is the value  the MAX?  [Narrator] Sce March 8th  2019, Boeg\'s market value has\ndropped close to $112 billion.  re is an ongog\ncrimal vestigation by the justice department. re is a civil vestigation by the Securities  Exchange Commission. It is also the subject  quiries by the congressional law makers. It is also beg looked at by the Department \nTransportation  the FAA.  plane is still on the ground. Perhaps most important\n all, 36 people died.   MAX saga shows\nthat there\'s somethg that needs to be reassessed\n that whole system. It\'s time to take a breath.

163,0.0,"good morng pleasure to be with all  you pleasure to be back on Long Isl let me troduce the participants we have here today from my far left dr. Jim elantris from Empire State College to my immediate left Michael Dowlg who needs no troduction  this facility but Michael Dowlg worked for 12 years with Governor Mario Cuomo who I believe was the best governor to serve  the history  the state  New York I may not be objective on that 12 years with Mario Cuomo was a long 12 years when you worked with my father those were dog years when you worked with Mario Cuomo so 12 years Michael basically ran the health care system for the state  New York  developed the health care system durg that time then went now runs northwell health system which is the largest hospital system health system  the state  he's been extraordarily helpful here  dealg with this virus  he's gog to be even more helpful as we go forward so it's a pleasure to be with him to my right Melissa the rosa secretary to the governor  to her right dr. howard Zucker will you all know who's our commissioner  health who's been dog a great job pleasure to be here today this is one  the most challengg times that this state has faced  modern history challengg time all across the nation a lot  questions a lot  anxiety a lot  opions out there everybody has an opion everybody has a watch the news talk to people everyone has an opion on what we should be dog everyone has thoughts that they want to share one  the thgs that makes me frustratg for my team as I say that's I'm terested  your opion I'm terested  your thoughts but let's start with facts first right  then once we agree on facts then we can get to opions  thoughts  beliefs but let's start with fat  that's what I've been dog for the people  the state  New York let me give you facts our total hospitalization rate is down aga you see this curve we talked about it on the way up which was a paful journey we talked about it at the quoteunquote apex which turned to more  a plateau  flatteng  now we're seeg it gradually decle we would have liked to see a steeper faster decle but this is where we are  it's a pafully slow decle but it's better than the the numbers gog the other way you see it on total hospitalizations you see it on tubations  you see it also  the number  new cases per day this is important because while we're seeg that hospitalization rate go down  you see the number  new cases gog down those number  new cases are still problematic right so it means 600 new cases yesterday with everythg we've done we still have 600 new cases yesterday either walkg  the door to hospitals or people who are  hospitals who were then diagnosed with Kovac but that number is also gog down one  the most stubborn situations  the most distressg or the number  deaths  that is down from where we were but it's still 232 yesterday which is an unimagable  paful reality that we have to deal with  when people talk about how good thgs are gog  the decle  the progress that's all true it's also true that 232 people were lost yesterday  that's 232 families that are sufferg today also a caution  the number  deaths I know the reporters  everyone likes to trace these numbers  document these numbers I thk we're gog to fd when all is said  done that the numbers are much different than we actually thought they were the amount  formation that is now comg out that changes what we believed or what we were told happens almost on a daily basis this was a virus virus that started   now last week the CDC says oh it didn't come from  it actually came from Europe to the East Coast that's how it got to New York  that's how it got to Chicago etc that by the time we turned f travel from  the  travel ban the virus was already gone  it was  Europe  then it came here from Europe  we didn't know at the time so February March flights were lg people comg from Italy from the  etc they were brgg the virus we didn't know they're now sayg that the virus may not have come just  February March the virus may have come late last year they're dog testg  Chicago now on people who passed last November  December to see if they passed from the kovat virus so I thk this is all gog to change over time so a note  caution  I thk it's gog to be worse when the fal numbers are tallied we're also not fully documented all the athome deaths that may be attributable to coal pit so I thk that the reality is gog to be actually worse but there's no doubt it's a time  unprecedented anxiety stress people want answers people want answers now haven't had a paycheck they don't know where their job is they don't know if they're gog back to work where they're gog back to work when they're gog back to work  they want answers now  I underst that fully but before we look for answers let's make sure we're all understg the same question right  the question here is not do we open or reopen the society when do we reopen  we have to reopen the society you askg when do you start breathg you have to right the economy must function people need comes the economy has to work state needs revenues people have to be able to live their lives you have to be able to get out  the house you have to be able to see friends you have to be able to see family so it's not a question  do we reopen it's a question  how we reopen that's really the question that we have to grapple with  that we're dealg with  New York our position  New York is the answer to the question how do we reopen is by followg facts  data as opposed to emotion  politics right everyone has emotion I want to go back to work today I'm gonna go see my family today I want to be able to go to a bar  have a couple  drks  socialize with my friends today I do by the way but it's not about emotion it's not about political position on reopeng there's a Democratic position an position this virus kills them across ans there's no politics to this deal with facts  deal with data  use that to struct you even more important at a time  high emotion underst the emotion appreciate the emotion but deal on the facts  the data  you have it you can calibrate by the number  hospitalizations the fection rate the number  deaths the percentage  hospital capacity the percentage that you're fdg an antibody test the percentage  fdg on diagnostic tests positive negative you're collectg tracg data make your decisions based on the formation  the data that's what we're sayg  New York that that actually works  by the way we know it works when you look there's a chart today that was published by the New York Times you look at what's happeng  New York yes our our le is gog down our number  cases is gog down we have turned the corner  we're on the decle you take New York out  the national numbers the numbers for the rest  the nation are gog up they are gog up to me that vdicates what we're dog here  New York which says follow the science follow the data put the politics aside  the emotion aside what we're dog here shows results the hospitalization rate is down the number  deaths is down  the number  new cases is down for me I've been focusg on this number  new cases that's where our health pressionals are focused why because with everythg we've done close schools close busesses everybody shelter at home all the precautions about wear a mask wear gloves etc you still have 600 new cases that walked  the door yesterday week before that we still saw 1,000 new cases every day where are those new cases still comg from because we've done everythg we can to close down how are you still generatg 600 new cases every day where are they comg from aga let's look at the facts let's look at the data let's underst  see what we can do so what we've done over the past few days is we ask hospitals look at just those new cases who are comg  right yesterday 600 new cases where are those people comg from  what can we learn from those people to further target  refe our strategy when you look at where they're comg from they're primarily comg from downstate New York which is not surprisg basically equally distributed Long Isl is is 18 percent so that's a number that jumps out at you Rockl  Westchester which is where we did have a problem that's down to 11 percent when you look at the racial breakdown  who's gettg hospitalized you see it's disproportionately morities disproportionately African American  Lato aga  downstate New York higher percentage male 528 we don't know exactly why but the virus doesn't discrimate generally  a very high percentage comorbidities which is what we've been talkg about  which we underst which is not a surprise this is a surprise overwhelmgly the people were at home where there's been a lot  speculation about this a lot  people aga had opions a lot  people have been argug where they come from  wherever we should be focusg but if you notice 18 percent  the people came from nursg homes less than 1% came from jail or prison two percent came from the homeless population two percent from other congregate facilities but 66 percent  the people were at home which is shockg to us disproportionately older but by the way older starts at 51 years old I'm a little sensitive on this pot but if older starts at 51 years old then that's a large number  us old folk  this  this state   this country so that whole vulnerable population beg old well old is now 51  up so thk about that sixty to seventy twenty percent seventy to eighty neteen percent but fiftyone years old is old okay  I am very old transportation method we thought maybe they were takg public transportation  we've taken special precautions on public transportation but actually no because these people were literally at home 2%  car services 9% were drivg their own vehicle only % were takg public transportation 2% were walkg eighty four percent were at home literally were they workg no they were retired or they were unemployed only 17% workg so that says they're not workg they're not travelg the predomantly downstate predomantly mority predomantly older predomantly nonessential employees  that's important we were thkg that maybe we were gog to fire fd a higher percentage  essential employees who were gettg sick because they were gog to work that these may be nurses doctors transit workers that's not the case  they were predomantly at home so now that's only three days that's just about a hundred hospitals 1,000 people but it reforces what we've been sayg which is much  this comes down to what you do to protect yourself everythg is closed down government has done everythg it could Society has done everythg it could now it's up to you are you wearg the mask are you dog the h sanitizer if you have younger people who are visitg you  may be out there  maybe less diligent with the social distancg are you stayg away from older people over there startg at 51 by the way  but it comes down to personal behavior this is not a group that we can target with this formation it's really about personal behavior another issue that we're lookg at  we're tryg to underst  what is happeng  these hotspot clusters that you see poppg up you see it happeng across the country  meat plants where you have a significant number  people gettg fected  there's now a meat shortage  the nation well we have a hot spot  New York State we have a hot spot  upstate New York Madison all night at counties  it's around an agricultural busess but it's not a meat processg plant it's actually a greenhouse farm  we have dozens  cases comg from the employees  this situation so what does that tell you well it's not really about meat or vegetables right there's nothg about the fact that it was a meat processg plant because we have a vegetable processg plant it is about worker density  large gathergs that's the caution flag here that's an the message it's not about poultry it's not about me it's not about vegetables it's when you run a facility with a large number  workers  a dense environment  we learn that already  New York when we had the New Rochelle hot spot which was the first hot spot  the nation New Rochelle Westchester  the lesson was one or two people fected who go to a large gatherg or a dense gatherg that virus just takes f on you  we learned that  New Rochelle they're learng it aga  meat processg plants  poultry processg plants across the nation  we just went through it aga   we're gog through it now  Madison  Oneida County so that's somethg that we have to watch  keep  md also at the same time that we're gog through this reopeng exercise I want to make sure we don't miss the opportunity  the moment  the opportunity  the moment is that we went all through this let's learn the lessons  let's take this moment  history to actually improve from where we are  to build back better I want to set the bar high  set the goal  not just replacg what we did okay everybody go back to where we were I don't want to say that we spent all this time all this pa all this sufferg lost all these deaths only we'll go back to where we were go back to a better place how do you take how do you fd the silver lg  this viral storm  actually improve your situation we're on Long Isl we were through superstorm sy was horrendous thouss  people displaced but we learned  we built back better Long Isl is better for havg gone through Hurricane sy well how can you say that because it's a fact we learned we improved from a horrendous situation well how do we do that here  that's part  what we want to do you know people talk about makg changes  society change is very hard to make change is hard  your own personal life right how many New Year's resolutions did we make as a society that are still  effect here  May right I was supposed to lose five pounds I was supposed to be runng every day I was supposed to never lose my temper forget it one week maybe ten days for the temper the but history does show that people are ready for change at certa moments  I believe this is one  those moments like the superstorm sy like a 911 like we've seen after natural disasters around the country where people say I get it  I'm ready to make changes  that's what we want to do  that's what we talk about when we say look it's not just about reopeng it's about rebuildg it's literally about reimagg  movg the state forward at this moment  we want to do that how do we come up with a better transportation system how do we have more social equity  society a better safety system better housg better economy better education better health care system  we need the best mds available to take this moment to put together with the best thkg that we can fd to make the best improvement one  the lessons is  public health  our hospital system we worked  an impossible situation when this started we were told that we may need 130,000 hospital beds for kovat that was the itial projections we only have 50,000 hospital beds  the state how do you get 50,000 hospital beds to a 130,000 capacity it was impossible  by the way we don't really have a public health system we have separate hospitals all across the state but they don't really function as one system they never really work together on a day to day basis they don't share patient load they don't share PPE how do you do that  we scrambled  we made it work but now how do we stitutionalize that  how are we ready for the next Co vid or the next whatever it is how do we use telemedice better how do we better you allocate our health resources how do we harden the healthcare system but let's take the lessons we just learned  stitutionalize it  we've asked Michael Dowlg to do that he was a big part  the scramble that we went through to make it work  northwell was a leader it's the largest   my opion the most novative but now how do we take that  stitutionalize it so we don't have to go through this aga so next time somethg like this happens we can just open a book  it says here's what we do step a step B step C  we want to thank Michael for his service with that  he'll be workg with dr. Zucker from the Department  Health another area is education we went to remote learng overnight that's what happens when you close the schools okay all the students go home we're gonna go to remote learng well what is remote learng  we weren't really ready for it we had all talked about it thought about it there was some but we were not really prepared to do it we then had to do it we implemented it  God bless the teachers  this state they did a phenomenal job  God bless parents who had to figure out quickly how to use computers  technology  zoom this  zoom that but how do we really learn those lessons  we went to Bill Gates  he's gonna work with us on reimagg the education system  I want to thank him very much how do you create a testg  tracg system by the way what is a testg  tracg system right we never did this before well we have to take thouss  kovat tests antibody tests diagnose diagnostic test  then we have to trace have an army  tracers to do this we're dog it for the first time ever but how do we learn  stitutionalize it yes we have to do this for Kovac but we're not gog to go through all  this trouble  then just forget it this will happen aga some people say this virus comes back  the fall or the wter or there'll be another health emergency but Michael  has generously said that he would work with us  use his philanthropy to develop that testg  tracg  then on a larger scale how do we really use new technology  the economy  tomorrow  that's the lesson that we're all learng right work from home telemedice tell it's all about technology  a better use  technology  really corporatg the lessons to that  the probably the best md  this country if not  this on the globe to do this is I believe a true visionary especially  the field  technology  that's Eric Schmidt who was former CEO  Google obviously  just saw a future that no one else envisioned  then developed a way to get there  we've asked him to come work with us to brg that kd  visionary aspect to government  society let's look at what we just went through let's anticipate a future through that lens  tell us how we can corporate these lessons  mr. Schmidt who has tremendous dems on his talent  his time has agreed to help us  had an effort to do this Eric thank you so much for dog this  thank you so much for beg with us well thank you Thank You governor you have been dog an credible job for our state  frankly for the nation  I'm really pleased to help the first priorities  what we're tryg to do are focus on telehealth remote learng  broadb we can take this terrible disaster  accelerate all  those  ways that will make thgs much much better the solutions that we have to come up with have to help the people most  need people are  different situations throughout the state we need to consider all  them  not take one or the other so the tent is to be very clusive  make this thg better we need to look for solutions that can be presented now  accelerated  use technology to make thgs better my own view is that these moments are a chance to revisit thgs that are not gettg enough attention  we have systems that need to be updatg  need to be reviewed my commitment is to make this period  this sort  awful period to be a period as you described  Long Isl where New York State New York City everyone comes out stronger the publicprivate partnerships that are possible with the telligence  the New Yorkers is extraordary it needs to be unleashed you are the person to help us do that we are already where we're all  we are New Yorkers so we're aggressive about it  we're ambitious about it  I thk we get it Eric you know we went through this period  we realized that change is not only imment but it can actually be a friend I've done the right way  I hope that when we look back on this time we talk about all the pa or the sufferg but we also say it was a moment  time where we came together  we brought a creative aspect  an novative aspect  we work together  ways we never did before  we made this place a better place  I can't thank you enough for dog it Eric thank you very much I look forward to contug the conversation  workg together mr. Schmidt thank you yes thank you God thank you that is excitg last pot today is ional Nurses Day as you know nobody knows better than New Yorkers how our nurses really stepped up with our health care pressionals you know when the pressure is on  our lives you wd up seeg the best  the worst  people  heroes rise to the occasion  that's what we saw  the state  New York our frontle health care workers were just extraordary showg up every day workg impossible hours virus that nobody understood fear  fection but they just kept risg to the horizon to the occasion  that's why New York  the nation just loves all our health care workers but our nurses especially have done a phenomenal job  we thank them from the bottom  our hearts  JetBlue had a beautiful idea  a way to say thank you which is donatg roundtrip flights to 100,000 medical personnel  nurses to honor their efforts isn't that a beautiful thg 10,000 to New York medical pressionals Michael darlg doesn't is not eligible for that situation but other than that because we need him here  New York but it's a nice way that JetBlue is sayg thank you  all  us will fd our own way to say thank you but I'm sure every New Yorker jos me  sayg thank you thank you thank you from the bottom  our heart  to all the nurses who are here today god bless you  thank you for gettg us through this  thank you for beg New York tough which is not just tough but smart  discipled  unified  lovg god bless you questions yes about reopeng so along the way you've rubberstamp some thgs that you could say make common sense like golf courses you know you were asked about drive theaters you said hey that might be a good idea so if a busess owner right now says I have a super creative way to do this I can do it immediately  be safe you talk about smart New Yorkers telligent Yorkers do you trust that  you move forward with other thgs yeah piecemeal yeah we have we have a very detailed reopeng plan with very detailed steps I touch on it  what we just talked about we look at different regions  this state because there are different situations  different regions right New York City is different along that's different than the Adirondacks is different than Buffalo New York  the numbers are just dramatically different the way we talk about  this nation states are  different places  this state regions are  different places that's how big this stadium is how diverse it is so there are specific factual data pots that each region has to assess our is your fection rate gog up or is it gog down or your hospitalizations gog up or your your hospitalizations gog down do you have healthcare capacity if god forbid that fection rate takes f on you do you have the hospital capacity to deal with that do you have the ICU beds to deal with it you have the PPE if yes to those questions then  that region workg with the local ficials what busesses do we reopen  the analysis there is busesses that are most essential  pose the lowest risk should go first construction jobs because construction jobs especially exterior construction jobs workers are basically socially distanced by the nature  the work  can wear masks gettg their construction dustry up  runng aga manufacturg  a manufacturg settg where you can do social distancg right the meet plants are a caution flag the poultry plants are a caution flag the agriculture farm upstate is a caution flag not manufacturg where you have density  people three feet from each other on a factory le because that's a problem but manufacturg where you can socially distance  then you can even go busess by busess drive theater where an employer says this is how I'm gog to operate it everybody stays  the car nobody gets out  a car you can make those decisions  both stores you can say maybe a laundromat know is that we get to that pot  we have the steps where you go through the data because first  all you want to make sure you have the you want to make sure you have the virus on the treat right you want to make sure you're not still seeg that virus like fire through dry grass  we do have the virus on retreat all across the state different levels  retreat  different parts  the state but it is on retreat  all parts  this state which is dramatically different than the numbers for the nation which is worth notg you have states that are openg where you still are  the cle I thk that's a mistake do you thk by cuttg the Advantage program you bear some responsibility for New York City's spike homeless creased fundg for homeless all across the board local governments then decide what the best programs are for that locality it's different or not so different  Suffolk different  New York City but we've creased fundg dramatically exponentially  so it's not just a question  fundg it's how you use that fundg  I've worked on the homeless issue sce I was  my 20s first I render notforprit I was the largest notforprit provider for homeless families  the United States then I went the federal government I worked on homeless programs all across the country I've been  more homeless shelters homeless programs  probably any other elected ficial so it's it's not just money it's you have to know what you're dog  you have to have a program that makes sense you'll what are you dog to make sure that healthy boards  elections are able to hle what will likely be a very large flux  absentee ballots  protect poll workers who still must be there look the best we can do you still have to run elections the court said we have to run elections I don't thk it's a good idea to have people go stg on le to vote you shouldn't say to a person if you want to exercise your civic duty you have to endanger your public health  possibly endanger others we've seen video  other elections held across the country we have people waitg on le six feet apart to vote I mean that that made no sense to me so to the extent we can do absentee ballots  make that available to everyone  mail them out to everyone  make that easy I thk that is the best way if we have to also have an election day where people show up on Election Day my two cents to people is please vote by absentee ballots so you don't have to show up but then if they have to show up they have to socially distance etcetera are you dog anythg to make sure that the boards  Elections around the state are able to hle what you are askg them to yeah well we're workg with all the local boards  Elections I've not heard from any Board  Election that says they can't send out the ballots we told them last week they have to will send out prestamped forms that people can just send right back  I haven't heard any issues from any local boards  Elections have you heard we're workg closely with the local County Board  Elections as well as the heads  the Democratic  an Party to make sure everyone has confidence  how the elections are beg held there's a very real possibility that certa elections won't be called on election night that is a reality people should prepare for because as you said the hope is the majority  the people are gog to be mailg  their absentee ballot  so we want to make sure that the countg process is done right  it's thorough  that people contue to have confidence  faith  democracy  so that may mean that certa elections are called a couple  days afterwards to make sure the counts are done properly  terms  helpg to support the county boards  Elections one  the thgs we've discussed ternally if it's somethg that they need is supplementg with the ional Guard  seeg if the ional Guard can step   help where we know that they met that there may be issues but it is somethg that we're focused on  contug to talk to the county you're not beyond my paygrade on formation so I'm gog to refer the question to dr. circle but just for what I know  what I believe I said the origally we were told the virus came from  right  everythg was stopped the virus from    travel ban CDC comes out last week  says oh no it didn't come from  it came it went from  to Europe  then from Europe to New York which is a dramatically different situation because we were sittg here  New York February March watchg   the federal government came   they were all our airports screamg everybody from  nobody screamed people comg from Europe  now it turns out there were like two million people who came from Europe durg that time  they led at JFK they led it  the werk Airport someone to Chicago that's where the flights go  then they just mixed to society  then you have New York which is one  the most dense communities  the country  the virus took f nobody said it was comg from Europe right we people visitors from Europe work walked right through the airport nobody said two New Yorkers be careful if you just with somebody who came from Italy be careful they may have the virus nobody said that so it was totally new I can't speak to the East Coast stra versus the West Coast reign on the antibodies that was an itial thought that if you had gotten the virus  you had the antibodies that you would be immune to another fection I thk that's now beg questioned but aga you're beyond my paygrade Thank You governor so what the CDC is dog   others are lookg at is the genetic fgerprtg  this virus to try to figure out the differences between whether it's those came from   from Italy  unfortunately all the formation is not out yet about how this has whether it's mutated what's the difference  these viruses  the severity  the virus as to whether a one stra would be worse than another regardg the antibody issue as the government said itially the feelg was that one has antibias they should be protected but we contue to learn more about this virus every day  there are little thgs we're gog to learn more about is the protection from when you have antibodies  what that means  also for how long that protection would last if one is protected from that so it is a great question  it's hard to give you an answer at this pot right now because there's still more research to do today  someone from Illois did they thk the virus may have come last December or November so they're lookg at autopsy reports to see if it should have been a cause  death last year which to me is just a wakeup call that you know we thk we know what we know but nobody knows nobody knows I mean look at all the revisions that are now gog on about all the facts that we thought we knew January durg march the elder named Milan does not seem close to meetg all the necessary criteria even laggg behd the city on one key data pot why is that  along with that the contact tracg seems to be a big challenge  yesterday the Nassau County Executive said that there's gog to be this stware for the contact tracg system isn't gonna be onle for four weeks what role does that play   reopeng yeah the one  the new systems that we have to develop here is everybody talks about test trace isolate we have to do thouss  tests by the way we've already done 1 million tests  this state this state is brought testg onle faster than any state  the country  we now do more tests per capita than any country on the globe  New York so we've been very aggressive  successful at brgg testg onle but we have to have testg  every region Long Isl New York City upstate different regions upstate  then an army  tracers you're talkg about thouss  tracers who take every positive call up every positive who did you go to dner with who did you whatever  then isolate those people  you have that facilities to isolate people who can't be isolated some people can't be isolated at home so that has to be  place  every region we are workg with regions to get that up  runng but you have to have you have to have the virus on the decle  then you have to have a way to monitor that virus  that's testg  tracg I don't know about the counties stware system I don't know if Jim knows we spoke I spoke to the county executive last night  that is one issue that we're workg with the county on is the testg  tracg the other piece that I thk you refer to as the gross hospitalizations new people comg  the door which is a sort  concern  new fections the data that the governor mentioned today where are people comg from what are their demographic formation who are they will help ice delete  target better for people  regions to say here's a hotspot zone to get that fection rate down so this will help long isl  other regions target better where the fections are comg from to lower that overall fection rate which will help  the reopeng process as we go forward  that's what Michael  is helpg us with puttg together this tracg testg program aga it's never been done before on this scale we have to do it now  then we actually want to keep it stitutionalized because I don't believe this is the last time that we're gog to go through this I thk this is part  the overall new normal you know we're seeg storms we never saw before we've seen changes  the environment changes  weather patterns  I thk this is gog to be it's the first real public health emergency that we've had on this scale but I would not believe that this is the last time we go through it so I thk learn the lessons  stitutional distance not  this city because we're on Long Isl here but  these let's call it  this city  this city when you're on Long Isl this city is New York City although there are many cities  the state the social distancg is important the enforcement  social distancg  wearg a mask is left up to the local governments  the local governments have discretion  how to enforce it  obviously it should be enforced  a nondiscrimatory nonselective way but I thk it's important that it is important that people socially distance it's not I thk I know it's important that people socially distance I know it's important that people wear a mask I know masks are now even believed to be more important by health care experts than the itially were that they can be more effective  it is so easy relatively  the scope  thgs to wear the mask I mean look we're at north well look at what the people here at north well just went through for the past two months to save lives  we're askg people wear a mask so you don't spread the fection compared to what people have gone through they don't want to wear a mask no that's not who we are it's not what we are we're part  a society we underst we're responsible one for another wear the mask I don't even have a good lookg mask  I wear it I have this very pla borg white ugly mask but with this face it doesn't make a difference thank you very much guys"

Tom Frieden president  CEO  resolve to save lives  former director  the Centers for Disease Control  Prevention the CDC from 2009 through 2016  dr. Caitl rivers senior scholar at the Johns Hopks Center for Health security an assistant pressor  the department  environmental health  engeerg at the John Hopks  School  Public Health dr. Frieden  his testimony will provide a perspective based on 30 years  fightg epidemics cludg leadg the CDC's response to Ebola  where we are  what we need to do to protect Americans dr. rivers makes the case why  the months  years to come will we need additional capacities  diagnostic testg contact tracg  the health systems to combat the virus I'm also so glad to have my colleagues here I want to thank them for beg here this morng on the Democratic side congresswoman Kathere Clark Cheri Bustos bonnie watson coleman  on the an side Congressman Tom Cole congressman y Harris  I hope we will have congresswoman Jaime Herrera Butler we are all disappoted that others could not be here because  distance reduced flights  the health issues raised by the House physician chairwoman Nita Lowey rankg member Kay Granger congresswoman Lucille roybalallard Barbara Lee Lois Frankel  congressman congressman mark Pocan John Molenaar  Tom graves they could not attend but they did send questions which we will ask on their behalf but I want to underscore that members should not be blocked from participatg  the committee's heargs all committee members should be heard  that requires movg as quickly as possible to the 21st century  conduct virtual heargs every member should be able to participate I am angry that the White House mismanaged America's reaction to the pemic  the president has done everythg he could to avoid accountability I'm particularly upset about the lack  the necessary testg  the personal protective equipment capacity both  which could help us to ga control  then yesterday President Donald Trump told reporters that he would not permit dr. Anthony Fauci to testify before the Democratic House committee because  that quote the house is a bunch  Trump haters quote they frankly want our situation to be unsuccessful but they are allowg dr. Fowler to testify before the US Senate next week this is a bipartisan panel dr. Fauci has appeared before our subcommittee dozens  times he has testified whether it was a democratic or a an chair he has testified hundreds  times on Capitol Hill workg with Democratic  an presidents yet now the White House said no maybe no doubt it he's just frightened  oversight the labor HHS subcommittee provided billions  dollars  fundg for the CDC the NIH the ional strategic stockpile hospitals  Barda we have appropriated 175 billion dollars for hospitals  other health care providers most recently twenty five billion dollars to exp testg  improve Diagnostics cludg 11 billion dollars for state  locality testg capacity the purpose  today's hearg is to get a cleareyed view  the path forward for respondents to covet 19  the near term as we work to mitigate the spread  the coronavirus  the medium turn as we develop the therapeutics to treat the disease  a vacce to oculate millions  Americans agast the corona virus   the long term as we make vestments to enhance our nation's public health  global health systems to better prepare for the next pemic over the horizon these are the three pillars we will look to build  today's hearg I would like to explore the recommendations  our true public health experts on the necessary measures that must be put  place  the benchmarks that must be met to move forward while keepg Americans safe science  facts must drive our policy  that dems hearg from doctors scientists researchers  experts who comm those facts  drive science to public policy it is urgent that we do so disease modelers predicted accordg to the New York Times   Washgton  that  the comg months 3,000 Americans could die every day there is no time to delay our witnesses today will give us the analysis the facts the science  the strategy that will help us to make the right decisions with that I would like to recognize my good friend the rankg member  the committee for any openg remarks that he would like to make thank you madam chair  I make a few extemporaneous remarks before I get to my prepared remarks first I just want to really thank you for holdg this hearg I thk it's a very important hearg to to have  I want to thank all my colleagues that were able to make the trip here we all underst why others couldn't but I really appreciate each  you on both sides  the aisle for for comg  I want the record to show I joed the chairman urgg that dr. Fauci be allowed to testify here I thk it would have been good testimony useful to this committee I thk useful to this country frankly I thk gog forward this subcommittee probably more than any other is gog need admistration employed expert put as we make the important decisions  front  us  while I'm not naive enough to believe that there's not a certa amount  partisanship on Capitol Hill  some communities are more partisan than others frankly the Appropriations Committee  general  particularly this subcommittee are not hyper partisan committees  my view  the record chosen  the last five years workg together on this subcommittee  with our friends  the United States Senate particularly senator blunt senator Murray you know we've creased NIH fundg by 39 percent we've creased CDC fundg by 2 percent we've creased the strategic stockpile fundg by 3 percent we've established the fectious disease Rapid Response Fund I thk that's a bipartisan record  accomplishment to be proud   I don't thk  retrospect we've all wish we had done more but the reality is we are so much better f where we're at because  the actions taken  the bipartisan sense by this committee so it's record shows that it knows how to work together I just note for the record my friend the chairman when I was chairman that voted for fal passage  the bill every sgle time we negotiated got to a place where you could agree  she helped me get it across I was able to do the same thg with her when she was last year assumed the chairmanship  I hope that's the way we can contue to work gog forward so aga I thk we're gog to be called upon to make some really important decisions  havg read the testimony both dr. rivers  dr. Frieden you know a lot  that is gog to call for sustaed vestment  the public health sector frankly I thk it's gog to call for us lookg at the caps agreements on some  these accounts as well I don't thk you can probably get to where we need to go with a cap so we need the the put which I know our two witnesses here today will will give us  aga I look forward to workg with every member  this committee  particularly with you madam chair I'd say arrive at the right decisions for all our country gog forward so without aga I want to thank you too for the any calls  briefgs that you've held over the past few weeks to keep all  us updated on efforts to overcome this pemic over the last several weeks the spread  Kovan 19 has caused unthkable disruptions to life as usual  it will contue to do so for some time even as we flatten the curve followg the unprecedented stra on our healthcare systems  the devastatg economic hits to hardworkg Americans as a direct result  this coronavirus desire for normalcy to return is certaly a sentiment shared by us all but a state  local economy slowly  cautiously began to reopen it's important to remember that gettg back to busess does not yet mean gettg back to normal even though the fight agast Kovan 19 is far from over keepg busesses closed  workers at home it's not a sustaable option for the long term while the federal government has provided some shortterm relief to help dividuals households busesses  communities stay afloat durg this period  extreme social distancg our economies need to get movg aga  Americans need to get back to work however any such efforts to reopen must contue to keep the health  safety  Americans at the top  md  not undo previous progress  slowg the spread  coronavirus this will deed be a balancg act until there are workg treatments effective therapeutics  ultimately a vacce to control Co with 19 the risk  the danger for disease remas returng to more regular functions  operations requires gradual action completed  phases  based on data President Trump  the coronavirus Task Force recently recommended criteria for states  communities to achieve before movg to phases  reopeng this cludes a consistent downward trends  reported symptoms consistent downward trend  documented cases or positive tests as well as hospitals beg able to treat all patients without crisis care  robust testg  place for all at risk health care workers while this is a helpful reopeng group blueprt states are not strictly bound to it deed just as there are 50 separate  unique states there may be well 50 different approaches to reopeng they carry the same spirit  caution  decisionmakg based on sound data however the idea behd these three phases is to gradually allow busesses  workplaces to open back up but not immediately at full speed ahead or without adaptations to prevent crowded environments  the earliest phases this may clude limitg the number  employees side  workplaces contug telework practices vulnerable  other older Americans remag at home or limitg the number  customers side retail stores  restaurants clearly life is gog to be different gog forward for a while  it wasn't our immediate past regardless  the phase  reopeng  our communities we must remember not to abon practical  hygienic precautions like thoroughly frequently washg hs not touchg our faces daily disfectg  surfaces keepg a safe distance from others  stayg at home when you're sick fally it's critically important that the federal government learns from this crisis  actively prepares to face down another pemic  the future well I'm proud that Congress has generously vested  worthy tools  response resources to strengthen our readess  recent years it must be an even higher priority  the days to come though the United States was as prepared as any country to face the emergency you can never be fully prepared for what you don't know is comg  this case a mysterious  deadly virus origatg   only identified early this year  for which a vacce does not yet exist I look forward to hearg more recommendations from our witness madam chair this morng  I yield back the balance  my time let me say thank you to the rankg member  assure you that we will contue as a subcommittee to work together  a collaborative spirit to do what's right  this area   other areas that we have jurisdiction over on behalf  the American people  let me also welcome our colleague congresswoman Jamie Herrera Butler you've come a long way a state that has really been hard hit by the coronavirus so thank you so much for beg here really appreciate that   now I would like to troduce our witnesses our first witnesses witness is dr. Tom Frieden dr. Frieden is president  CEO  resolve to save lives a global itiative  part  the global public health organization vital strategies dr. Frieden was director  the Centers for Disease Control  Prevention the CDC from 2009 through 2016 dr. Frieden is recognized as one  the world's leadg experts his current organization is assistg more than 60 countries durg this covert 19 epidemic as well as providg technical assistance to New York State  other jurisdictions here at home durg his time at CDC many will recall that he led the response to the Ebola outbreak along with his colleagues at the State Department he also spearheaded many new health itiatives here  the US cludg itiatives to address the opioid epidemic  to reduce chronic disease dr. Frieden we are so pleased to have you here today your full written test statement will be entered to the record  you are now recognized for your openg remarks thank you very much  good morng chairwoman DeLauro rankg member Coll distguished members  the subcommittee I appreciate the opportunity to testify  the next few mutes as you say I'll provide a perspective based on three decades  fightg fectious diseases  the US  globally the bottom le is that kovat is a terrible tragedy families have experienced devastatg loss parents have lost their jobs  all  our lives have been disrupted our war agast kovat will be long  difficult  we must act strategically now  establish a new way  preventg future health disasters at an appropriate time we can assess what went well  what didn't I'm acutely aware that hdsight is 20/20 it's far too easy to secondguess decisions that others have made we're just at the begng  this pemic  must focus on the future there was only one enemy here a dangerous microbe it's us agast them humans agast the virus we'll get through this best if we work together learn from each other  support each other here are 10 pla truth is about kovat 19 first it's really bad  New York City where I live I've heard for the past two months the sounds  ambulances day  night  New York City it's on the order  the 19181919 pemic more than 20,000 people when you look at all  the excess deaths  the last two months killed  less than two months that is as bad as the worst phase  the pemic 100 years ago even now with deaths decreasg substantially there are twice as many deaths from kovat  New York City as there are on a usual day from all other causes combed  sadly lookg at the u.s. as a whole just calculatg forward from the number  people whose fections have already been documented there will be tragically at least 100,000 deaths from kovat by the end  this month second as bad as this has been it's just the begng until we have an effective vacce  unless somethg very unexpected happens our viral enemy will be with us for many months  possibly many years third data is a very powerful weapon agast this virus realtime monitorg  trends fdg cases before they become clusters clusters before they become outbreaks outbreaks before they become explosive epidemics that risk the lives  health care workers  others fourth we'll be able to reopen as soon  safely as possible by basg decisions on data  creatg together a new normal we're also impatient to restart our activities shelterg  place is a blunt but effective weapon it suppresses spread  the virus but flicts severe economic hardship on dividuals  the economy we need to deploy all  the effective weapons  our Arsenal after flatteng the curve the next step is what we call the box it  strategy there are four corners to each  the box   aspects testg widely  strategically isolatg people who test positive usg contact tracg to confidentially warn people who were exposed to the virus  quarante  contacts providg essential services so that they can be sure that fection stops with them if any corner  that box is weak the virus can escape  spread explosively aga each  the four is important fifth fd the balance between restartg our economy  lettg the virus run rampant we're conditioned to thk  terms  dichotomies a versus B but  this case open versus closed is not a dichotomy it's more accurate to thk  a dimmer switch or a dimmer dial than an on/f switch with gradations to avoid undue risk even when we're closed many essential activities contue  when we reopen our new normal will be different with care  creativity we can open sooner  safer our new normal will change the way we travel work learn  go about our lives the virus can create a new generation  mutes but  human populations it takes weeks to see the result  return repeated spread so if as we reopen there's a lot  spread it will take weeks before we actually see it another false dichotomy is between public health  economic security  fact the very best way to get our economy back is to control the virus  economic stability is critically important to the public's health sixth we must protect the health care workers  other essential staff who are the frontle heroes  this war they should never have to put their lives at risk to care for us havg safe for health care facilities is essential to enablg more societal activity to resume it's one thg to take risks for yourself but if the risk that you take for yourself ends up fectg a nurse or doctor  then their mother or father or child that's somethg quite different vii we have to protect our most vulnerable people unless we take urgent action there will be at least 100,000 deaths  nursg homes throughout this country all congregate facilities  highrisk highrisk settgs require tensive protection we must also act now to reduce the higher rates  both fection  death among africanamerican ive American  Hispanic people viii governments  private companies must jo forces to make massive contued vestments  testg  distributg a vacce as soon as possible ensurg rapid  equitable access  this country  around the world nothg else will enable life to get back to a pre kovat normalcy treatments can help  should be available sooner but are unlikely to be the kd  gamechanger that a safe  effective vacce would be nth we must heighten not neglect our focus on non kovat health issues this is a very important lesson from around the world not only do underlyg conditions crease the risk  severe illness from Kovan but if we don't contue noncovered conditions there will be many deaths that could have been avoided not from people fected with kovat but from people affected by the disruption  services that kovat causes  when fall comes around we'll need to do the best we've ever done at gettg people vaccated agast fluenza because that will make our job easier  the next phase tenth never aga it is evitable that there will be future outbreaks it's not evitable that we will contue to be so underprepared this is an terconnected world a disease risk anywhere is a disease risk everywhere  when the world is safer we will be safer it was very difficult as you all know to secure fundg for global health security it took years  effort  fundg was only allocated after the Ebola epidemic hit  that only onetime fundg therefore Congress  the admistration deserve congratulations for quickly passg comprehensive bipartisan legislation for supplemental fundg for the kovat response but supplemental fundg is a temporary fix it's a baid without sustaed support our health will be avoid ibly atrisk onetime funds are very problematic from the pot  view  somethg someone runng an agency you can't hire the best staff you can't enter to partnership with countries  organizations where you can keep up your end  the barga  you can't hold contractors accountable for an ongog contract you  Congress have a unique opportunity to take strategic action  protect Americans from another microbial sneak attack to protect us from health threats we have to change the way we allocate funds we've all been through this discretionary fundg is subject to caps  sequestration even matory fundg doesn't ensure stable support as we've seen we propose a new approach for specific public health programs these are programs particularly to prevent detect  respond to health threats  we suggest callg this to health defense operations or HD Oh was a budget designation it would exempt only these critical health protection funds from Budget Control Act caps so our public health agencies can protect us hgo programs should be required to submit a bypass pressional judgment directly to Congress annually just as the NIH does for HIV zheimer's  cancer that way Congress  the American people can underst what's really needed for our public health defense  Congress can appropriate the resources required to susta the public health system we need to keep us safe this vestment can save millions  lives  potentially as we've seen trillions  dollars good public health is good busess  my 30 years  global public health I've never seen anythg like this it's scary it's unprecedented we're learng more each day I've outled some  the thgs that we can do at home  busess  government right now to slow the spread  kovat  rebuild our economy we must make sure this never happens aga by vestg  systems to fd  stop emergg health threats before they spread whenever  wherever that's possible thank you  I look forward to answerg your questions thank you very much dr. Frieden  appreciative I I thk so personally about this this issue I never know him but my grfather died  the Spanish fluenza 1918 at age 36 leavg a widow  five children  one on the way  so it really brgs it all home that we could be now experiencg this  our families could be experiencg all  this now I'd like to troduce our second witness dr. Caitl rivers dr. rivers is a senior scholar at the Johns Hopks center for health security as well as assistant pressor  the department  environmental health  engeerg at the Johns Hopks  School  Public Health dr. rivers has been a leadg public health voice durg the response to covert 19 she coauthored a report along with dr. Scott Gottlieb  their colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute AEI a roadmap to reopeng which outles a series  milestones  capabilities that states should meet as they consider easg restrictions on busesses  social life dr. rivers is also the lead author  a report public health prciples for a phased reopeng durg kovat 19 guidance for governors which is beg used by the ional Governors Association as well as Maryl  Washgton DC to guide their reopeng plans I would also note that dr. Rivers worked as an epidemiologist for the United States Army Public Health Center as a department  defense smart scholar dr. rivers we are so pleased to have you with us here today aga your full written statement will be entered to the record you will now are recognized for your openg remarks Thank You Jerome  DeLauro rankg member Cole  distguished members  the committee thank you for the chance to speak with you today about the coab  neteen response as chairwoman DeLauro described I'm an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopks Center for Health security at the  Johns Hopks  School  Public Health I've coauthored a number  reports  guidance documents on reopeng safely  it's lessons from that work that I want to share with you today but first a little bit about the COPE the current situation the United States still faces 25 to 30,000 new cases every day  approximately 2,000 deaths a range that held steady for the entire month  April many states are either movg towards reopeng or lookg ahead to those decisions  wonderg as we all are how to do that safely it's clear to me that we are  a critical moment  this fight we risk complacency  acceptg the preventable deaths  2,000 Americans each day we risk complacency  acceptg that our health care workers do not have what they need to do their job safely  we risk complacency  recognizg that without contued vigilance we will aga create the conditions that led to us beg the worst affected country  the world  so with that  md I want to highlight a few critical capacities that I thk we should be prioritizg the first critical capacity is diagnostic testg last week we performed about 1.6 million tests which is a big improvement over March  even over early April when we performed about 1 million tests per week these gas are a testament to the impressive biomedical enterprise that we have built through sustaed vestment  science  medice but estimates  the number  tests that we will need to ga control  this outbreak start at 3.5 million per week  go up from there we urgently need a national plan for how we will close that gap we need to underst what national capacities we can expect at the end  may at the end  June at the end  August where the bottlenecks where are the untapped resources  it's not just for the test kits it's also for all  those consumable supplies that are required for testg the swabs the PPE for the care providers the viral transport media there are a lot  components volved  diagnostic testg  at various pots all  those have been located  termittent shortages  we urgently need to underst where we are gog with diagnostic testg  how we are gog to get there if this work has been done I have not seen it  I fear that neither have the governor's  the mayors  the busess leaders  the university presidents  the school prcipals all  whom are havg to make decisions about how  when to reopen so it's not just the federal government that needs this formation it's really all  us who are tryg to navigate how we will get from where we are to where we want to be the second capacity is contact tracg you heard from dr. Frieden that contact tracg is really a key component a key approach that will allow us to reopen safely one thg that I don't hear a lot about about contact tracg though that I want to brg to your attention is that it's also a key source  data that we badly need we currently have very little understg about where people are gettg fected our most new cases  longterm care facilities or correctional facilities which we know are highrisk settgs but we don't have a good sense  whether 99%  our cases origate  those special settgs or whether it's a small fraction we don't know whether people who are essential workers still performg duties  the community are gettg fected or we don't know whether most fections are happeng at home gettg a better understg  what that looks like will help us to guide better terventions if it is special settgs we know we need to be dog more to protect people there but we might also assess the risk to the general community to be lower on the other h if most people are gettg fected at home that pots for a need for some sort  central isolation capacity by which I mean if people feel that they would be safer recoverg  a hotel away from their families for example that should be an option that should be made available to them but we would want to know what fraction  cases are origatg  the household to underst whether that is an important vestment this formation on where transmission is occurrg is  critical importance but it's not currently beg prioritized  it is contact tracg that allows us to collect this data so  addition to beg a key tool for contament it's also a key tool for helpg us to guide our response  the decisions that we need for that the third pillar is health care capacity we were able to secure enough healthcare capacity to treat everyone with kovat only through extraordary measures like cancelg an elective procedures  turng operatg rooms to ICUs but right as we start to thk about unwdg some  those decisions is when states are movg to reopen  so we need to be exquisitely careful  this period that we do not allow our health care systems to become overwhelmed by drawg down our search capacity as we crease time spent  the community we need to be careful that we do not aga create the conditions  New York or Lombardi or Wuhan we should plan now for how we will staff  fund deployables EEMs to move from hot spot to hot spot  I'll pot out too that we are makg these decisions as we face hurricane season which will draw on many  the same resources  so I thk we need to be planned for the worst case scenario  underst that we we may be needg these surge capacity resources  the comg months  we should also contue to fight for sufficient supplies for personal protective equipment to keep our health care workers safe this has been a contuous problem  it's one we need to solve permanently it's not acceptable that our health care workers don't have what they need to do their job safely so these three capacities testg contact tracg  health care will enable us to transition safely from stayg at home to slow the spread to a gradual reopeng we should be workg now to ensure that we have the tools to do that successfully I now want to touch briefly on a longerterm priority that I thk we should keep  our sights we've seen on the White House Task Force briefgs  on the nightly news that fectious disease modelg or outbreak science is playg an important role  guidg the köppen 19 response  it's not just CO vid this was also an important capacity durg 201 Ebola durg h1n1  it will certaly be an important resource  the future pemics that we can be confident we will face but what many people don't realize is that the expertise to produce those models is not a stg national capacity it's mostly a volunteer force  academics who produce those models this approach sts  stark contrast to weather forecastg which the nation has vested  for decades through the ional Weather Service we don't have anythg like that for outbreaks but this pemic underscores why that must change we should consider establishg a national center that would perform epidemic forecastg  analytics  just briefly one other longerterm priority that I thk should be considerg or opportunity rather is that we put enormous resources to developg medical countermeasures for threats that we have previously identified but we don't have dedicated programs for what we call it disease X or these new pathogens that we didn't know existed until suddenly they are an enormous threat  so I thk we should be thkg about how we could st up programs  fund resources to develop the tools we need to exp our capacities  raise the bar  readess for those pathogens that we don't know anythg about but that we could be facg at any pot so  conclusion thanks to the leadership  the House Appropriations Committee the country has made important progress towards combatg this pemic we must prioritize the strengtheng  capacities  diagnostic testg contact tracg  the health system so we can successfully combat the virus  the weeks months  years to come thank you thank you so much dr. rivers at some pot I would love to talk to you about your idea on a a center ak to the national weather weather service it's a try to fd out more about it I'm gonna as  the past we will proceed to five mute rounds alternatg back  forth by seniority as members were seated at the begng  the taste hearg we're gog to be respectful  our witnesses  tryg to give them enough time to respond to two questions I will move forward dr. Frieden  dr. rivers both  you have provided recommendations about the type  state  local capacity that needs to be  place before scalg back limitations on economic or social activity accordg to reports disease modelers are projectg the country is movg  exactly the opposite direction accordg to a range  projections new daily cases  Kovach 19 could surge this month  some are projectg that deaths could rise to 3,000 each day  I would just like to ask a series  questions  each  you to the best  your knowledge is there a sgle state that has met the necessary parameters to ease restrictions we suggest  our a I report that she mentioned at the begng  the session that there are four criteria that states should meet  order to safely reopen  not all states have adopted these criteria but I'll review them just as a startg pot the first it's just to see the number  new cases decle for at least two weeks  some states have met that criteria but there are three other criteria  they we suggest they should all be met the other is enough public health capacity to conduct contact tracg on all new cases enough diagnostic testg to test everybody with kovat like symptoms not just those people with severe illness  enough healthcare system capacity to treat everyone safely to my knowledge there are no states that meet all four  those criteria dr. Frieden there any sgle state that meets the criteria laid out I have not looked at all  the data from all states but I would make two comments one there may be areas with states that are closer than others to meetg that  second as I said  my openg testimony open versus closed is not a strict on/f switch there are thgs that are always open essential services essential retail hospitals emergency facilities  there are thgs that might be first to open out  doors is way less risky than side lower risk busesses take out from restaurants outdoor recreation even daycare if done very carefully  safely may be lower risk so I thk we need to thk  this as a dimmer rather than an on/f switch just a quick followup here  then I want to get to items any state testg 1%  its population every week just know no any state  region been able to reduce the basic reproductive number below one meang that the epidemic is no longer growg there is some evidence that some states have dr. rivers you are the lead author  a report where you're makg recommendations to the governor's typically reopeng will crease the risk  Kovach 19 spread therefore it is important for leaders to know that gettg thgs open aga we'll crease the risks  dividuals contractg Kovach 19  there is no way to completely guard agast that let me ask this  both  you should the country be reopeng now are we ready is it irresponsible to open the economy without adequate testg I thk there is an enormous need to balance public health with the economic pressures  so I thk that's what we see factorg to decisions I thk as even as we move towards reopeng  as some states make that decision we still need to be focusg on creasg our capacities to do diagnostic testg  to do contact tracg the time the wdow we have to implement those terventions is still open  so I don't thk it's either/or I would say that we need to contue to rapidly ramp up our ability to do all  the four thgs I mentioned not just test but also isolate people who are fected contact trace  quarante by havg all  those thgs  place we can come out safer  sooner  we start our economy without a risk  explosive spread I know it was it was dr. Fauci who  the last several days who said how many deaths  how much sufferg are we willg to accept if you want to get back to some sense  normalcy what is your sense  what is acceptable  terms  deaths or sufferg to be able to get back to normalcy if we don't have the public health public health pressionals advisg us I thk we need to contue to prioritize Public Health we have seen that several other countries have regaed control  their outbreaks South Korea Sgapore Australia we can do that too it's gog to be difficult  it's gog to take a lot  vestment  our communities but option remas open to us I would just add we have to ensure that we protect our health care workers  other essential workers they are not makg a choice they are dog their duty  protectg  providg essential services  we have to do everythg possible to keep them safe  we have to pay particular attention to the most vulnerable such as our nursg homes large congregate facilities homeless shelters correctional facilities large factories where many people are workg together where we can see explosive spread that can not only cause a lot  sufferg death but also seed fections to elsewhere  the community it's the is that what the the criteria is how many deaths  sufferg are we willg to accept  your view I thk this is a balance we need to reopen so we can restart important medical care we need to reopen for our economy but we need to do that  a way that is careful  doesn't risk an explosion  cases that sends us back to our homes thank you yield now to my colleague congressman cotton thank you madam chair  I want to thank both  you for your excellent testimony  aga for the papers you submitted dr. Frieden let me start with you I'm very trigued by the idea you've presented about a special health defense budget sort  the equivalent  what  defense we'd call OCO spendg that is somethg outside the caps we just recognize we're war we spend what it takes to w the war regardless whatever budget mechanisms  I thk this is you know you  I have had this discussion the Chairman  I have had this discussion about particulars that need perhaps to be exempted could you go through it a little bit more to fail  talk to us about what specific accounts  your view we would need to sort  set outside the normal budget process  say when it comes to public health  threats that are merged we're gonna have to be free to spend what we need  these areas thank you very much  I appreciate all  your commitment to this issue over the years we've discussed it for many years  what we've seen is if it's  discretionary no matter how well tentioned everyone is there are gog to be problems if it's  matory no matter how fixed we thk it is it isn't so what we've suggested is somethg similar to the overseas contgency account that allows for a pressional judgment  what's needed  if we can enter to the record a letter sent to both Senate  House leaders yesterday  signed by a former Senate Majority Leader's that fished  Daschle as well as myself  multiple other former CDC directors bill faggy David Satcher Jeff madam chair I'd ask that we could  event letter if we made to the record  that it also cludes budget le examples  which would be cluded there squarely  the area  protectg Americans we wouldn't want to choose between our military radar defense  another part  the budget  the same way we shouldn't have to choose between this kd  defense  another part  our budget mr. Cole you've said over the years that Americans are far more likely to be killed by a pemic than by a terrorist attack  I'm afraid the past month has shown that to be quite prescient  the same way I thk we have to recognize that there other than nuclear war there's nothg else that can kill 10 million people around the world except a biological event  we have to do everythg  our power to prevent that from happeng so the approach is essentially twold one you identify the budget les you make them f budget through this HDO or some other mechanism similar to the Osio account  second tightly related to that you require a bypass pressional judgment do not stop at go do not get cut 200 by OMB give the actual pressional judgment from what's needed so that  Congress   public you can assess that  then put  all  the accountability metrics for what we expect to see for the monies that are beg spent this is not a piggy bank this is a specific vestment  buildg up our national defense now I'm sure I'd suggest that somethg we need to work on together  maybe submit together for the consideration  our colleagues because it will take you know obviously agreement between the House the Senate  the executive branch I thk it's a very good idea  dr. rivers let me turn to you if I may  aga I very much enjoyed readg your paper  your testimony you made two pots that were particularly strikg to me probably because I agreed with them which was one your concern about everybody well you know we just appropriated 25 billion dollars for additional testg I'm not sure exactly what we're dog with it you know whether we really have a program set up  runng for it same thg about your pot on contact tracg this is an enormous Lee you know tensive manpower type operation particularly somethg this this size so what are the sorts  thgs you would recommend that we do that you would say okay this would be an adequate testg program this would be an adequate contact tracg program we've heard from many experts over the last few weeks different plans for what testg capacity we should have  what we would do with that capacity I'm suggestg we actually start at the other side  figure out what are the components  where is the room to go up on all  those components that's the part that's not clear to me as an epidemiologist I could say sure if we could test everybody once a week that would get us this if it were every two weeks we would have these options but it's not clear to me which  those plans is actually feasible  so I thk it's really important that we go step by step  figure that out  I thk we need a national plan  order to do that effectively I don't thk C it should be left to do it dependently  terms  contact tracg  addition to usg that as an approach for contament I thk we should be prioritizg data collection CDC recently put out new guidance for how data collection durg contact tracg should rather how data could be collected durg contact tracg  it does corporate many  the data elements that I thk would be really useful so progress has been made just  the past week on that I thk next we should be sure that that data gets reported  analyzed I thk all  the state health department's should be reportg   I thk the CDC should as well thank you very much thank you madam chair thank you  now like to recognize congressman Kathere Clark thank you for beg here thank you very much madam chairwoman is good to see everyone here  thank you so much for beg with us we underst that the testg is part  what we need to collect the data that you so aptly described as the weapon that is gog to help us defeat this virus  get our economy workg up  I very much like your image  a dimmer switch where we can dial thgs up  down because we want parts  our economy or or places  our different states to be able to open if they can safely do it but I thk it comes back to your box diagram  it starts with testg  as you described dr. rivers we are under testg right now if our goal  I'd be terested if you both agree the goal is one percent  the United States population once a week so that would be roughly 3.8 million tests  we're now at 1.6 so do you agree that that 1% is is the bet the right benchmark we should be aimg for I thk that is  the right ballpark but I would make the pot that we don't want to test 1%  America evenly distributed right we wanted to be focused on people who are symptomatic healthcare workers essential essential workers  I would just add to that we issued an outle a briefg note  who we thk needs to be tested by priority level because you could test 1% but exactly as dr. River said if you test the wrong 1% you're not gog to be optimally controllg you have to look at those with symptoms most likely to spread most likely to die  congregate facilities healthcare workers with symptoms contacts who are symptoms symptomatic hospitalized patients even without symptoms because they can spread it widely all people  a nursg home if there is a case there because there can be explosive spread essential workers who are asymptomatic so I thk it's key to look at the numbers but our estimate is that you would need at least two or three times a current volume even if you only tested the highest priority people to do it but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot we can't do at the same time to ramp up our other thgs because it's not gog to be one thg gets us out  this accept a vacce that's right  so we have to do all these thgs but with the tests to get to where we need to be to be testg those essential workers part  my understg is the test that we are usg now is efficient  expensive  requires a lot more  the swabs  other equipment that we frankly are just havg shortages  so where are we with potcontact testg more stant testg  even if their accuracy is not as good as the current test we're usg is it worth it if it is more widely distributed  lets us test more  these essential workers  people at the greatest risk there are two broad ways  testg for the virus itself through lookg for the genetic particles like the PCR that's beg done  lookg for antibodies I'll leave antibody testg aside because there are many unknowns about it with the potcare testg for the virus there are some systems that are relatively rapid now but they're low throughput so you're only gog to be testg a few people each hour or people over a fourhour period so that rapid pot  care needs to be looked at there are newer technologies  older technologies that may be helpful but you're always gog to have to take a good sample  you're always gog to have to be lookg for a ty amount  Jenner genetic material so your idea  a test that would have what we would call a low sensitivity but still a high specificity  other words some false negatives but it could rule someone  would be very helpful but does not yet exist on the market what what are some  the limitg factors for reachg just the sheer number  tests that we're gog to need  how can we address them as we look at puttg together a budget that can really use this develop the data we need I tried  earnest to fd this out  I wasn't able to determe what the gaps are  I thk  itself is a big problem I thk contug to brg new platforms onto the market will be helpful but then what about swaps  what about the PPE that the health care workers need to take the samples it's opaque to me  I thk that's somethg we could fix I have just a few mutes left I would just say that it at this pot I can't underscore  agree with you more on the need for a national plan  that states are too terconnected  we need to be learng from each other  how this virus is beg spread  how we can best do these thgs test isolate trace  quarante  safely brg our economy open that's the goal  everybody here but we need to support that  a national way thank you madam chair thank you very much  sce I come from one  the stay at home states  represent a fairly rural district you know a lot  what I'm gog to talk about is why we should treat everythg uniform I mean rural areas are can be treated differently because the disease burden is less the stra on the hospital system etc etc so first  all well doctor free new said I thk I quote here shelter  place is blunt but effective we don't really have scientific data on that for coronavirus do we because if you plot actually the what the states have done versus their or the severity  the measures states have gone versus their case counts you actually fd the states with less restrictions  place sometimes have lower case counts examples Florida so we really have no date a specific objective data about that do we prospectively looked at for their coronavirus for kovat 19 for kovat 19 if we look at formation from around the world it's very clear that when people stay home it reduces the spread but it's also clear doctor that there are countries cludg Sgapore  South Korea that been able to limit the amount  physical restrictions or physical distancg  still control the virus  there are differences  different environments so Florida for stance didn't put  stay at home but their case rate is lower than Maryl's for stance right there are many factors that go to what the case rate is that's right so so so my pot is that that shelterplace might work but it might be just the fitness the social distancg the shelter  place obviously implies now dr. rivers I looked at the recommendations from AEI there a month old is that right yes so we've learned a lot  the last month haven't we about this disease so for stance as we ramp up testg the first criteria is that your case count has to go down well as you ramp up testg you're gonna fd cases that you wouldn't have found so for stance I'm sure you're aware there's a Michigan prison where they tested all their prisoners 60% tested positive they were asymptomatic  an Ohio prison 73% tested positive the vast majority asymptomatic so they're clearly asymptomatic cases around  as you ramp up testg so what you're gog to do is you can be chasg your tail  now sce the entire purpose  restrictions was to mimize stress on the healthcare system right because we want our healthcare system take care  people so that they don't die then why wouldn't hospitalizations or ICU occupancy even more importantly be the benchmark because  Maryl we've plateaued  ICU utilizations but our case counts contue to go up as we beg to go to a hot spot for stance the processg facilities poultry processg facilities well you go  there there are a lot  healthy people they may have corona virus but they're otherwise healthy they're asymptomatic you're gonna start testg them you're gonna fd a whole lot  cases but that doesn't mean that your community's health care system is overstraed so why would you choose cases  not hospitalizations or ICU utilization as your benchmark I would add to your statement that the purpose  lockdowns or stayathome orders it's true was to prevent overwhelmg our healthcare system but it was also to give us time to build up our capacities to do case based management  I thk we shouldn't lose sight  that so let me talk a little about case based management a lot has been said about contact tracg doctor rivers what is the procedure for every case that we have diagnosed what's your estimate  the number  cases that exist that are asymptomatic people were asymptomatic they never had symptoms so they would never be detected for contact tracg emergg evidence is that about 25 to 50 percent  cases are asymptomatic but those people would still be affected by quarante now you do know the the the  Stockholm the estimate is that for every case that's identified there are 73 cases that haven't been identified is that right do you know that you're aware  that statistic they have not shared their scientific data so although we have the technology it's reported you can google it it's reported so 70 so so if we concentrate on contact tracg  that's the you know that's our gold stard is we have to have contact tracg for every patient we contact trace we could have 10 20 people who are out there asymptomatic not contact tracg  the description  contact tracg as well you know we're gonna educate the people who are fected  the people they could have come come  contact with about what the good you know public health measures are wouldn't it be more effective we've just educated everybody because we really don't know who's an asymptomatic carrier that is educate everyone you know wear a mask when you go out  public so you don't spread the disease make sure you wash your hs make sure you don't touch you touch your face your nose you met you know these are the thgs as doctors we have known for years look we know how to how to prevent the spread  respiratory viruses what we're dog so now educatg the broader population but to say that we're gonna do this through contact testg  not very broad education I thk means we're gog to we're gog to we're gonna set a stard you know to tra a hundred thous people nationwide tense through contact tracg could take weeks I have small busess owners  my state who  my district tell me they can't last weeks they're gonna go out  busess so uh you tell me dr. rivers why a busess owner  my district who sees five customers  a store for an entire day can't safely operate with social distancg masks  h hygiene I don't thk the economy will be able to recover robustly if people are afraid  gettg fected  the community  so I thk it's to the advantage  the economy if we can implement it  rega control usg cases you thk it's dangerous for that store owner to open up their store usg CDC guideles  we won't even get to because I was gonna ask him maybe  a second round I will why the who guideles to the  Health Organization guideles are so much different from the CDC guideles so you thk it's dangerous for that store owner to open that I thk customers won't want to visit if they don't have come that's their choice isn't it only customers thank you I yield back thank you madam chair  dr. rivers  dr. Frieden thank you very much for takg the time to be here with us today I want to ask you about Cova 19  rural communities it's the district that I represent  the northwest corner  the state  Illois 85%  the towns are five thous people are fewer sixty percent  the towns or a thous people are fewer so that gives you a picture  the kd  district that I represent there are people who thk that Cova 19 is less serious  rural areas   outside  you know not highly populated not high density  population  so a couple examples that I want to share with you  what we're seeg  this congressional district we have a hundred  two counties  the state  Illois two  those counties one is called Warren County which is  the congressional district I serve has a population about 17,000 people so so not not a large population it now has the fifth highest number  cases per capita  the state  Illois another County is Stevenson County it's on the Wiscons state le has a population  about ,000 people the number  cases Cova 19 cases there are doublg every five days all right so that is the third fastest rate  the state  Illois so just want to give you a little purse back so you know I know like if you look nationally we have many many governors now who are pushg for our country to reopen  I'm certaly  their own States lookg at reopeng  there are also these ideas that you can we can reopen  a state  tears you know where it's less populated  versus where it's more populated so wonderg if you can address that along the les  what resources  practices do we need to know  more  these rural areas what do we need a certa level  testg maybe if you can just drill down  how it's different  rural America versus you know towns like cities like Chicago or New York  this is addressed to both  you I'd like to hear from both  you on this if I could please well first I would say that  general the challenges  urban areas may be more severe what to do about crowded subway systems bus systems very close quarters  the US  globally is somethg that we have not yet figured out  is an enormous challenge but no area is immune we don't have immunity to this virus   each community there may be nursg homes there may be factories there may be other facilities where there is potential for a lot  spread  there may be less access for the kd  tensive care that is needed  some rural areas  the country I thk somethg doctor ever said is is really important to highlight  that is the importance  data we are learng more about this virus every day the famous Nobel laureate Josh Lederberg used to say the microbes outnumber us it's their numbers agast our bras  we have to use telligence to figure out what the weaknesses  the virus are to underst for example where it's spreadg what are the highest risk thgs I talked about two dichotomies  my testimony open versus closed it's really a question  degree different thgs second was public health versus the economy  fact together we can resolve another forced academy is safe  risky it's really safer  riskier so we need to make as much  our environment by design by changg the way we go about our busess as safe as possible reduce risk  we'll do that by understg more through thgs like contact tracg where the disease is spreadg  how to reduce it spread most effectively thank you I would just add that rural areas have seen less explosive growth which is encouragg but they also tend to have less capacities  so I worry that a community may have a manageable level  transmission until a congregate settg like a correctional facility or a nursg home becomes fected  then suddenly the local hospital might have 25 high acuity patients that need to be admitted  the hospital might not be able to accommodate that  so I thk that's the kd  search capacity that we need to be planng for is supportg rural communities when they do have a change  their epidemiology I've got 3 seconds left Rosa can may I ask a second question that follows up on this so I'm speakg  correctional facilities we have two federal prisons  the congressional district I serve  I don't know if you've been followg this case very or this this topic very closely but the the Marshal Service has turned over mates to the Bureau  Prisons to go to 11 different prisons throughout the the country for transfer  patients that are not tested for Kovan 19 one  those prisons is  Thompson Illois this is  a county called Carroll County zero hospitals they're you'd have to travel over across the Mississippi River to Iowa to go to the hospital or a County to the north or County to the south so wonderg about screeng the proper screeng that should happen before the transfer  any patients or I'm sorry any mates to another prison if you can talk about what would best practices look like for transferrg prisoners from one facility to another well the best prayer would be to mimize transfers first  foremost because anytime you're mixg more people you're creatg the possibility  explosive spread you would certaly want to ensure that no one who's symptomatic is transferred the challenge is that we recognize that there are a lot  asymptomatic people some  them presymptomatic they'll develop symptoms  the next couple  days  some  them will rema asymptomatic  they do appear to be able to spread the fection that's why even symptom screeng will be a problem   every congregate facility we need a comprehensive approach to reducg the risk that the virus will get  creasg the likelihood we'll fd it quickly if it does  improvg our ability to stop it from spreadg widely if it's spreadg  I which is that if there was an opportunity to use diagnostic testg one misstep or miscalculation that people sometimes make is to thk that just because you have a negative diagnostic test means you're not fected the situation you would want to avoid is when you test someone early  the cubation period  so they're already fected but there's not enough virus yet for the test to pick up  so it builds over the comg days  you thk you're gonna clear  you're not so couplg or timg the testg with a quarante period would be recommended all right thanks to you about that I yield back thank you madam chair so one thg  this is probably for both both y'all one thg we've learned from this pemic is that the importance  domestic production  essential medice  medical supplies  I could add to it many other thgs but obviously this is what's beg highlighted especially  over reliance on  however knowg how many tests we need what we've just talked about  how many vacces 300 million plus etc I worry there's no way to completely produce all  that with the United States at present possibly even with our adjacent allies this presents a serious threat to our security  our public health I know that's somethg we're gog to look at prospectively but we're still  the middle  this how would you rate our current domestic production capability  what steps do we need to be takg right now today to improve them I thk this pemic has emphasized the terconnectedness  the world cludg both the ability  viruses  other fectious agents to spread  the fragility  some  the supply chas from a variety  products cludg the active pharmaceutical gredients  many  our medications when it comes to PPE personal protective equipment there are means to crease production  safely reusable PPE such as elastomeric half face piece  95 respirators this was as an important technology that is not new it's been around for a while it's been used creasgly but it allows a healthcare worker to have an n95 that can be safely disfected between uses  used for months at a time so there are some technological improvements that can improve our supply cha  terms  vacces  therapeutics we don't yet have any so we don't know how difficult they will be to manufacture when they do exist I believe there will be a global commitment to ensurg that there is essentially opensource so that once we know how to make it anyone can make it   fact immediately even companies that had strongly opposed this for many years have agreed so I thk there's a recognition it's a global good but the manufacturg capacity is somethg that I plan I apologize I have a couple more questions I appreciate that very much did you want to add to that should I keep gog okay is was mentioned I flew very far to get here  I want to try  get through as many  these I can because this is so important  I appreciate your time what we have seen thus far it appears it appears that underlyg health conditions diabetes  others impact the likelihood that a kovat 19 patient will require hospitalization additionally shutdown orders  concerns about exposure have left many impacted with chronic I thk  endstage renal disease  others delayg medical care pursug alternative care sites such as home I thk about people who are waitg for transplants perhaps a kidney transplant  they're gettg told you know they have a donor a livg donor  they're beg told that's elective I don't know if you've ever been on life support waitg for kidney which is essentially what dialysis is doesn't feel very elective can you speak to the impact  the virus on those chronic disease communities  what you anticipate gog forward  maybe they're not the immediately immediately hospitalized ones right well they're not  this immediate attention sphere but they're certaly impacted kid either  you speak to that just to acknowledge the importance  this question there are so many secondary impacts  this pemic  those with underlyg health conditions as you say not only are more likely to get severe disease when fected with Cova but are also strugglg with managg their conditions  so I thk this does need to be a priority both for this response  also as we do preparedness planng gog forward thank you as folks here know Lucille roybalallard  I chair the House maternity care caucus  while medical providers are takg all necessary precautions to protect mothers patients frontle workers as women are still givg birth surprise surprise certa thgs don't just stop because we all said it should we're where we are seeg mothers ten forced to labor without partners or family members or midwives  fact I have a case  a mother who was potentially gog to lose her baby  she could not I mean they knew it was a preexistg condition  the father couldn't come with her she had her own merit called the baby lived but these are the types  thgs mothers are facg right now are as we work to better prepare our countries  our communities for future pemics what recommendations would you give to providers  the maternal health community to better protect new  expectant mothers this is an area  someone outside  my expertise but I thk access to personal protective equipment should be one  the primary resources our strategic national stockpile was not able to support all  the PPE needs for this pemic  I thk that's a lesson that we can take gog forward that would benefit the maternity community  also health care workers broadly thank you go back if I might just tell my colleague that what we did do  terms  the manufacturg effort through billion I'm not enough to barter to support advanced research  development  vacces therapeutics diagnostics prioritizg platform based technology with usbased manufacturg capabilities   the cares Act there was at least 3.5 billion for Barda for the same effort so that the conversations are tryg to move  the direction  havg more dependence  that area congressman not bonnie watson call me Thank You chairwoman I want to thank both  you for your comg here today  your testimony  also the work you've been dog  this  this area I know that we're gonna be safest when there's a vacce I know we're gonna have dust ups when there is a vacce as to whether or not everyone will take it my understg  the development  a vacce     it's testg takes a while  that it's it could be years is there any substitution  the efficacy  a  that  Ivette developg the best vacce that will countermeasure years dr. Frieden dr. rivers there's nothg more important  the fight agast this virus  developg a vacce this the quickest vacce development so far historically has been about four years dr. Tony Fauci has suggested that 12 to 18 months is possible  all  us would like to see a vacce as soon as possible there are many many vacce cidates beg considered  different models  assessg vacce vacce efficacy beg developed already some  them are  phase one trials fundamentally we need on the one h to do everythg possible to get a vacce as soon as possible on the other h we need to recognize that vacce development is uncerta  it may be a long time  it may not be as effective as we would like so we need to do everythg possible to make a vacce but we can't assume that we'll have one  we need to act accordgly with all  the other measures that we can dr. earth I would just add that identifyg a safe  effective vacce is just the first step  that we also need to thk about manufacturg production  distribution because those are steps that can take a long time to but if we thk  plan now we can also I thk speed up the timele on that at 30 mutes under what circumstances are asymptomatic people beg tested now  this country there are various different situations most important is when there is an outbreak  a congregate facility so if there's a case  a nursg home we would thk everyone  that nursg home needs to be tested what about outside  a facility we're seeg some testg done to release people from isolation that may not be necessary or effective you don't really know what a fatly positive test means  that circumstance but contacts  cases could ideally be tested to see if they're fected because if they're fected then contact tracg needs to be done  them also but dr. rivers may have more to say on this I agree with testg people without symptoms it's not currently one  the higher priorities on the CDC priority list  so there's not a lot so that is a concern to someone like me I am over 65 years old I've got some  those conditions that have been raised as potential issues I can't just stay home so I need people to be tested  general so that I know that I'm  a more safe environment  a less safe environment how long do you thk it would take us to get there  isn't it reasonable if not feasible isn't it necessary to get there universal testg is a strategy that it's not clear to me we will ever have the capacity to carry out that  I mean it's not clear to me it could be that we do but I'm not sure but an alternate approach is contact tracg that would allow us to rega control if done if those the level  scale necessary so you've outled a series  conditions that are more optimum for us to be able to open up  come out  do thgs where are we exactly right now this week right now where are we on that sort  spectrum enough testg   contact tracg enough isolatg enough alternative facilities for quarante where are we right now okay either one  booth can answer I can start us f right now most states  most communities are still stayg home to slow the spread as we start to move to Phase two which would be a gradual reopeng many some communities do you have sufficient diagnostic testg many communities do not States thanks to the preparations  this committee have fundg now to hire more contact tracers but I thk that that capacity is still  progress so we like  phase one  a half we are lookg ahead to Phase two I would say the way we thk  it is there three thgs you want to look at one is what's happeng with the virus our our severe fection is comg down  our estimated number  cases comg down controllg for the amount  testg to our our healthcare system is robust so our health care workers aren't gettg fected on the job  so that we have the capacity to treat a surge to manage ongog conditions like pregnancy safely  three is our public health system ready to box it  with contact tracg isolation I would say that there are some communities  some parts  the US that are gettg ready to do that but all  us need to have vigilance it's not about relaxg it's about creasg vigilance so that we can prevent explosive spread  save lives  restore our economy I just don't know how close we are to that I see I'm confused as to where we are  when we do allow states  they'll the governor's allow them to open ner cities I'd like to know what kd  dicators are public health pressionals willg to say or should say that you need to shut it back down or that it's okay to contue  that direction  I just AM NOT oh I'm not knowledgeable about that then  I don't get the impression that  general we are we've looked at that specifically when to loosen  when to tighten aga  the thgs that we would look at are thgs like consistent creasg case counts creases  what's called syndromic surveillance which is an early dication health care systems that are begng to get overwhelmed  a public health system that can't do to box it  well so we don't know where the cases are comg from  there are unlk cases  the community that's the optimal way but I thk we recognize that part  the stay at home may be able to be changed without undue risk for example outdoor activities  other thgs with physical distancg  when we go out it's not gog to be back to normal it's gog to be to a new normal with h sanitizer  perhaps face masks where it's spreadg widely  no touch doors  no touch elevator buttons  lots  ways to engeer risk out  our lives thank you I yield back I forgot I had my mask on I can just breathe for a second thank you very much I yield back I just to follow up for a second for a question but the American people deserves the truth the American people it's on the one h it's here  on the one h it's that we're  we are lookg to you to underst you know we hear on on TV  this is the ordary person we have access to probably other kds  formation but it's vacce how many how many are beg reviewed what are various different les  reviewed are the ma ones are there 0  up that 0 there are only two that are real is there a national testg plan I believe you said no we do not have a national testg plan we do not have a national contact tracg plan we do not have PPE no comm  control  what that is  where it is gog  the American people are scared they are scared they don't know what to believe  they may not go to that busess that dr. Harris talked about  they're not look at the pollg data they're not gog so what do we get to  we need are the CDC guideles on the testg beg followed honey yes or no I mean because I wanted to be mdful  my colleagues time as well are those CDC guideles beg followed about who gets tested  who doesn't or is it just a jump ball I mean that's the way it appears to me that we do not have a kd  a central control  what is happeng as you have poted out  the worst pemic gog back to 2002 to 1918 so how are the American people gog to get the answers that they need how are we you need to tell us what public policy itiatives need to be put  place you have a subcommittee here it is bipartisan it is critically important  so many  these pieces are with our jurisdiction that we need to underst we're not foolish enough to know that there's not absolute clarity but he'll give us more clarity than we have now  order to be able to provide the wherewithal so those who are  charge to carry out their mission on testg quick question should the CDC be  charge  that  that effort for the states be  charge  that effort  aga I need quick answers because I'm gonna run out  time federal government needs to establish the guideles provide the resources the implementation is done at the state  local level okay our state  local level does not have the resources today that it needs to do its job yes there are not enough tests currently well but a normal set  circumstances the public health frastructure  this country is weak  it's beg overrun not that it hasn't wanted to do the job it's beg over run so as your pot earlier we need to do somethg about that look we you know is there a plan if we have a vacce how does it get manufactured how does it get prioritized are there people sittg down as far as you know now  I'm lookg to the scientists I'm lookg to you because we know it havoc politics can play  I put that aside your the guideposts give us the plan  let us know absolutely  when the American public can say it's not gog to happen for 18 months you're not dumb we need truth  facts at this time I was not prepared to just go  this direction but we cannot say on the one h this  on the one h that if we are gog to get out  this  give us the posts to get us out  this the pillars that help us to ga that control so that we can move forward as a country went over my time apologize Tom the Chairman you never go over your time madam chair  I respect that  respect the concerns that you went through let me get because I thk the chair is right we're lookg for specifics so let me ask a very specific question to both  you I thk one  the you know early lessons from this is we certaly didn't have the the public lab testg capabilities let's say that we needed to respond as quickly as all  us would have liked to respond so just ask you  your pressional opion is that true  number two how would you go about remedyg that so that would be pot one number two   I could be wrong about this  would be happy to be corrected I also thought we were a little slow gettg our private sector partners to the fight for whatever reason I don't know if there's a barrier there I don't know if it you know we have to assure the market I realize these are forprit companies they have to make money but I don't thk we mobilize them nearly as rapidly as we probably should have  retrospect so the two questions would be what do we need to do to get our public health labs up to where they need to be what mechanisms that we need to be  place so that if we fd ourselves  an allout war with a microbe we have everybody on the field as quickly as we can get them there just to tie together your two questions we've spent a lot  money  time on Hospital preparedness  makg sure that our private medical facilities are able to respond to a mass casualty event we don't have somethg like that for Diagnostics  I thk we should because it's not just public health labs although we should be workg to crease their capacities it's also the private sector as you mentioned  so I thk we should have some sort  unifyg preparedness program for how we will make sure we are not caught  this position aga when it comes to Diagnostics I mean it's certaly the truth that the public health laboratories at national state  local levels are antiquated they're not usg the latest technologies they're still usg fax maches it's the testg methodologies it's formation technology  so that's somethg that needs to be upgraded it's also the case that we need to look at new platforms  newer diagnostic technologies there are novations comg  they're not cheap they will be expensive but you want to keep your fire department there  case there's a fire  the same way you want to keep your lab ready unfortunately the lab is ten the poor relation  the healthcare frastructure  for this kd  a response it's really a three legged stool you have the public health system dog Public Health laboratory testg you have Hospital laboratories developg their own tests  you have the private sector comg  with large volumes   this case all three  them had problems you know we actually dealt a little bit  that one  our last heargs before we were overtakg the CDC was actually talkg about developg a plan  terms  the technological updates they needed brg it to us I would hope you know they've obviously been dealg with a lot but I hope that has not to slip through the cracks because we're gonna need somethg like that I thk gog forward  that's a very specific vestment that we can make let me ask you a very different question if I may we've talked a lot about vulnerable groups  we know we certaly have vulnerable we have health disparities  the country we have mority groups we have lowercome groups we have a lot  people that fd themselves with higher degree  vulnerability much worse outcomes than the population  general  I want to talk about that maybe it had played around but I also want to asked about children I've had an terestg occasion I was mentiong to dr. Harris where I was talkg to ambassador from a friendly European country durg all this I said what are you dog  so one  the thgs we're dog  terms  gettg back is we're actually openg our school a lot faster than you guys are because our children are not particularly vulnerable  a lot  their parents are  their 30s  0s they're the workers that we actually need to get the economy gog up aga  they're not as vulnerable obviously as others so you have any thoughts  terms  number one what is happeng with younger people  this number two  not askg for master blueprt  what we should do but what would I do have concerns about the school system  gettg kids back up  operational  parents more able to get to the workplace thankfully we are able to observe that children are a lower risk  severe illness that's somethg we've seen  other countries it's somethg we're seeg  the United States  so that's encouragg what we don't know is what role  children play  transmission we know from pemic fluenza or rather fluenza generally that children are really central to transmission  the community not just  schools but the community broadly we haven't been able to p down the science yet  what exactly the role is  children  transmission  so that's where you see a lot  the uncertaty these two factors weigh agast each other  they get very difficult to come to a decision so I suggest that as other countries move toward reopeng which is happeng some countries are gog back to school  the comg weeks they will be collectg data  dog the analyses that will let us underst what the role  children is  I thk that will be helpful for formg our decision I would agree with all  that I would just say it we don't know why children  women are less likely to get severe illness with kov 19 it's a clue for somethg about the virus but as we reopen we want to prioritize societal benefit for example daycares if we keep out from daycare kids who have underlyg condition  staff who are older who have underlyg conditions at risk that may be a way  startg to reopen but we also have to consider if those kids get fection the staff get fection  come home  they're livg with their grparents are they at risk there  we don't know but I do thk that there's a valid argument to be made for a sooner reopeng  areas with younger people because  the lower risk but you have to do it  a way that mimizes risk  recognizes the vulnerable population that need to be protected as well as the risk  onward transmission thank you very much thank you madam chair thank you madam chair  thank you aga for all  this I wanted to just start with a broad question if you could name a country that you thk is dog a good job  if they have a national plan Sgapore has done a very good job  they do have a national plane any others oh come to md there are many countries that are that are do any  them not have a national plan do do any countries who successfully have done this have said we're gonna do this regionally or by city I thk there's a varyg degree  centralization  decentralization  different countries so even Germany which has a very effective response has a very decentralized form  government so there is a strong national guidance but regional implementation  that guidance  as far as I underst yeah but they certaly have a more unified health care system for delivery yes as we look at testg essential workers I thk it's easier to thk about health care workers but how do we how do you start to look at one area that I'm very terested  to follow up on the rankg members question is child care child care is critical to reopeng our economy we are not gog to have success if we don't have child care system which has been so underfunded  teeterg at the brk would you see sort  employer based testg is that how we would you know with a child care center it may be smaller would you test every teacher with those essential would you be lookg at auto manufacturg plants would you test every one comg on to the floor or would you do somethg more like what dr. Gottlieb suggested testg everybody who shows up at a doctor's fice whether that's a for a spraed ankle or for symptoms  coronavirus I'll make a brief comment  I completely agree that daycares childcare is particularly important  we've highlighted that  the tears from resolved to save lives from day one that this may be an area that can open sooner as long as we do it safer which means if there's a kid with an underlyg condition they shouldn't go  if there's a staff with an underlyg condition they shouldn't go  we should use h sanitizer frequently I thk the the the potential  mass testg is just that it's a potential  order to do that kd  testg you're talkg about tens  millions  tests a day  as exactly as dr. Versailles we don't know whether that will be feasible but I don't thk it's realistic to wait to reopen some  the most critical aspects  society until there is that kd  capacity I agree with comg back to not havg clarity about what kd  capacity we can expect but I also um I thk we need to underst more about the logistics  how that would work if you had a potcare test that could be right here that can only test five people an hour how would that work if you have an entire daycare center that needs to be tested I thk there are probably ways around that but it hasn't been worked out  so my pot is I don't thk that we should rely on havg that capacity I thk we will have to be prepared to move forward without it so how would you see gettg these you know gettg the testg done for the one percent that I underst will will vary  region  the country will vary how do you see that gog forward do you see somethg like dr. Gottlieb suggested where it would be people who come  to doctors fices so that you're gettg a rom sample startg with people who have symptoms  the nice thg about contact tracg is once you get  that network  once you are connected to people who are fected  the people who might get fected because they have been exposed you can contue to follow the network outward  so you don't have to be as concerned about checkg here there  everywhere because you really start to get a hle on transmission  the community so this sort  brgs us back to where we started that to even open somethg essential like child care that we're gog to need to open quickly  support as we're lookg at tremendous you know stability  a critical underpng  our economy we can't beg to do that until we have robust testg  try Sgh  Quarante II the sooner we established the boxes  strategy  test isolate contact trace from quarante the sooner  safer we can reach thank you thank you so um let me just ask them about the box it  strategy so dr. Frieden how many people do you thk there are asymptomatic for everyone that we have a diagnosed that because you know we talk about the number  cases but we should be very specific we mean the number  cases confirmed by testg   course what is your impression how many cases are there that aren't confirmed by testg the asymptomatic well there's two different questions there one is how many people were symptomatic  not tested  then how many people are asymptomatic  not tested so the number  fections we've documented is a small fraction  the total  what fraction do you thk that is it depends on the area  the country  the level  the test so it could be kd  high right so so how do you box  somethg when you're not recommendg testg asymptomatic people but you know they're asymptomatic people out there  aga it comes to the to to my question why wouldn't we just have very tensive education processes so that every American follows social distancg wearg a mask  you know h hygiene they so we kd  hammer this  because these are the prciples  get a test if you're symptomatic so I thk that's correct I thk we can do both  we have to do both because this is a very fectious virus  it's very deadly flutterg but the but the criteria for reopeng clude the need  I've seen this where it's been suggested don't reopen until you have contact testg  place what we can say is you will be safer if you're able to open with contact we're safer if we're not born we're safer from death if we're not born right I mean the bottom le is there's some element  risk  I brg this back to the compet you know stay at home might work  New York because if you leave your home  New York you're gonna get on a tra you're gonna get on a subway you're gonna get  a crowded street but if you're  my  parts  my district you're gonna leave home get  your car or truck drive to a store that has almost no customers  it conduct your busess  go back home because that's normally the way you live so why would you sist that or why is there sistence that stay at home is a the broad blanket statement it's effective because I will I'm not sure it adds anythg more  the stance I just gave you  a rural area so why do we have a kd  onesizefitsall approach when we can be much more nuanced about it I thk the concept  physical distancg is an important one   the scenario you outle if the dividual goes to the store  for example calls  advance picks up the order at the front that's a very lowrisk teraction if you go out   work outdoors that's a very lowrisk teraction right so so I would suggest you know I've visited  you know a couple  the stayathome thgs that just didn't don't make sense to me recreational boatg is prohibited  my state so a family that stays at home eats at home they don't wear masks at home they can't go out get on their boat  go out  the outdoors golf courses this you know outdoor there these there are guideles  place that would absolutely physically separate you from other people these thgs that aga nuanced approaches that you know stay at home is also you know one size fits all everybody got to stay at home no matter what it is you're gog outside to do can't we get more nuanced given the data we have  knowg how social distancg wearg a mask h hygiene we will likely be the major way to stop spread  this  some circumstances I thk that's generally correct one other factor to consider is environmental contamation kovat is spreadg like a super stars  we know that SARS through elevator buttons door hles  other ways so we have to thk also about reengeerg some  our environments so we have no touch doors  we reduce the number  contamated surfaces  clean them more reliably this is about adjustg to a new normal  the sooner we do that the sooner we can get our economies back without unduly stressg our health  health care systems sure just two or two additional thgs one kd  novel ideas that are comg forward one is the ability to test because nasal swabs are a problem but my understg their tests now that beg licensed that work on sputum so just salivary tests after that  what do you thk the effect  that will be on unavailable testg the other one are the the new antivirals that are beg spoken about obviously REM Desa vir you know made by Gilead which took money from the money they made from hepatitis C drugs  you know revested  helpg us cure this as well as the monoclonal antibody discovery  Israel reported I thk two or three days ago with these change the playg field I thk we have to see that we're learng more about this every sgle day  the more we learn the more we can do  a sputum testg is it is it likely that it will work that you can actually test if you're sensitive you know sce it enough assay for virus  so you don't need a nasal swab I would need to see the data on it okay thank you yield back thank you madam chair wonderg if you can share with us the the patient experience the the patient who has cope  neteen goes to the hospital what's the how long is it takg there what's the treatment  then what's the hospital bill look like if you could maybe talk through that one thg is that for many patients it doesn't require a hospitalization   areas  the country like New York City where there are overwhelmg numbers  patients what has been said for the past couple  months is if you're just mildly ill stay home because you're gog to come   you're gonna use up scarce resources if you don't have it you might get  fact that if you do have it you might affect someone else  if you have it you'll just be told go home that may not be the right answer there might answer may be if you can't be safely cared for at home because you may  fact your grmother or someone who's got cancer come to this facility  will care for you until you're no longer fectious  that's somethg that we need to thk gog forward but for someone who comes to the hospital what we're seeg is very low levels  oxygen  the blood  that's a big concern so oxygenation is a major component  care is probably the most important part  supportive care  someone with kovat  doctors  tensive care units are figurg out ways to support oxygenation without tubation  use  ventilators that's a new fdg  tensive care  reduces the number  sulators we thought would be needed the what is that care if you don't need the there are a variety  ways to position patients or give oxygen through other means that don't require sertion  a bleep breathg tube  may be effective  then general supportive care for the dividual makg sure that they're well cared for we've seen very severely ill patients  cities that have been hard hit havg a very low survival rate partly because they're so severely ill partly because systems are somewhat overwhelmed we're learng more about how to care for patients all the time there is potentially good news with REM death severe the antiviral it appeared to shorten the time to recovery  a welldone study that hasn't yet been released but the data has been shared it had a little bit about that reduce it by from 15 days to 11 days okay  it reduced mortality rate by about 30% although that difference wasn't statistically significant significant given the size  the sample so a trend a non significant trend toward a lower death rate okay I'm guessg if you are hospitalized this is gog to result  probably thouss  dollars  hospital bills tensive care is extremely expense  do we have any hard numbers associated with what an average stay is gog to look like for four patients I'm sorry okay all right  part  this I want to make an editorial comment  that congressman lloyd doggett congresswoman Susan wild  I have a bill that would call for the openg up  the reenrollment for the Affordable Care Act right now when we have 30 million unsured Americans   the state  Illois we have enough we have 800,000 unsured Americans so I actually partially wanted you to go through that I mean we know this is gog to be very costly I mean we know it by the you know the economic recovery bills that we're lookg at but I just thk it's critically important the Trump admistration has pushed back on openg reenrollment hours calls for an eight week period where people can can get  Berrian rolled   the Affordable Care Act  I just thk  dr. Frieden you've been obviously  the Obama admistration very volved  the Affordable Care Act but I thk that's important to note I mean what you just talked through is that's it's a long process glad that we're seeg some encouragg news out  the the treatment  the hospitals one asked you also about behavioral health if you can talk a little bit about that from a public health perspective what we're seeg as far as what's happeng with behavioral health what we need to prepare for gog forward  just what we can do as members  the Labor Health  Human Services subcommittee  appropriations as we look at that maybe we'll start with you dr. rivers yes I thk this is an important area gog back to our previous discussions about the secondary consequences  this pemic  the support  treatment  contuity  care that people have had I thk behavioral health is one area that is chronically underserved  under supported  I thk it's very possible that  the context  this pemic that those disparities will tensify I would just outle four areas  concern the first is terruption  needed care either ongog care or need for a new care  a behavioral health area second is substance abuse  chemical dependency they need for treatment  potential creased need for treatment  care the acute trauma  grievg  losg family members or family members severely ill  also the responders first responders  health care workers I was health commissioner  New York City after 9/11  we studied the impact  the  Trade Center attacks  we found that as severe as the respiratory impacts were  people caught  a dust cloud  terms  the amount  disability posttraumatic stress disorder depression  anxiety caused even more disabilities we have to take care  our responders durg this time  limit their hours to the extent possible  provide good care  support I'm livg Herrera Butler thank you madam chair you know on that last part with regard to mental health   the impact this is havg not just on our first responders although they are constantly  our hearts  mds because they're the ones that are takg it takg it  2/7 one  the thgs I thk with regard to you know congressman Harris's comments about kd  a nuanced approach to reopeng I've just recently called on the federal government to reopen so Washgton State we've we've been dialg it we dialed back we're startg to dial back open  this governor has reopened state state parks or at least he's put he's dog them  a phased approach hope people are able to leave their house go to a safe place that has a lot  space  distance but it has an impact especially you have family you know kids you're all  the house together  it lets them release a little bit I've just recently asked that the feds reopened the federal l  our area because they closed it f   cooperation with the state when it made the close shut down order so now I thk it's time to start openg those thgs f up I would like to know on the recreational side what types  thgs you see as nothg's 100% safe let's go ahead  throw that out but could help out balance out the the mental health piece you know I've been thkg  beg very concerned about domestic violence  violence with regard to children you know the reports have gone way down because they're not  school  school you know educators aren't able to see thgs  make calls it's not that they're not happeng so could you please speak to the health piece with regard to read openg some  these thgs I agree that outdoor areas are low risk for transmission  that there play a really important role  mental health  overall wellbeg  so I do support the reopeng  those outdoor areas complete agreement would encourage actually that the only thgs you want to be careful about is where do people go after they go outdoors that they congregate  a bar side  are there any thgs like doorknobs or spaces that are just can be easily reengeered to be safer   addition I thk as that public is more educated I don't I don't see anybody who I mean most people carry around h sanitizer right you you use it before you touch your before you eat so you take your own lunch you go sit out there you're gonna gather up all your garbage you're gonna put your h sanitizers around before you mean people I thk I thk we need to beg to show the American people that we are seeg  hearg their stress  not just the folks who are  the middle  the fight but those who are  rural areas those are held back you know we're almost a victim  our success  certa ways that we haven't had it I'm so grateful  we've worked very hard to not allow our local health systems  my district to be overwhelmed but because that isn't happeng people aren't seeg the immediacy  the crisis  we have to respond to them  that  so that's I thk that new wants especially comg from our public health experts is gonna help us I thk it'll help  the long term with regard to adherence but it'll ga some trust the other the other thg I wanted to brg up  asked about was nursg homes obviously that is a hot spot  then they contue to be a significant portion  our kovat patients  Cova deaths cludg I thk that's not just  my ear it's it's nationwide a high number  those patients who travel three times a week to dialysis or nursg home the two diocese are nursg home residents  this figure could crease durg the pemic what special protections can can we be lookg at for these dividuals for them  for the staff a lot  how these viruses have been spread origally could have been visitors but now they're really only their own outside act it's health care providers /or their staff we've talked a lot about testg  when we should test  where we should test for me this is a really appropriate opportunity to do that Universal testg I thk that all staff who are workg  care settgs should have access to tests  should be tested regularly for that exact purpose we know that nursg home residents are a very high risk  severe illness the virus spreads very easily  those settgs  so I thk that is the perfect opportunity to tervene I just completely agree I'm deeply concerned about nursg homes  fact exactly two months ago I said that nursg homes were ground zero for Cova 19  the US  as I said  my openg statement unless urgent action has taken there will be at least a hundred thous deaths  nursg homes  this country  that means takg a comprehensive approach makg sure there's leadership  the nursg home at every level every unit every shift makg sure we take a hierarchy  controls cludg source controls admistrative engeerg  personal controls cohortg staff  patients comg up with novel ways to try to keep staff  patients safe some nursg homes are payg staff after to stay there so they're not exposg others that's a very costly  difficult thg to do if if it turns out that antibodies reflect immunity maybe we can have people who have immunity care for others  nursg all we have to do somethg so that we don't have that kd  terrible devastation thank you you'll back mentor congresswoman Watson call me thank you liberated thank you folks um this has been a tremendous learng experience for me I wanted to ask you a couple  questions about our sense  connectivity to the rest  the world what do you thk for stance is the true impact  the decision that our president made to withhold fundg to the  Health Organization what do you thk that that has  terms  a shortterm midterm or even longterm negative implication we're  the midst  the most severe public health endemic  a century who is our global health organization  we need to support it  make it stronger I thk we can look with time to see do we need a different approach do we need a supplemental approach what are ways that it could be more effective I thk every organization will need to look back  see how it could have been more effective but the who has a critical role to play  we hope it will be able to play that with evercreasg effectiveness  the weeks months  years to come I wonder if you wanted to weigh  doctor I'll just add that we know from this experience  from everythg we know about fectious diseases that a threat anywhere  the world is also a threat to the United States  so but I also like to pot out that it's  our national terest to make sure that the rest  the world is able to respond effectively  whuoh is the tool that we have to do that  to ensure that thank you another question I have about  support  all my colleagues have spoken to the need for a national plan cohesiveness  how we approach it how we deal with it through all the various phases  how we can create hopefully more dependability by havg a national plan what is your reaction to the proposal to shut down the task force the coronavirus task force is it an okay thg is it problematic what should we be thkg about I would say it depends what comes next at resolved save lives an itiative  the  Health Organization vital strategies we advise governments all over the world  how to prepare for  respond to an epidemic  one  the essential components  an effective response is a clear what's called cident management system where there is an cident manager  charge there is transparent formation the cident manager reports up to the highest authority  raises the policy decisions that need to be made which are then made  implemented through the cident management system that is the best practice  how to hle an emergency like this so whatever structure is there I would hope it would follow that best practice I thk that that has been one  our challenges is that we've had so many people on the same base at the same time just takg out little pieces  sometimes collidg with one another as they're tryg to get to home plate  so to me it's very important that we have a cohesive plan  action a one voice  an agreement among all  the agencies that would be puttg to that I my other question has to do with the the mority communities the black community the ive Americans Hispanic  the very poor communities a lot  their access to health care has been dimished because  the health care facilities the FQHCs  stuff not operatg to par if at all how what do we need to do to ensure that they are not deprived  either the therapies or the vacce once it becomes available to the degree that the fection has disproportionately impacted those communities we've seen three problems one larger proportion  essential workers  some underrepresented communities to higher proportion  diabetes under controlled diabetes  other underlyg health conditions  three lesser access to healthcare services if  when we have a vacce it needs to be provided to those who need it most first that would be health care workers  other essential workers  as its rolled out to everyone everyone  society because that will protect you all  us I agree with dr. Frieden  I would just add that although we do not have a safe  effective vacce yet that's the kd  thkg  planng that we can  should be dog now so that we can really take our time to identify the best way forward thank you   fally I just want to say that I was really impressed with this discussion that you both approached at some pot about lookg forward  beg prepared for Disease X that's gog to come along I thk that we are very fortunate no we're not we're not fortunate with what we're experiencg right now although I suspect it could be worse but this is pretty doggone bad  we have the smartest country  a whole wide world as far as I'm concerned there was amazg country  the whole wide world  we ought to be better positioned should there become  when there becomes another cident  this nature or anythg close to it thank you I yield back thank you with you with the agreement  the rankg member what I would like to do is as I mentioned that we have members who could not be here so  I know that there are three members on our side  the aisle have had a question which I'd like to pose on their behalf  I don't thk that's there any further questions that correct thank you okay so let me  I'll try to give you the the sense  the  the question a congressman mark Pocan  Wiscons his question is  order to safely we open our communities experts like dr. Gottlieb  recommended beg able to consistently test 1%  our population every week 50,000 that means  Wiscons 50,000 tests per week do you feel that the federal government should play a role  helpg States secure testg supplies so they can safely reopen what should we fed Ehrman do to take to ensure our communities have testg  the contact tracg capacity they need to safely address the pemic are the guideles from CDC on who should be prioritized accurate  your view are they missg anyone such as essential workers folks workg at factory still or are first responders  I would add to that list I'm sure mark wouldn't md because one  the questions I wanted to ask is about our folks who are  the meat  poultry poultry processg plants  the president is designatg meat  poultry processg plants as essential frastructure that must stay open now I don't know about everyone here sure maybe but I have been to both the poultry processg place  a meat processg place you just watch how those people are stg right next to each other as either chickens or beef just go by  so how do we deal with them as well so let me lay that one out yes I do thk the federal government should play a role  obtag testg supplies for the states what we don't want is a situation where all 50 states are havg to devise their own strategies  biddg agast each other  we really need a central coordatg function  order to make that run smoothly  I thk the same largely goes for contact tracg  that the federal government plays an important role  issug guidance  supportg state  local health department's  dog this work but our public health  the United States really does happen at the state  local level  so I do thk it's appropriate that those functions be carried out at those levels the CDC testg priorities largely revolve around people who are hospitalized first  foremost with code like symptoms those with symptoms who don't require hospitalization health care workers  I do thk those are appropriate testg priorities given our limited resources but that's not to say that people  these essential roles like those workg  manufacturg  meatpackg facilities should not become essential it's just a matter  gettg our testg capacity to the pot that we are able to support that I would agree with all  that  just request that we issued a brief on exactly this question just two pages on who should be tested how many are  each group  what the level  prioritization is  if we can enter that tegrally  close agreement with the CDC recommendation  you also have besides the the meat  poultry processg plants prisons have become now a place that we really need to look to thank you on behalf  our colleague Lucille roybalallard this is about CDC authority  she talks about you dr. Frieden you have been the CDC has been an authoritative voice  the country to prevent the spread  fectious disease back  January February we were learng about the the novel coronavirus CDC leadership particularly dr. Mercer  dr. Redfield were present several days a week  testifyg  heargs providg guidance however once the stay at home efforts began CDC became disturbgly absent  their visibility silent  their recommendations I mean just paraphrase to consider problematic that the the task force contaed one CDC representative  for the most part the briefgs are the last two months dr. Redfield was not vited to be part  the presentation given your own experience is it normal that CDC's not be more directive  response to the outbreaks  meat processg plants federal directives that these plants stay open even when they do not have protocols  place to protect workers should CDC be matg the use  face masks  public venues sistg that face masks be made available to all dividuals  durg stores  other public places what role should CDC be playg  addressg this tragic epidemic  kovat  our nursg homes all about the CDC dr. Frieden but would you know first to say that CDC has 20,000 health pressionals who dedicate their lives to protectg Americans the ional Center for immunization  respiratory disease has more than 700 FTE staff who are experts  this area they have spent decades workg on the public health control  respiratory viruses doctor  shook at the prcipal deputy director was the former director  that Center  addition to beg the prcipal deputy  CDC dr. B Sonia is the current director  that Center others  that Center are deeply experienced  deeply committed to this  many parts  CDC also have deep expertise  fection control for example  nursg home care CDC is is not does not have the authority to mate CDC provides guidance but I will say that even as I am an fectious disease specialist I have spent 30 years on fectious disease control I've run two large public health agencies I would not take action without detailed put from the experts at CDC because they are the world talk top experts  this  I will feel safer when we're hearg from them regularly but I would also say that the American people have voted with their clicks because by this date CDC's website has had somethg like 1. billion clicks  it's still the best place to go for formation advice guidance  recommendations to keep you your family your workplace your school your daycare safer  essentially what that would mean though if that's if you see cannot mate we underst that but certaly I can image  New York time with regard to these meat  poultry processg plants that you worked closely with OSHA  with the USDA on these issues as well as state health department's to what to make these happens but you were  effect leadg the way is the pot that CDC took a major role  this effort  that is with the guideles as well which is why I ask the question are we you can't mate this but are we implementg everywhere  this country the CDC guideles with responses to testg  I thk the answer to that is no but  any case I don't know if you want to comment on the CDC piece doctor thank you okay  congresswoman Lois Frankel  Florida aga this is similar to early testg is the key there's consistency on how much testg needs to be done hundreds  thouss  we are currently testg less than 200 give us aga the benchmark for the number  tests we should be dog  this country ice know it start at 3.5 million per week  go up from there next week do we have the capacity to provide this not yet what will we have to do to achieve the capacity the steps aren't clear to me but I thk that should be a priority who should determe two steps the federal government okay she has she asks based on your knowledge  the timele  the  the  the response she talked about November US telligence ficials began warng  virus sweepg through Han region   for more than 70 days from the first confirmed case  the US for the admistration to take serious action based on your knowledge  the timele  the response was there anythg more that could have been done to conta the spread  also she pots out that  May  2018  the admistration disbed the White House pemic response team later received a report warng that the US has now prepared to respond to a severe fluenza like pemic do you have an opion as to whether disbg the pemic response team was appropriate  that's was there anythg more that could have been done okay this is exactly why we need a health defense operations appropriation so that whatever the status  the budget Americans can be safer because we have a stable source  fundg to protect us from health threats at home or abroad just thkg about the first question it's always true  public health that we prefer prevention  it's easier to stay ahead  somethg than it is to rega control we have a lesson here  front  us now though as we are really  the midst  our pemic that we need to be forwardlookg  right yeah okay let me just say okay I'm gog to ask a congressman Cole if he has some closg comments  then I will close thank you very much madam chair  I want to thank both our witnesses have been exceptionally helpful testimony  very forthright  compellg answers  I appreciate you both I want to thank you madam chair for holdg this hearg as I did at the begng I thk it's a very important hearg to hold  you ask a lot  your members because this is the only reason why we're  town  I'm very pleased with all the members  the committee that we're able to come here  certaly very understg  the ones that were not but but certaly took time to submit questions I thought I might w the the prize for comg for this but my friend Jaime Herrera Butler once more showed me up I thk it's exceptional that you came with young children for this hearg  I thk all  you need to be commended but I want to pot out my my friend who came the furthest for for what she did there's a lot  good formation this hearg  I thk it really shows the reason why we need to be meetg as regularly as possible particularly on this issue I want to thank aga both  you but dr.

It’s just so hard to move troops  the\njungle so everythg slows down. Without any geographical protection  its\nborders it would be significantly easier for Vietnam, Laos, or Myanmar to vade \nthan the reverse. But  does have an advantage elsewhere.   India just aren’t good friends. y have border disputes, military conflicts,\npolitical differences, so its just hard for them to get along  that is why Tibet is\nso important. Tibet was historically its own empire; it\nwas only  the last 300 years that  took it over. Tibetan people are ethnically different from\nthe Han Chese habitg ’s east. It just doesn’t make sense for Tibet to\nbe part  … except militarily. Only 0.2%  ’s population lives \nTibet which accounts nearly 13%  the country’s area. More people live  the ner four districts\n Beijg than the entirety  Tibet. It’s just credibly desolate, but it serves\na purpose. If  didn’t rule Tibet, then India would. Maybe not formally, but there’s little chance\nthat an dependent Tibet would not be economically  culturally domated by either India or\n. It just doesn’t have enough power economically\nor militarily to resist, but  ’s view, it could not  cannot allow for an\nIndian Tibet. Indian rule  Tibet would mean that there\nwould be no geographical protection between the populated area    India because\nTibet is that geographical protection. Not only does Tibet extend ’s border\nto the Himalayas, it’s also an unpopulated area without the transportation frastructure\nneeded for an vadg India to advance a large number  troops towards eastern . But that also means that there’s not the\ntransportation frastructure necessary for  to advance towards India, but \nis tryg to change that. y recently opened the worlds highest railroad\nto Tibet, they’re buildg highways constantly,  they also opened a large airport  Nygchi\njust miles away from the border. In the near term the goal  these projects\nis to further tegrate Tibet to .  government has all but failed at wng\nover the native Tibetan population, but they can change who lives  Tibet. Hundreds  thouss  Han Chese have\nmoved to Tibet  many more visit each year.  government knows that Tibet’s usefulness\nis dimished if when a foreign military shows up the population thks that means liberation\nrather than vasion. But there’s another reason why  needs\nTibet—water. That whole eastern zone  agricultural productivity\nexists because  all the water from Tibet.  Yellow  Yangtze Rivers—’s\ntwo longest rivers—both get their water from Tibet  foreign control  the water\nsupply  the country would,  the governments md, strike a catastrophic blow to the country’s\nfood security. If there were, hypothetically, a significant\nmounta range separatg Tibet from eastern , there’s a good chance it would still\nbe dependent.  water would still come from  \nthe mountas would act as the geographical protection that  desires. But to the North is another one  ’s\nassets—Mongolia. It’s an enormous, sparsely populated, friendly\ncountry. With the gobi desert  other desolate terra,\nthere’s just little chance that any modern lbased army could make it across with\nany efficiency.  supply les would be enormously long\n by the time they got to the Chese border there would have been ample warng. But then aga, who would want to vade? Mongolia’s only other neighbor is Russia\nwhich is a friendly ally   both militarily  economically.  need not worry about its northern border\nuntil relations with Russia sour. But that leaves the eastern border. Now, you would thk that this would be ’s\nsafest border—the ocean—but you have to consider that powerful states lay just f\n’s shores, the most powerful one beg the US.  United States has a significant Pacific\nmilitary presence with bases  South Korea, Japan,  Guam. It’s also a close ally with Taiwan, Indonesia,\nSgapore,  Malaysia meang that, if a serious dispute with  occurred, the US\nwould have no problem blockadg   cuttg f its maritime access,   course,\n knows this. That’s why  has spent so much time,\nenergy,  political capital to establish sovereignty  the South  Sea by buildg\nmilitary bases  artificial isls. It knows that it needs these isls so it\nhas sovereignty over the area so that it can reach the Pacific  case  war, but ironically,\nits actions  the area are sourg its relations with the very nations that  needs on\nits side.  Philippes, for example, doesn’t have\na bulletpro relationship with the US. While the two countries are allies, Philippe\nleadership has attempted to distance themselves from the US. If  hadn’t rued its relationship\nwith the Philippes over the South  Sea dispute it could’ve won them to their\nside which would allow  crucial access to the Pacific if the US attempted a naval\nblockade. ’s entire economy relies on exports\nso restrictions to access to the oceans would lead to economic ru. With its enormous population,  also relies\non the importation  food, most  which comes on ships. Without jobs or food, there’s a good chance\nthat the population would rise up agast the government  end the current regime.  didn’t want to be a global power spreadg\nits fluence to every content until recently.

Out  the myriad problems that emerged \nthe world  Sprg 2020, there is one that is quietly beg solved—one that has to\ndo with the behdthescenes  a globalized, modernday economy. Understg it is easy. At its core, it’s a simple supply  dem\nmismatch. You see, back  March 2020, when COVID19\nreached pemic status, almost every airle  the world drastically scaled back its flyg. It varied from region to region  airle\nto airle, but the common trend everywhere was that, if any route got cut, it was almost\ncertaly a longhaul one. In the era  quarante periods, border closgs,\n other travel restrictions, there is nearzero dem for longhaul, ternational travel,\nso tercontental flights were quickly removed from airle schedules. For example,  April 2019, about 500 roundtrip\nflights per day would fly between Europe  the US, however,  April 2020, that number\nwas reduced to about 80 per day. That represents between an 80%  90% reduction. Ignorg airle revenue, you’d thk that\nthat would be a lossfree situation, though: it reduces carbon emissions, many governments\nare coverg the salaries  furloughed workers, it reduces airle expenditure,  nobody’s\nridg  the cabs anyways, but that doesn’t consider what rides below the cab. On nearly every tercontental flight, \nthe belly hold, among the hundreds  passenger bags, there is cargo. In fact, 5%  the world’s air cargo is\ncarried  this method. Now, the math to expla the supply  dem\nmismatch is simple.  proportion  cargo carried on passenger\naircraft varies from route to route, so 60%  Western Europe to US air cargo, for example,\nflies on passenger planes. 80% to 90%  transatlantic passenger flights\nare not flyg, which means that about 50%  air cargo capacity  this market has disappeared\n a matter  weeks.  situation is less severe  other markets,\nbut, dustrywide, the overall air cargo capacity reduction was about 23%  March,\n2020. So that’s the supply figure, but what about\ndem? As a huge proportion  the world entered\nvarious lockdown scenarios, economic forecasts plummeted.  extent  the fancial toll will not\nbe clear for a while, but it is clear that it is deeply negative. This all has an effect on air cargo dem. On a macro level, consumers are buyg less,\nwhich means less is shipped, which means companies are buyg less, which means less is shipped,\nwhich means suppliers are makg less, which means less is shipped. On a micro level, different jurisdictions\nworldwide differ on the exact details  their Coronavirus response, but  many places,\nfactories are shut down which means supply chas are cut. So, from an economic perspective, one would\npredict that dem would almost certaly be down, but like all thgs  the age \nCoronavirus, there is another domant perspective—that  public health. From almost the moment COVID19 emerged, it\nbecame clear that it was a highly fectious virus, which means that a crucial component\n the safe treatment  an fected dividual is the use  personal protective equipment,\nor PPE. In this context, that means, masks, shields,\ngowns,  more, which healthcare facilities always stock, but never  the quantity needed\nto cover nearly universal staff usage for a long period. That means that,  order to reduce the risk\n staff exposure, nearly every hospital  the world needed more PPE. Purely by chance, it turns out that the number\none medical PPE producg country  the world was also the first country to experience COVID19—. Before the pemic, the country produced\n20 million medical masks per day, or about half  the world’s supply. By the begng  March, though, this had\nalready been scaled up to more than 100 million per day. It was at exactly this time when, simultaneously,\n’s manufacturg dustry started to ch back to life  the virus  took\nhold  the rest  the world. With how fast COVID19 ramped up, many hospitals\n hotspots like Italy, Spa,  the US were reusg masks , even with that technique,\nwere down to only days  supply, so they needed supply from ,  other manufacturg\nhubs, as fast as possible. In the logistics world, “as fast as possible,”\nmeans air cargo. Thanks to this unprecedented  urgent dem\nfor PPE  other medical supplies, dem for air cargo only dropped by 15%  March,\n2020. Considerg air cargo capacity dropped by\n23%, that means that there was an 8% gap between supply  dem. In the context  this enormous dustry,\n8% is huge,  so the laws  supply  dem followed their course.  cost to transport goods by air spiked,\nespecially  the crucial Asia to US  Europe markets. In the last two weeks  March, air cargo\nrates from Hong Kong to North America jumped 27% above normal, while rates from Shanghai\nto Europe creased by 50%. Of course, after a supply  dem mismatch\neconomic forces push companies to crease supply, which is exactly what happened. Cargo airles that could massively ramped\nup their flights. Kalitta Air, for example, an American cargo\nairle, brought some aircraft out  storage  creased its longhaul flyg by nearly\n50%. However, there is only so much that these\ncargo airles can do. y only have so many aircraft, so many pilots,\n so many mechanics so they can’t massively ramp up their operations  a short time. Who did have extra capacity, though, were\npassenger airles,  that’s where a small solution emerged. A plane with no passengers is not necessarily\nan empty plane. An average airle earns 15% to 20%  its\nrevenue through cargo, but keep  md what an average airle looks like. Most  the average North American airles’\nflyg is domestic  shorthaul, where little cargo is carried, so the proportion  revenue\ncomg from cargo on a longhaul flight is far higher. Consider too that, on a normal longhaul passenger\nflight, a considerable portion  the cargo hold is filled with baggage so that 15 to\n20% is derived from only some  the capacity on only some flights. Airles soon realized that there was a possibility\n turng a prit flyg a passenger plane with no passengers. Now, normally, a passenger a330, for example,\nhas capacity for 38 thous pounds or 17 thous kilograms  cargo  its belly hold. That’s compared to the freighter version\n the a330 which can carry 132 thous pounds or 60 thous kilograms  freight thanks\nto its completely empty cab. That means that the passenger a330 can only\ncarry 29% as much cargo as its freighter counterpart. However, considerg that freight rates have\nrisen by as much as 50%, that means that flyg these aircraft can earn about % as much\nper flight as their freighter counterparts normally do. Makg less than half as much as cargo airles\nclearly would not make flyg passenger aircraft for cargo purposes worth it, but there is\nmore to consider. First, jet fuel prices are at an alltime\nlow, largely  response to alltime low dem.  same gallon that would have cost airles\n$2.20  January, 2020 costs about 0 cents  lateApril, 2020,  those prices are\ncontug to drop. In normal conditions, fuel is airles’\nnumber one cost so havg that drop by a factor  five reduces the cost to operate a flight\ndramatically. That means that they need to earn far less\nthan what a cargo airle does  normal conditions to breakeven. In addition, most airles are payg their\npilots  other staff anyways. In the US, for example, airles are required,\nas a condition  their government relief fundg, to not lay f or furlough any staff,\nso the margal staffg cost to operate an additional flight is mimal. Thirdly, with no passengers, airles have\nquickly novated new ways to carry cargo. Many airles have loaded their passenger\ncabs with cargo placed directly on top   fastened to seats. This dramatically creases complexity \nloadg time, but it also dramatically creases capacity. l  these conditions  circumstances\ncombe to the pot that, for this brief moment  time, economics dictate that an\nairle can turn a prit flyg a passenger plane without passengers.  airles like American Airles, Air Canada,\nLufthansa,  Air New Zeal began cargoonly flights—so many,  fact, that United airles,\nfor example, had up to dozens  passengerless passenger planes airborne at the same time\nall around the world. This also created flights that have never\nhappened before, like a 16hour nonstop cargoonly trip from Sydney to Toronto by Air Canada. But it wasn’t all just big airles on long\nflights. Smaller airles too got  on the game. Air Greenl started a lk on a ty propeller\nDash8 to transport Coronavirus tests for processg  a Danish lab, Titan airways\nflew medical supplies to the remote isl  St Helena on a passenger a318,  Wizz\nAir flew their passenger a321’s to Shanghai via Kazakstan to transport medical supplies\nto Hungary. se circumstances have also led to a dramatic\nreshufflg  rank  order  the aviation world.  list  the world’s busiest airports,\n terms  annual aircraft movements, is normally headed by Atlanta, followed by Chicago,\nLos Angeles, Dallas, Beijg,  a number  other major hub airports. Normally, you wouldn’t expect an airport\nfrom America’s third least populous state anywhere on the first pages  that list,\nhowever, for a brief moment  April, 2020, that was the case. Anchorage airport,  aska, became the world’s\nbusiest airport thanks to its strategic location. It has long been a busy cargo airport as it\nacts as stopover pot for cargo flights from Asia to North America. y stop here because it is more efficient\nfor aircraft, on longhaul flights, to take less fuel  more cargo  refuel halfway\nthrough than fly nonstop to their destation. so,  some cases, freight is sorted \nexchanged between aircraft  Anchorage. In April 2020, the US ranked number one \nthe world for new  total Coronavirus cases, so it had a tremendous need for medical supplies,\nwhich are overwhelmgly produced  Asia, so hundreds  cargo aircraft per day passed\nthrough Anchorage on their way between Asia  the US. So, while every other major airport  the\nUS fell to relative silence, Anchorage was busier than ever. re is, however, one fal issue that the\nair cargo world is facg. Beyond the shortterm issue  too much dem,\nthe longterm issue is that this dem will not last.  air cargo dem closely tracks with\nglobal economic health. Every dicator suggests that the economy\nwill not emerge from the COVID19 pemic even close to as strong as when it entered,\nso there will undoubtably be some slow months  years for air cargo. Once urgent dem for medical supplies eases,\n buyers have the time to switch to slower forms  shippg, the air cargo world will\nalmost certaly follow the fate  its passengercarryg colleagues.

In 200 the American Highway Users liance\npublished an article claimg that the Katy freeway  Houston, Texas was the second most\ncongested road  America. Drivers spent a combed 25. million hours\nevery year sittg  traffic on that road. That’s 36 lifetimes worth. It was an absolute embarrassment  a road\nfor Texas so they decided to spend $2.8 billion to exp it to 28 lanes makg it the widest\nhighway  the world. l this extra capacity would surely fix the\nproblem—more lanes means more room for more cars which means shorter travel times... right? Unfortunately not. Between 2011  201 alone, travel times\non the Katy freeway creased by up to 55%. It now takes an average  6 mutes to drive\nthe 28 miles between downtown Houston  Katyl durg the afternoon rush hour. That’s up from 1 mutes  2011.  problem with this project was that the\nsolution violated the fundamental law  road congestion—more lanes mean more traffic. This probably seems countertuitive.  more lanes there are the higher the capacity\na road has so cars should be able to drive faster... but that’s a very narrow analysis\n the problem. You can’t just thk about how this would\nwork on one road, you have to thk about it  the context  a whole city. Many people choose not to drive places because\n how long it takes. If the traffic is bad, they can take public\ntransit or wait until a less busy time, or just not travel at all. When a road is exped, travel times itially\ndecrease so all those people who chose not to drive or to take an alternate route or\nwhatever decide to switch to usg that newly exped road. What’s fascatg about roads is that this\nhappens at a perfect 1 to 1 ratio. If the capacity  a road doubles, the amount\n people usg that road will also double. If it doubles aga, the amount will aga\ndouble. Of course if you kept dog this over \nover aga you would eventually build a big enough road that there wouldn’t be any more\ncars to fill the road, but  the real world where dem for roads far outstrips supply,\ndrivers will adjust to any change  road capacity. So does that mean that it’s hopeless? Is there no way to solve traffic? No way to make our roads better  safer\n more efficient? Well... no. re’s plenty we can do. Here’s the thg about traffic—it slows\ndown exponentially.  20,000 car on the road slows down traffic\noverall significantly more than the 5,000 car. This is a major driver for a lot  jams—a\nsmall addition  cars leads to a large addition  congestion—but it also makes solvg\ntraffic a bit easier sce you only need to remove a small amount  cars from the road\n that’s just what ramp meters do. Ramp meters are set up on the onramps \nhighways to restrict the amount  people gettg on the highway. y usually let one car on every five or\nsix seconds. Sce the amount  cars actually on the highway\nis kept down, the highway stays at its most efficient speed. Mnesota did an experiment where they shut\ndown their longused ramp meters for eight weeks  order to see if they actually worked\n they found that the highway capacity decreased by 9%, travel times creased by 22%, speeds\ndropped by 7%,  crashes creased by 26%. Stockholm, Sweden used that exponential nature\n traffic to decrease travel times by up to 0%  2006. Stockholm as a city lies across 1 isls\nwhich means that all the bridges act as huge chokepots. Traffic, therefore, was historically horrible\nfor the relatively small city. On January 3rd, 2006, Stockholm started to\ncharge drivers who entered this central perimeter—the busiest area.  charge wasn’t much—between 10 \n20 krona, the equivalent  1  2 US dollars— but it was enough to persuade 20%  drivers\nto not enter the central perimeter. y either went downtown on public transport\nor walked or didn’t go at all. se are the amounts  daily drivers \nthe perimeter  the years leadg up to the charge. As soon as the charge was implemented  2006,\nthe daily amount dropped down to here. It wasn’t a fluke. After the 6 month itial trial period drivg\n the central core became free aga  the amount  daily drivers creased to nearly\nthe level it was before. When the charge became permanent  2007,\ndaily numbers once aga plummeted. Even though the charge was muscule, it was\nenough to dissuade 10s  thouss  people from usg those roads. re are really two costs  drivg—the\nmoney  the time. When the time it takes to drive isn’t enough\n a cost to prevent people from drivg, these charges crease the overall cost to\na level where some people will decide not to drive. But what about safety? Roads are still unbelievably dangerous. In any given year, 1 out  every 10,000 people\n the US die  a car accident. Just thk about how high  a proportion\nthat is. If you go to a Redsks game at FedEx field\nnear Washgton, DC, eight  the people sittg  the sts with you will die  the next\nyear  a car accident. It turns out one  the best ways to prevent\naccidents is with somethg you’ve almost certaly already seen or used—the roundabout. re’s a reason you see these more \nmore. Roundabouts reduce deaths  serious juries\nby 90%. That is not an error. With roundabouts, there’s almost no opportunity\nfor the worst type  collision—the head on full speed crash. In a traditional tersection, cars come with\nfeet  each other while gog at a relative speed  up to 100 mph. A headon crash at that speed is undoubtedly\ncatastrophic. With roundabouts, cars naturally slow down\nto about 1525 miles per hour sce they’re gog around a curve. so, if there were to be a collision, it\nwould either be a sideimpact collision if a car failed to turn to the circle or a\nsidetoside collision if a car misjudged the curve. Both  these collisions happen at a low relative\nspeed so fatalities are low. But what about capacity? Surely the lowerspeed roundabouts cause horrible\ntraffic problems. Well... they don’t. A sgle lane roundabout can hle a maximum\n 1800 vehicles per hour which is exactly the same as a traditional twolane signaled\ntersection. While cars will move through a signaled tersection\nat a much higher speed, they have to wait both for the light to change  leftturng\ncars. With roundabouts, you have a smooth, consistent,\nalbeit slower, flow. So what’s the problem? Why haven’t we replaced every tersection\nwith a roundabout? Well there are disadvantages—they’re more\ndifficult for pedestrians, especially those who are deaf or bld, they require a larger\nfootprt, they’re more expensive to mata—but the real reason roundabouts are not ubiquitous\nnowadays is because  the biggest fallacy  road design—that drivers need rules. Poynton, just outside  Manchester, , used\nto have a typical, rather dreary tersection  nobody really liked it. Cars would back up for miles, pedestrians\nhad to wait forever for the light to change,  it essentially split the town apart. So someone had the idea to remove the traffic\nlights, remove the zebra crossgs, the curbs, remove almost every safety device  the tersection\n just set up two adjog roundabouts. Surely this would wreak havoc, but it didn’t. Turns out, when people are uncomfortable,\nwhen people aren’t really sure what’s gog on, they pay more attention.  green light was a signal to people that\nthe road was clear, that it was safe to speed, that they could let their guard down, but\nafter the change the cars were able to flow freely, albeit at a slow pace, stead \nwaitg for the lights to change. Pedestrian cidents went down, collisions\nwent down, traffic flowed faster,  the city center fally had some character. So, all around the world cities are replicatg\nwhat Poynton did. y’re removg curbs, traffic lights,\n pedestrian crossgs to make one shared space. l around the world, these streets are resultg\n fewer accidents  more pedestrian space. Discomfort is savg lives. On a larger scale, there’s one more novative\ntersection design that’s begng to save lives—the divergg diamond terchange. This terchange is designed as a way to get\nmore cars on  f highways faster. After the onramp to the right side, the road\ncrosses over so cars never have to traverse active lanes to get onto the highway. A car headg north can effortlessly jo\nthe onramp without crossg traffic,  a car headg south will cross over so it\ndrives on the left side  can effortlessly jo the onramp to head south. Not only is this easier for drivers, it improves\nsafety.  dangerousness  an tersection is ten\nrated by determg the number  conflict pots—possible pots where accidents could\nhappen under normal circumstances. With a traditional onramp tersection there\nare 26. With a divergg diamond tersection, only\n1. And they’re faster too.  US Department  Transportation found\n a study that universally, whether the traffic was light or heavy, divergg diamond terchanges\nlet more cars through faster. It costs less too. A traditional onramp tersection requires\n$11.3 million to build; a divergg diamond tersection, only $5.7 million. re are really no major disadvantages to\nthis tersection so nearly 100  them have been built to date  more  more are beg\nstalled each month. As good as these solutions sound, there’s\nno one way to solve traffic.  difference between cities with chronic\ntraffic problems  those without is a combation  smart policies  designs that mitigate\nthe effects  havg more road dem than supply. But traffic won’t just fix itself so until\ncities at least experiment with solutions we’re all condemned to traffic, forever. This video was made possible by Blue Apron.

Assumg each town has the exact same shops\n services, rational people will just go to whichever town is closest to buy or sell\ngoods. Towns ten miles apart mean that nobody has\nto travel more than five miles to reach a town. Each one  these towns was founded before\nthe formation  the United States, so that means that,  course, nobody had cars \npretty much everybody walked everywhere. 10 miles, or 5 miles each way, is about the\ndistance a person can comfortably walk  a day with enough time to buy or sell goods\nat a central market. Back  this era before cars, a 5 mile radius\nwas essentially the largest possible commuter zone to small agricultural towns  therefore\nhavg towns ten miles apart was the most efficient possible use  rural l. When you get a chance, take a look at map\n a rural area that existed before cars. You’ll see that the distance between mediumsized\ntowns is almost always somewhere between about 10 to 15 miles. Because the Cumberl valley is a valley,\ntowns really could only develop  a le, but  most cases towns develop  all directions. This is what the ten mile rule looks like\ngog out  all directions. Each  these pots is a town  the hexagon\naround it is the area from which people will go to the town. In the real world, each  these towns probably\nhas a small grocery store, a pharmacy, a bank,  maybe a restaurant. Sce everybody uses these services, there\ndoesn’t have to be many people  a towns sphere  fluence  order to susta these\nshops. But where do you put somethg more specialized,\nlike a mechanic. People only need to go the mechanic every\nonce  a while so you need more people to susta one mechanics shop than one grocery\nstore. Well, some  these small towns develop to\nlarger towns with more people that can support more specialized shops  services. Puttg these larger towns with more specialized\nshops closer together would be unsustaable sce there wouldn’t be enough people gog\nto those shops but puttg them farther apart would be efficient sce there’s l\nthat people would not go to a city from. This happens once or twice more until you\nhave cities. se cities have the largest spheres  fluence\n the most specialized shops. You  course still have grocery stores \npharmacies  cities, but you also have thgs like luxury car dealerships, bra surgery\ncenters,  airports.  city’s sphere  fluence is enormous\nbecause people will travel hundreds  miles to buy an expensive car or get bra surgery\nor fly from an airport.  about it with a city. How far would you walk to buy a latte. Probably only a few blocks  that’s why\nyou see Starbucks or other cfee shops on almost every block. Sce almost everyone buys cfee, you only\nneed a few blocks  people to susta one cfee shop. But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook? Probably quite far sce its a frequent\n substantial purchase. That’s why Apple stores are rather rare\neven  cities. You need an enormous amount  people to susta\none Apple store  we can actually figure out roughly how many. In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is\nabout 20 miles away from the New Haven store to the northeast  the Stamford store to\nthe southwest. In the 10 mile radius around the Trumbull\nApple Store there are about half a million habitants which tells us that you need about\nhalf a million people to susta one Apple store. We can compare that to the Starbucks’ \nlower Manhattan which are spread out at an average distance  about 600 feet. Drawg a 300 foot radius around one Starbucks\n lower Manhattan covers around 6,000 people which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000\npeople to susta it. Of course both Connecticut  New York are\nplaces with higher than average comes which means less people are needed to susta one\nStarbucks or Apple Store.  numbers would be very different , say,\nrural Kansas, but sce each store generally only builds  areas with higherthanaverage\ncomes this gives a good sense  how many people Apple  Starbucks looks for  an\narea before openg up a store. So, our model shows where cities should be,\nbut its not like this  reality. This is the most efficient spread  cities\nif you’re assumg that the cities are on a perfectly flat plane with no geographic\nfeatures, no social fluences, no variability  come, equal distribution  resources—essentially\nassumg the world is one homogeneous place… which its not. In reality,  course, our world has an enormous\neffect on where  why cities develop. To start out, let’s cut this down to one\ncity on a flat, featureless plane for simplicity. What affects the location  cities more than\nanythg is water. If we put an ocean on one side  our isotropic\nplane, our city will almost certaly locate near it. Oceans have always been  still are what\nconnects the world. re’s no other means  transport that\ncan move such enormous amounts  cargo for so little. Any city needs to be economically efficient\nto grow  it will cost more to brg goods to a city that’s 1000 miles l than\none right by the ocean. Just look at Europe. 6  the 10 largest European cities are with\n100 miles  the coast. But oceans aren’t the only bodies  water\nto affect cities. Rivers are just as or perhaps even more fluential. Milan, the 19th largest European city, is\nthe largest to not be either directly on the ocean or on a river,  even then its only\n15 miles from a river  75 miles from the ocean. Until the last century or so, cities could\nnot survive without direct water access. If you need more pro, 1  the 15 largest\ncities  the world are with a few dozen miles  the ocean. Perhaps the most obvious attractor for cities\nis resources, so gog back to our isotropic plane, puttg natural resources anywhere\non this map will draw cities near it. Cities that existed before the last century\nor so generally sprung up right near the resources, much like Pittsburgh, sce they acted as\nmanufacturg  transportation hubs for those resources, but more recently new resource\ndependent cities don’t need to be as close to the resources themselves. New transportation technologies can brg\nthe resources from their source. Just look at Dubai. Of course the UAE has enormous oil deposits,\nbut they’re much closer to    the SouthWest than Dubai. In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 residents, less\nthan half that  Carlisle, Pennsylvania—one  the farmg towns we talked about at the\nbegng. That only grew to 0,000 by 1960, but today\nits known worldwide  has more than 2.5 million residents. It was able to grow at this enormous rate—even\nfaster than  —sce it cemented itself as the economic  admistrative\nhub for the oil dustries  the region. Another geographic feature that we can add\nto the plane is mountas. Now, mountas don’t always have a uniform\naffect on cities. Mexico City, Bogota,  Addis Ababa are all\nenormous cities at elevations above 7,000 feet. Mountas do make transport  trade difficult,\nbut they also provide protection. Many ancient cities grew  these locations\nsce they were easy to protect, which left more time to focus on growg the city, but\nmountas can also hder development. For quite a while, the United States could\nnot develop west  the Appalachian mountas. y just served as an enormous barrier. In 1800, the average center  population\nfor the entire United States was here even though the US had sovereignty over this entire\narea. Of course technology eventually conquered\nthis barrier  moved the mean population center all the way out to Missouri today,\nbut if the Appalachian mountas didn’t exist American history  geography would\nbe completely different. We would have seen urban development much\nearlier  the midwest. But mountas can have another effect. You see, coal, silver, gold,  other meral\ndeposits are all ten located  mountaous regions, , just like Dubai, cities can\ndevelop  less hospitable  easy places due to resources.  economic advantage  exploitg the resources\noverpowers the economic disadvantage  beg  an hospitable location. Denver, Colorado grew 650% between 1870 \n1880 with the openg  a railroad branch connectg with the transcontental railroad. It served as an access pot to transportation\nto the gold mers  the rockies. So mountas can either push cities away or\nbrg them nearer—it really just depends on the circumstance. Let’s exchange our isotropic plane for a\nworld map. Where should cities be on here? Well, our world’s cities are not necessarily\nall  the most geographically efficient locations. While there is a certa level  natural\nselection that grows the efficiently placed cities  shrks the efficiently placed\ncities, humans are not always able to put cities  the most efficient locations. Let’s put up the 22 cities  the world\nwith a population over 2 million. You can immediately see some patterns. Puttg up the equator, you can see a clear\ndivide. Only 32  these cities lie  the southern\nhemisphere. One might thk this is because there is so\nmuch more l  the northern hemisphere, but that’s not entirely true. You see, the southern hemisphere still has\n32%  the world’s l, but only has 1%  the world’s large cities. re’s clearly a higher density  cities\n the northern hemisphere. You can pretty much trace this all back to\nEurope  Asia.  first large civilizations  empires\nwere on these two contents even though the human race likely origated  Africa. re’s hundreds  different theories on\nwhy civilizations succeeded  some places  failed  others, but one  the more\nplausible  terestg theories is that Europe  Asia succeeded because they’re\nwide stead  tall.  very shape  the contents may have\nchanged the course  human history. You see, when a content is wide, you have\na ton  l with roughly the same climate. Climate tends to change when you go north\n south rather than east  west as a nature  how the earth rotates around the sun. Much  the success  early civilizations\nhad to do with the domestication  plants  animals  the correspondg technology. When expg horizontally, the climate is\nsimilar enough that an empire can use the same successful plants  animals, while\nexpg vertically requires the domestication  new plants  animals. If a civilization started  centralamerica,\nfor example, there would be very little l on the content with a similar climate \ntheir expansion would be severely limited. In Europe  Asia, on the other h, theres\nthouss upon thouss  miles  similar climate that can be reached just by travelg\neast or west. re’s evidence to back this up. Just look at the maps  the four largest\nearly empires—the Qg Dynasty, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate,  the\nMongol empire. y were all  Eurasia  they all exped\nhorizontally. When some  the more modern empires exped,\nthey had the technology to do so overseas.  three major modern empires were the British,\nSpanish,  French empires—each  which came from relatively similar climates. A major reason why America was able to succeed\nis because all the agriculture from Europe worked there. Climatically, Europe  America are nearly\nidentical.  majority  developed colonized countries\nare  the northern hemisphere just because they were closest to Europe, but formerly\nBritish countries like South Africa, Australia,  New Zeal are all highly developed \n the Southern Hemisphere. ir success over more northern countries\n the southern hemisphere can also be partially attributed to their greater climate similarity\nto Europe. Let’s ask one more question. If our world only had one city, where would\nit logically be? Well if you take the location  every person\n the world  average it out, you come to southcentral Asia. That means that this general region is the\noptimum place to live on the planet, but where more specifically should our world city go. Well, this region is already  the Northern\nHemisphere   Eurasia, so we’ve already covered those two criteria. We want a place with a hundred  so miles\n the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountas with rich meral deposits—the sgle best\nplace for a city on earth just might be… Dhaka, Bangladesh. Every geographic model  theory says that\nthere is no better place on earth to put a city than here. re’s evidence to back this up: Dhaka\nis between the th  18th largest metropolitan area on earth dependg on how you defe\nmetropolitan area,  Bangladesh is the sixth densest country on earth—there are 161 million\npeople livg  an area about the size  Engl. History has affected geography enough that\nthe largest  most advanced civilizations are not all  SouthCentral Asia, but if\nwe started all over aga, did humanity a second time, every geographic model says that\nthis region could be the orig  central pot  human civilization.

Embassies are the vessels through which diplomacy\nis conducted. y are the physical manifestations  countries\nabroad are they are crucial tools  the field  ternational relations. se can range  size from ty, like the\n embassy  Mongolia which only has a hful  staff, to enormous, like the US embassy\n Baghdad—a complex physically as large as the Vatican City which reached a peak \n16,000 staff durg the Iraq War. , fluential countries will have embassies\nto almost every other country—the US, for example, has diplomatic missions to every\nUN recognized country  the world except St Kitts  Nevis, Antigua  Barbuda, Domica,\nSt Lucia, St Vcent  the Grenades, Grenada, GueaBissau, Iran, Bhutan,  North Korea. Smaller, less fluential countries, on the\nother h, might only have a few embassies—Tuvalu, for example, only has diplomatic missions\nto New Zeal, Fiji, Taiwan, the European Union  Belgium,  the United ions \nNew York. You see, there are embassies to nonstate\norganizations—namely the UN  EU. You can even have embassies to agencies \nthe UN—there’s one US diplomat  Rome with the lengthy title , “United States\nAmbassador to the United ions Agencies for Food  Agriculture.” Even traditionally closed f countries like\nNorth Korea have representation abroad.  DPRK has embassies  some quite western\ncountries like Germany, Sweden,  the   these three countries also each have embassies\n North Korea. Now, part  the way these embassies can exist\n even the most different  opposg  countries is because  how they are codified\n ternational law. Every UN member state except for South Sudan,\nPalau,  the Solomon Isls has signed the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. This sets out a number  laws on how embassies\nwork. Perhaps the most significant  well known\nis Article 22—“ premises  the mission shall be violable.” Unless vited by the ambassador or their\ngovernment, any representative  the host country’s government—be it a police ficer,\ngovernment ficial, member  the military, or even firefighter—cannot enter the embassy. This,  course, is how Julian Assange stayed\n the Ecuadorian Embassy  London for seven years. He entered  2012 when he was wanted  the\n for extradition to  subsequent arrest  Sweden. Assange stayed  the embassy while his request\nfor Ecuadorian political asylum was reviewed , once it was granted, normally the next\nstep would be to go to Ecuador. Outside the embassy, though, waited British\npolice  so he would therefore have been arrested if he ever left. In the end, though, after seven years side,\nit was the British police that arrested Assange as the Ecuadorians decided Assange had overstayed\nhis welcome  vited the police side.  Vienna convention also lays out a few\nother important rules for embassies—the diplomats  the embassy are exempt from\nall taxes  the host country; the diplomats are allowed free movement around the host\ncountry; an embassy can have diplomatic couriers carryg diplomatic bags which cannot be seized\nor searched; diplomats are granted diplomatic immunity; the residences  diplomats are\nalso treated as an extension  the embassy  cannot be entered without permission;\ndiplomats cannot work or earn a prit when  their host country except for with the\nembassy;  then there are plenty  other even more mor rules\nNow, one big misconception about embassies is that this is an embassy. It’s not, this is a chancery—the buildg\n which an embassy is located. , “embassy” is not the buildg, its\nthe group people that work side the buildg. It is the group  workers that represent\nthe country abroad. Another big misconception about embassy buildgs\nare that they are the sovereign territory  the country they represent. This is not the case. It is also not they case that embassy buildgs\nare  a state  extraterritoriality—that local laws don’t apply there as would be\nthe case  the United ion headquarters or on many foreign military bases. In the case  embassy buildgs, it’s not\nthat the laws  the host country don’t apply there, it’s just that many  the\npeople that make up the embassy, the diplomats, cannot be prosecuted for violatg those laws\n those that enforce the law, the police, can’t enter. Now, diplomats almost always follow the rules\n their host country as failg to do so would be unproductive for the very nature\n their job, but when they don’t, this can have serious implications. As an example,  April 198, two students\n Tripoli, Libya were hung for publicly opposg Gaddafi. In response, a protest was formed by a major\npolitical opposition group outside the Libyan embassy  London. On order from Gaddafi, an dividual side\nthe embassy buildg fired to the crowd with a mache gun, woundg eleven. One  those wounded was Yvonne Fletcher,\na young policewoman, who later died  the hospital from her juries. With 10 mutes  the shots gog f,\nthe embassy buildg was surrounded by British police, blockg anyone from gog  or out. Once it had been confirmed through forensic\nautopsy that the shots did deed come from the embassy, negotiations began.  British tried to get permission to enter\nthe embassy buildg. You see, only some, but not all  the 30\npeople  the buildg were diplomats meang that some, if they were found to have committed\nthe crime, could be arrested for it.  Libyans, however, would not grant access. refore, after five days  surroundg\nthe embassy, the British severed diplomatic relations with Libya, givg them another\nweek to leave the embassy  country. This, you see, is what countries can do when\ndiplomats misbehave. y can’t go to the embassy buildg,\nthey can’t arrest diplomats, but they can kick them out  their country. After this cident, diplomatic relations\nbetween the two countries didn’t normalize for decades , even today,  2019, the\ncase is still actively under vestigation  its quite possible an arrest could happen\n the future. Normally, though, embassies are more concerned\nwith buildg diplomacy. Typically, but not always, embassies are headed\nup by an ambassador. Sometimes, though, there are lapses where\none goes without an ambassador for a period  time  other times, a country might choose\nto recall their ambassador as a sign  displeasure. Now, the job  ambassador is tough to defe. In the simplest sce, an Ambassador is there\nto represent their country but what that entails varies wildly from person to person  post\nto post. re’s ten a perception that all that\nambassadors do is schmooze  booze but, to be honest, that’s part  the job. y’re there to build  mata relationships\nwith those that can help their country—politically, economically, or otherwise. That’s just part  diplomacy which is what\nthe embassy’s job as a whole is. This can be direct diplomacy, where the ambassador\nmight meet directly with a head  state, or st diplomacy. St diplomacy can be thgs like  sendg\npas to foreign zoos, the US fundg scholarships for foreign students, or France settg up\na branch  the Louvre   . y are more subtle ways that a nation can\ncurry public favor with another. On a smaller scale, embassies will ten have\na portion  staff dedicated to promotg  exhibitg the art  culture  their\ncountry  the region. You’ll ten see embassies fancially supportg\n sponsorg concerts  their country’s , for example. Now,  addition to these ways  representg\none’s country, the embassy also represents its homel through its actual buildg. As the public face  one country  another,\nit’s got to look the part. For example, some  the world’s most impressive\n important embassies are  Washgton, DC given that nearly every nation has a diplomatic\nmission there.  Chese embassy buildg was designed\nby the children  I.M. Pei, a CheseAmerican regarded as one  the world’s greatest\narchitects,  evokes the same sense  clean, contemporary greur  opulence common\nwith the greatest buildgs back  the People’s  itself while still adherg to Feng\nShui prciples. Just down the street there’s the embassy\nbuildg  the United Arab Emirates—a perhaps even more opulent structure clearly corporatg\naspects  Islamic Architecture. This buildg seems to purposefully comm\na presence with its open sightle from the street allowg one to look   up. n there’s this section  the British\nEmbassy complex nearby—a structure resemblg an old English Country Manor. While countries like   UAE might be\nmore focused on pushg their modern image as newly wealthy nations, countries like the\n might draw more attention to their long  storied past. re’s then the whole realm  the architecture\n American embassy complexes themselves. With necessity, after countless attacks on\nits embassies through history, the architecture  design  American embassy buildgs evokes\nsecurity. Whether its the one  Berl, Beijg, Bern,\nor Bangkok, they all have the look  a compound. y’re mostly modern, novative designs,\na conscious choice to associate these values to the nation’s image, but they’re still\nmostly hidden behd tall walls  fences. re are still some, though, mostly  places\nwhere security is less  a concern, reflectg the earlier architectural style  the US\nsuch as the rgian House  the US Embassy  Canberra, Australia—a buildg that would\nlook right at place  the American south. But when embassies are  certa places their\nbuildgs can’t just be compoundstyle. y have to be compounds. As the physical representations  countries,\nembassies are the clearest targets for those wishg to send a message to a country. Durg wars, though, there is ten more work\nthan ever for embassies to do  a country. This is why, as mentioned earlier, the US\nembassy  Baghdad, Iraq, ballooned to over 16,000 staff durg the Iraq War.  embassy buildg was built  the Green\nZone—a highly fortified area along the Tigris River  Baghdad. This area, guarded by soldiers  walls more\nthan ne feet or three meters tall, was  still is home to much  the ternational\npresence  Baghdad. That cluded embassies  countries like\nthe US, ,  Australia, but also some companies. War is big busess  the Green Zone was\nhome to small field headquarters for many large, ternational engeerg, construction,\n private military firms contracted to help  the war. That is to say, the Green Zone was primarily\nhome to a large group  civilians workg  Iraq which is why it was so heavily guarded. Given the security threat, the US embassy\nthere was built to be entirely self sufficient. It has its own generators, its own wells,\nits own water filtration plant, its own sewage plant, its own fire station, it even has its\nown ternet uplk to circumvent the Iraqi network. It has its own phone network—both wired\n wireless—which both operate pretty much as if they were  the US—they use the area\ncodes  New York  Virgia. Unlike  most cities where embassy staff\njust live  normal housg  the city, this embassy has its own block  fortified apartments. Even durg the thick  the war, the embassy\ncompound had its own swimmg pool, tennis courts, fitness center, department store,\nnail salon,  movie theatre. Toppg it f is a helicopter pad—used\nto get the ambassador  other top diplomats around the country when they don’t want\nto confront the dangers  below.  diplomats servg as part  the US embassy\n Baghdad do get another perk  addition to the pool  tennis courts  movie theatre\n everythg else—they get more money. You see, when workg  the US foreign service,\n its ten similar when workg for other countries’ foreign service, you essentially\nget more money the more foreign a place you go. If you’re servg pretty much anywhere \nNorth America, Western Europe, Australasia,  a few other assorted countries, you get\nno bonus. If you serve  a place that has an extreme\nclimate, poor quality  healthcare, high crime, high pollution, or has any other factor\nthat makes it more difficult to live there as a foreigner, you get hardship pay which\nis a bonus that ranges anywhere from 5% to 35%. That 5% rate cludes places like Costa Rica,\nthe Bahamas, Malta,  Bulgaria while the 35% rate is reserved for places like the Central\nAfrican , Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,  Pakistan. That rate  hardship pay can also vary with\na country. For example, if you served at the US consulate\n Dubai you’d only get a 5% bonus while servg at the US embassy    would\nget you 10%. re are also some places that, well, just\ndon’t seem all that hard to live  but do earn you hardship pay such as Ponta Delgada,\nPortugal, a wellknown vacation destation. This is likely only cluded because  its\nisolation. On top  hardship pay, you can also get an\nadditional bonus if you serve  a place that is deemed dangerous. For example, PortauPrce, Haiti, gets you\n15% while places like Tripoli, Damascus, Kabul, Baghdad,  Juba will get you a 35% bonus. So,  a place like Baghdad, you get a 70%\nbonus just for the hardship  danger you put yourself through. This is how they get people to work at even\nthe harshest  postgs without forcg them. On top  these two, there are also some other\nbonuses based f thgs like high cost  livg, difficulty  staffg the post, \nmore. Now,  the modern age, some have questioned\nwhether embassies still have a purpose. 100 years ago they very much had a purpose\nas communication was difficult, travel was slow,  countries therefore needed someone\non the ground who could speak on their behalf to others at a moment’s notice. Nowadays, though, messages can be relayed\nstantaneously through a whole host  means so what’s the pot? Well, ambassadors are not messengers. Ambassadors are representatives. y are there not only to work for their\ncountry with political systems, but also to promote it to the public as to crease\ntravel  trade with their country. Many argue,  fact, that these small, personal\nrelationships  our world’s diplomats tyg together countries  hundreds  millions\nor billions are more important now than ever. If you want to work  the foreign service,\nthe US State Department has an extensive readg list  books that will help to get the knowledge\nyou need no matter which country you’re from. One book on there that I found quite terestg\nwas, “Blk:  Power  g Without g,” by Malcolm Gladwell.  book is all about how the unconscious\nbra works  makg decisions with very limited fo.

warrant for his house to vestigate the prostitutes allegations [] once they go side the house they fd where Cynthia had been held  the sunken livg room area they see the bed they see the pole that there's some chas  manacles there there's a bucket with her waist on the floor [] there was obvious signs  a struggle  disarray  the room obviously what they saw did not look like the area  somebody who had been kept there voluntarily the such team also found a collection  sister sexual devices everythg that they were seeg did nothg for them except to add evidence  corroboration to what Cynthia their victim was tellg them but nothg could prepare them for what they would fd side a simple white trailer at the side  Parker Ray's house wasn't really until the utility trailer was open that we really began to get a good understg  what we were potentially dealg with then Pora's box was open  the desert town  Truth or Consequences prostitute Cynthia V Hill was recoverg  hospital she had escaped from three days  sexual torture at the hs  David Parker ray Parker ray had been arrested he was a 59 year old mechanic  a father  two foreign state Renuka Richard David Ray he claimed that the prostitute had agreed to a session  rough bondage yes you do at Parker Ray's house the police were discoverg the horrifyg truth the search team had arrived at a seemgly nocuous white trailer it was pretty pretty amazg it was remarkable I'd never seen anythg like it  my life the first thg my eyes focused on was this black chair which turned out to be a gynecology chair just sittg there empty there was medical equipment  everywhere drills modified drills with sexual devices on them  cages I mean it was just this unbelievable lookg den this was a torture chamber David Paulk array cooled the trailer his toy box or Satan's den to see it the first time just kd  gave you a feelg  sickness  it was just remarkable how everythg was set up everythg  here denoted pa everythg  here denoted destruction there were several several items  there that were obviously meticulously crafted by h  were very very sister David was known as very adept with his hs as an excellent mechanic by day Parker ray worked for the local state park he was well respected for his technical ability to those who knew him he was not the kd  man who tortured women  his spare time oh he was just a real nice guy he just real nice real smart he was always eager to help these other guys do thgs you know around here these are some he made he named them stk catchers that's a rope trim piece  pipe just makg anythg it's for the creative piece  work you get down then he had an ankle spreader this looks like somethg that he would have made  he has a labeled ankle spreader he could get a woman  virtually any position that he wanted her  she was his sex slave when they entered this this trailer  then he had the dildo fashioned out  looks like a plastic pipe actually these are nails that have been melted to this plastic collar  this would be serted  her vaga or anal canal  he would work it  work it until he could get it all the way   then they would have these spikes here they're gog to go  you're gonna get poked it's gog to be very paful  rip their ner thighs out I have to wonder how many people came  contact with all this stuff [] Palka raise terrifyg den was evidence  a long campaign  sexual torture the consensus was pretty clear that there were gonna be additional victims here for example the utility trailer was taken apart virtually  we collected trkets rgs necklaces jewelry they came from somebody despite police appeals for more women to come forward Cynthia was still the only known victim but as a prostitute  drug addict she might not be believed  court the police needed more credible witnesses side the toy box Paul Caray had set up two video cameras the suspicion was that he had recorded the sufferg  his captives it made sense to believe  was logical to deduce that there were videotapes somewhere  many many were found who were probably a hundred at least a hundred most  the tapes conta nothg  relevance but one would prove explosive it showed Parker ray testg his equipment then it cut  when it came back to life Parker ray was with a captive it's what you see here is the side  the toy box you see a youngish blondhaired woman with david strapped down naked he's stg over top  her or kneelg next to her at all times he's constantly touchg her  it's obvious that he's tryg to get some kd  sexual gratification out  this she appeared to be unconscious or at least unresponsive to anythg he was dog to her this hasn't had any  the earmarks  a consensual encounter between two people who just enjoy this kd  behavior the videotape was crucial evidence  another victim but who she was was a mystery we're lookg at this videotape  we need to know who this person is he moves her leg at one pot  what's exposed on her right calf on the outside  her right calf is a tattoo  you can see it  the video but it's not clear  it looks like a pretty you know it looked like a pretty big tattoo so we took this tape to the FBI to have it enhanced once the image was enhanced we provided that to the media very shortly afterwards a woman came forward  said that's my tattoo that's me that tattoo I have is unique nobody else has it Cali Van Cleave was a 25 year old child mder she was a friend  Parker Ray's daughter but had no recollection  ever gog to his house  no idea or the FBI had a picture  her tattoo they told me that it came f  a a video they found  David's house  I box as they called it it was weird  I was scared itially it was clear that she was havg difficulty rememberg everythg that had happened to her  the utility trailer   her experience with David before the FBI contacted me I used to have nightmares  beg tied to a table or hcuffs or duct tape scared me but I could never put any  it together  then when the FBI called then I knew they weren't just dreams nightmares they were real Kelly was strugglg to remember the details  what Parker Ray had done to her but the police have made a chillg discovery  Parker Ray's house which would expla everythg a tape recordg  his own voice that he played to itiate his victims hello there bitch I'm gog to tell you  detail why you have been kidnapped what's gog to happen to you this was sister stuff now you are obviously here agast your will you're gonna be kept chaed  a variety  different positions usually with your legs our knees forced wide apart you'll be raped thoroughly  repeatedly  every holy  God midway through the tape revealed that Kelly's memory loss may have been no accident you're gonna be drugged up real heavy with a combation ova sodium pentothal  phenobarbital you're not gonna remember a fuckg thg about this little adventure or what has happened to you sodium pentothal  phenobarbital numb pa  duce amnesia it seemed Parker Rae was usg drugs to control his victims  ensure they would not remember his crimes maybe expla some  the thgs that were done to me beg tied down  how uncomfortable you're gonna feel  beg used as a sex slave Parker ray release Kelly three days after takg a captive confident that she would never remember her ordeal [] [] [] but as the police questioned her memories started to surface over time she was able to piece together elements  her captivity  the toy box I didn't know how long I had been there I could see under the duct tape once  a while had all kds  six devices he whips  chas  stuff I remember him comg  gog several times but I don't know how many times when he was  there he was  there for a long time I was scared I remember tellg him that I wanted to go home I didn't know if he was gonna kill me or not I don't ever remember drkg or eatg anythg he let me up to use a porta potty once but I was shackled to do that I remember him usg different kds  toys on me  they hurt that's about all I remember the police now had a credible witness but not necessarily one who could get Parker ray behd bars potential weakness that she had she didn't remember certa thgs she didn't have a clear recollection  others  that weakens the case  the overall picture that the jury is gog to be given  exactly what David was up to the prosecution needed more  by Paul corazon admission there were many more victims to fd  his tape recordgs he dicated that he had been volved  sexual assault sce he was 15 David was arrested when he was 59 so he has approximately  years  practice as  the time this tape was made I've taken 37 women for these purposes maybe more but now with so many victims unaccounted for there was a fear that Parker Ray was more than a sadistic torture he could be a prolific serial killer you are expendable it may sound harsh  cold but I won't have any qualms at all about slicg your throat if you believe what David says on the tape is true that he rapes  tortures women there's no reason not to believe the other parts about killg women  disposg  their bodies is also true death was a constantly resurfacg idea from David not from us but from David  his writgs  his drawgs  his tapes everythg revolved around death I've never had any question that David Parker ray is a serial killer there's never been a doubt  my md about it whether the case was gog to be a murder trial would depend on whether we could lk gave it to the actual killg  victims if Paul Caray was a serial killer he lived  the perfect place to hide the bodies his house was on the shores  Elephant Butte Lake a3 miles long  200 feet deep it's the largest body  water  New Mexico there was a map that we recovered  David Parker Ray's house that was just a map  the lake with X's on it David had a sailboat a large skiff sailg boat with depth fdg equipment  he knew that Lake very very well  he knew where the deepest places  that lake work I was hopg that we were gog to have a body I was prayg that we were gog to have a body there were overall like between two  three full dive missions that were performed there without beg able to locate any evidence that we could connect defitively to the Parker ray vestigation David had the perfect job if he wants to hide bodies or whatever he had access to every nook  cranny  Elephant Butte State Park he had access to areas that are kept under lock  key that keep the public away from but to which he had access we searched caves holes  the ground wells mes lakes we searched everywhere we could possibly thk that was endlessly frustratg [] the case agast Parker ray was weak the best witness had a patchy memory  unless bodies could be found there was a chance that a murderer would walk free he was an telligent man  capable  gog the extra mile  makg an extra effort especially when it came to this kd  behavior to do what he needed to do to avoid detection  I believe that's what he did but Parker Ray hadn't thought  everythg an extraordary confession from one  his acquatances was about to blow the vestigation wide open police believed that victims  David Parker Ray's campaign  sexual torture were buried  the New Mexico desert but no bodies have been discovered  the case agast him was on rocky ground the only known survivg victims were a hero addicted prostitute  a woman whose memory  her captivity had been scrambled by Parker Ray's cocktail  drugs but Cali Van Cleave clearly remembered what happened before she was drugged  July 1996 she was abducted from this once bustlg bar on the outskirts  Truth or Consequences we rounded up a bunch  friends  went barhoppg  this is where we ended up we always ended up here no matter where we started this is where we quit there used to be a little mi bar sittg here pull tables right there then we were playg pool  I had ordered a beer  I left to take one  my drunk friends home  came back  some  my other friends left  at the end  the eveng it was just me  Jessie Jesse ray David's daughter Jessie agreed to give Kelly a lift home but she drove straight to her father's house the fact that it was his own daughter kidnappg just shows the depth  his resolve when it came to this behavior   also showed his lack  emotional volvement with just about anybody or anythg I just remember beg on her couch her dad's couch that's when they held the knife to my throat I put the dog collar on we duct tape  hcuffs  I ended up tied to a table Jesse ray was arrested for her role  Kelly's abduction are you optimistic that you'll be out soon what it wasn't the only time she'd taken someone home to meet her father  July 1997 one year after Kelly's abduction a friend  hers had gone missg from the same bar Marie Parker was a 21 year old mother  two it was almost midnight  she said she was gonna go home  check out her kids she'd be right back by the time the bar closed at 2:00 o'clock she still wasn't there  her car was still there so but somebody said Jesse followed Maria no one has heard from the reap our curses that night she had two little girls there was no way she was gonna leave her kids so I knew somethg had happened the similarities between Kelly's abduction  Marie's disappearance seemed unlikely to be cocidence she's a woman that disappeared about two years ago you know with Marie Parker we knew he was volved but we didn't have enough formation or evidence to p anythg on him you were a part  that on the night Marie disappeared Jessie Ray had been at the bar with a friend  her father's called Roy Yancy the police suspected he was an accomplice  brought him  for questiong his statement was astonishg from what I underst is that he's had many years  kidnappg  torturg  killg women from the story that Roy gave was that Marie Parker had  fact been a victim  David Parker ray that she had been abducted while she was  the toy box she was systematically tortured over a period  a couple  days when she wasn't beg tortured she was placed on a cot  slid underneath a part  the the the wall  the toy box that they could shut  lock  at the end  all  this the formation that Roy Yancy gave us was that he was structed to kill Marie Parker by strangulation how did you come up with the idea to kill Marie David Ray Parker's idea that's pretty remarkable it just seemed like it went up to a different level  each level went up to it became more overwhelmg  then I began to wonder just know where is it gonna end I know they ended up givg me a rope  tellg me  okay but you thk he wouldn't die  fast enough was he strugglg or yes we have no doubt that his statement was accurate his details were such that it's unquestionable that Roy Yancy killed Marie Parker I was told not to tell anybody anythg or I was gonna be killed  thrown to dips  who told you that if rui NC could take the police to Marie Parker's body that fally have the evidence to lk Parker ray to murder David  Roy accordg to Roy Yancy took the body out to a remote location  the desert rolled it down a rave covered it up with a little bit  dirt  then drove back  Roy was very specific  detailed about the location where this happened he remembered he said pretty well where this was we felt it if we were able to locate this body it was gog to be a domo effect  soon this was gog to lead to more  more  more we spent the better part  a week with Roy Yancy gog to several different locations we had 0 people out lookg  these areas we had helicopters out lookg  these areas  still we weren't able to recover a body  Roy's I guess hypothesis which seems to be credible  make sense is that David returned to that location after the body had been disposed   relocated it yet aga David Paulk array had been meticulous  avoidg detection we spent a great deal  time chasg an telligent man who was well versed  what he was dog   certaly able to cover his tracks very effectively we were always one step behd him there's thouss upon thouss  deep narrow raves nooks  crannies  where do you look we could be stg above her right now  never know it  I ten wonder how close did we actually come to to her or some  the victims durg the course  this Roy Yancy pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder  was sentenced to 20 years but David Parker ray mataed his nocence  without Mary Parker's body murder charges could not be brought agast him it's extremely frustratg to know that he's committed murders  yet not have sufficient evidence to brg this matter to a resolution  a court  law but the fact that we couldn't prosecute him for murder made it all the more important that was successfully prosecuted for the rape torture kidnappgs that we could prove  court that he did the trial  David Parker ray began on the 29th  June 2000 his fate now lay entirely  the hs  Kelli Van Cleve despite her patchy memory she would have to convce a jury that he had kidnapped  sexually tortured her I didn't want to go to court I didn't have to go face him but I did it he couldn't be out on the streets any longer had to do it because I had to do what I could to save other women as Kelly took the st Parker Rae was just feet away it was the first time she'd seen him sce her captivity he was just sittg there with a smug look on his face  it pissed me f he acted like he was totally nocent  he had done nothg wrong I didn't want to cry  let him know how much he hurt me I didn't want to be his victim that was difficult Kelly explaed what she could  her ordeal  the toy box but under crossexamation she was attacked rigorously the defense potview has to be  this case that she's not a credible witness  therefore should not be believed because she couldn't remember what happened you sit up there on the st  wonder are these guys gonna believe me David's story was that she came over quite willgly that I had some beers  that she had consensual sex that the the sex became kkier as she stayed longer  that he cleaned her up  sent her home at the end  it just lies I thk that was the most difficult part was all the lies that they said I could have faced David without the lies people ten do thgs that they can't live with  so they have to change the way they feel about what happened or the way they report what happened or the way they feel about themselves to account for that the defense's claims that Kelly had consented to be  the toy box were contradicted by Park RA himself on the itiation tape that he played his victims you are obviously here agast your will you'll be raped thoroughly  repeatedly  every holy  God but there was a problem Kelly could not remember if Parker Rae had played the tape to her so the judge ruled it was not relevant the jury was not allowed to hear it the suppression  the audio tape weakened our case because they were not able to hear David's actual planng preparation  his own voice they're gog to be kept like an animal as far as I'm concerned you're a pretty piece  meat your pussy  asshole is gonna get a real workout this was essentially a confession the prosecution did have one more weapon to draw on the video footage  Parker ray torturg Kelly  the toy box when you look at the tape you see that there's no evidence  jury because he's not beatg her he's touchg her gently he caresses her breast he lightly rubs her stomach he lightly rubs her arms she's able to sit there  loosen up her jots  the way you would if you'd done somethg strenuous  that was our terpretation  the tape I knew the defense was gonna try to turn everythg around on me but I didn't thk that with the tape I figured everybody would know everybody could see I wasn't there willgly after a twoweek trial the jury retired to consider whether Kelly's testimony was enough to lock up our Caray for life Kelly's the one who the jury has to believe  order for them to return a guilty verdict I didn't thk there was gog to be any way that a jury would come back with a not guilty verdict  this when they fally made a decision  everybody got back to the courtroom I knew it was gonna be a guilty verdict it had to have been a guilty verdict they fooled me the judge required a unanimous decision  on July the 13th 2000 the jury announced the verdict some jurors did not believe Kelly's testimony so Parker ray could not be convicted it was a hung jury when they came back with a hung jury verdict I about fated literally I didn't underst it the decision was made to retry the case this time with a different jury  a different judge I didn't want to go through court aga but I had to he was not gonna hurt anybody else [] ne months after the first trial ended the retrial got underway  a boost to the prosecution the new judge decided that Parker Ray's itiation tape was relevant to the case  allowed it to be heard Parker raised voice filled the courtroom hello there bitch here probably thk you're gonna be raped  you're buck sure right about that remember hearg his voice  it sends shivers down my spe you're not gonna remember a fuckg thg about this little adventure it was like you could cut through the air with a knife as far as I'm concerned you're a pretty piece  meat be smart  be a survivor have a nice day the audiotape was a crucial piece  evidence but everythg rested on Kelly's testimony for Parker ray to be found guilty Kelly would have to take the st once aga  convced the entire jury that she had been kidnapped  tortured I was vulnerable I was scared but I was angry that he got away with the first one was he gonna get away with the second one the police believe that David Parker ray was a serial killer but as no bodies had been found he couldn't be charged with murder stead he had been tried for the kidnap rape  torture  Kelly Van Cleave but at the first trial the jury had been unable to agree unanimously that he was guilty at the retrial once aga everythg rested on Kelly unless her testimony was believed by the entire jury the charges agast Parker ray could be dropped it's very difficult to tell people you don't know timate thgs sexual thgs about your life we tested her credibility  the fire  crossexamation  trial twice her life must have been hell I thk it was harder the second time than it was the first time because I had already been there I already had to tell my my story to thouss  people I didn't know []  that first jury didn't believe me on April the 16th 2001 after a weeklong trial the jury retired to consider what they'd heard it took them just five hours to reach a unanimous verdict I was sweatg I didn't know what they were gonna say had no idea [] we got guilty then they got 22 years  prison  we partied do you believe Kelly's version  events was true so the question is whether I believe that she was abducted by the REA family  held captive   raped  tortured yeah I believe it but you'll his defense attorney you seem to be sayg that your client is guilty I do seem to be sayg that Don I  a deal with the prosecution David Parker ray gave up his right to appeal  return his daughter Jessie was released without trial for her role  Kelly's abduction I knew that not everybody I would ever defend would be nocent I knew that some  the people that I represented would be  bad people  I believe that on the spectrum  people who do not belong  society David Parker ray is right  there [] was justice done don't thk justice can ever be done  these types  cases what David did to these women no amount  punishment to him can take away what those women have to live with David took too much  me away I feel like I'm a totally different person I don't go anywhere I don't trust anybody I miss the old me the one that used to be wild  crazy  sassy  wasn't scared I would do just about anythg to get the old lay back I wish he wouldn't have died I want him alive I would ask him why why me why did he take me home why didn't he kill me I wish he was still alive so he could tell us what happened to all those other girls where he buried him how he killed them so those other families could have some closure [] you [] you"
